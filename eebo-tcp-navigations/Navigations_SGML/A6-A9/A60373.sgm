<HEAD>TO THE READER.</HEAD>
<P>IT's a Matter worthy of ones enquiry, how a Nation, as <HI>SCOT|LAND,</HI> &s;o much addicted to <HI>Military Arts,</HI> and &s;o con&s;tantly ingaged in both Foreign and Dome&s;tick Wars, &s;hould have been in a Capacity to erect &s;uch &s;uperb Edifices as that Kingdom abounds with. There is no Country in <HI>Europe</HI> that can brag either of greater Piles of Buildings, or a more regular Architecture in its Ancient Churches and Religious Fabricks, than <HI>Scotland</HI> was Mi&s;tre&s;s of about an Age or Two ago. To in&s;tance One for all, the Metropolitan Church of St. <HI>Andrews</HI> was probably the bige&s;t in <HI>Chri|&s;tendom,</HI> being Seven Foot longer and Two Foot broader than that of St. <HI>Peter</HI> at <HI>Rome</HI>; and for the Heighth and Embelli&s;hing of its Pillars and Roof, the Beauty of its Stones, and Simetry of its parts, was one of the be&s;t of the <HI>Gothick</HI> kind in the World.</P>
<P><HI>READER,</HI> You may receive this Impartial Account from me as a Foreigner, who am now &s;ettled in this Nation; and having met with the u&s;ual Civility and Kindne&s;s Strangers are treated with a|mong&s;t them, it is no wonder if I am tempted to leave &s;ome little Marks of Gratitude behind me, in tran&s;mitting to Po&s;terity tho&s;e <HI>Ve|nerable Remains</HI> of former Ages, and oblige other Nations with the Pro|&s;pects of &s;o many con&s;iderable Places; which I pre&s;ume will be very ac|ceptable to them. It is a Work of &s;o great Charge, and will require &s;o many Volumes, that I cannot &s;atisfy the Publick but from Time to Time in it. And according to the Reception the&s;e fir&s;t Endeavours &s;hall meet with, it will encourage me to go on with the re&s;t. In the mean time, I hope no Per&s;on will take Exceptions, though the Towns, and &s;uch of the Nobility, who&s;e Arms are here in&s;erted, are not always placed conform to the Rank they keep in Parliament; it being a Thing which cannot be adju&s;ted in a Work of this Nature till the whole De&s;ign is compleated.</P>

<HEAD> EDINBURGH.</HEAD>
<P><HI>EDINB&V;RGH</HI> is &s;ituated in <HI>Mid-Lothian,</HI> a Shire of <HI>Scot|land.</HI> It is the Chief City of the Kingdom, and Royal Seat. It far &s;urpa&s;&s;eth all the other Cities of the Kingdom in the Stateline&s;s of its Churches, the Beauty and Neatne&s;s of its publick and private Buildings, the Plea&s;antne&s;s of its Site, the Large|ne&s;s of its Precincts, the Number and Opulency of its Inhabitants, and Dignity of its Rulers. By the mo&s;t ancient Inhabitants it was called <HI>Dun Eden</HI>; by the <HI>Latins, Edinodunum,</HI> and by the <HI>Germans, Edin|burghen</HI>; all which &s;ignifie the &s;ame thing.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="7"><HI>Dun Eden</HI> &s;ignifies a Town upon a Hill, or rather a City of the <HI>Edeni,</HI> &s;ituated on a Hill. The <HI>Edeni</HI> are tho&s;e who by <HI>Ptolemy</HI> are termed <HI>Ottodeni,</HI> which Word (as &s;ome Learned Men think) was mi&s;|taken for <HI>Scottodeni,</HI> the two fir&s;t Letters <HI>Sc</HI> being worn out with Time: For near to this City is <HI>Curia Ottodenorum,</HI> who&s;e Name remains to this Day in a Village Four Miles We&s;t from the City, called <HI>Currie</HI>: And two Miles We&s;t from the Town is <HI>Cor&s;topitum</HI> (which al&s;o was among the <HI>Ottodeni</HI>) which is a Village commonly called <HI>Cor&s;torfin.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Ptolomy</HI> calls this Place <GAP DESC="foreign">, <HI>Ca&s;trum alatum,</HI> the <HI>Winged Ca&s;tle,</HI> which is not &s;o called from that kind of Wings which the <HI>Greek</HI> Builders (as &s;ays <HI>Vitruvius</HI>) call <GAP DESC="foreign">, (which are double Walls &s;o ri&s;ing to the Height, that they re&s;emble Wings: For it is likely there was no regular building in that Place at that time) but that they were &s;uch as by the Poet <HI>Juvenal</HI> are called <HI>Ca&s;tella Bri|gantum</HI>; which &s;ort of Ca&s;tles we may &s;ee de&s;cribed by <HI>Tacitus, Annal. Lib.</HI> XII. where he &s;ays, That upon high Mountains, and other Places of difficult Acce&s;s, he built up Stones in Form of a Fence, where the River did run on a &s;lippery Ford. Now the&s;e Fences of Stone were nothing el&s;e, but Stones ca&s;t together without Mortar, which is al&s;o clear from the &s;ame Author in the fore-cited Place, where he &s;ays, The Souldiers holding their Bucklers over their Heads for a Defence, pulled down the unwrought and ill-built Stones; which could not have been &s;o ea&s;ily done, if they had not been ca&s;t together without Mortar. And certainly our Ance&s;tors cho&s;e out this as a very fit Place for a Fort of that Nature: For the Hill where the Ca&s;tle &s;tands is exceeding &s;teep and craggy, and the A&s;cent very difficult, except where it looks to the Ea&s;t, which Part they fortified with Stones ca&s;t together as before. The A&s;cent on which the City now &s;tands had, and yet hath upon the North-&s;ide, a &s;tanding Pool, which is commonly called the <HI>North-Loch.</HI> Upon the South-&s;ide of the Hill there was likewi&s;e another &s;tanding-Pool called the <HI>South-Loch:</HI> The Verity of which the Rights and Lea|&s;es of &s;ome Hou&s;es of St. <HI>Ninian</HI>'s Row, do te&s;tifie, which are let with the Privilege of a Boat annexed; and the&s;e two <HI>Lochs</HI> or <HI>Lakes</HI> bounded the City upon the&s;e two Sides, as the <HI>North-Loch</HI> does it at this Day upon the North-&s;ide; but the <HI>South-Loch</HI> was drained a Hun|dred Years ago, and upon the Banks thereof are built two &s;everal Tracts of Hou&s;es, between which (in the Place where the <HI>Loch</HI> it &s;elf &s;tood) is a Street called the <HI>Cowgate.</HI> And &s;o the Breadth of the City
<PB N="3" REF="7">
toward the South, is far extended beyond its former Limits; as like|wi&s;e the Length thereof toward the We&s;t is much enlarged, for the Gra&s;s Market and Hor&s;e Market are now within the City-Wall.</P>
<P>The Rea&s;on why this Place is called <HI>Ca&s;trum Alatum,</HI> or <HI>The winged Ca&s;tle,</HI> is to be taken from the very Nature of the Place: For, be&s;ides the Lakes on both &s;ides, there are two Hills near the Rock on which the Ca&s;tle &s;tands, <HI>viz. Sarisbury</HI> and <HI>Neils Craigs,</HI> &s;o named from the &s;ometime Owners thereof, which in a manner re&s;emble Wings, as is ea&s;ily perceived Coming to the City from the South-Ea&s;t by the Sea Side; for then the&s;e Rocks appear like Wings &s;tretched forth, and the Rock on which the Ca&s;tle &s;tands, like the Head of a Bird with a Tuft. And this is the genuine Derivation of the Word.</P>
<P>I know there are &s;ome learned Per&s;ons who will have <HI>Ptolomy</HI>'s <HI>Ca&s;trum Alatum,</HI> to be in another part of the Country, and not to be <HI>Edinodu|num,</HI> &s;eeing he makes his <GAP DESC="foreign"> to be among&s;t the <HI>Vacomagi</HI>; but <HI>Ptolomy</HI> mu&s;t be born with in all his Mi&s;takes of the Situation of Pla|ces here; for being an <HI>Egyptian,</HI> living in <HI>Alexandria,</HI> and forced to take things upon Tru&s;t, and follow the Relation of others, it is no Wonder if he be &s;ometimes mi&s;taken.</P>
<P>The greater Part of the City is built upon the A&s;cent, and it is very probable that the Ca&s;tle has been the Cau&s;e of Building the City: For fir&s;t the Neighbours have built a few Hou&s;es near the Ca&s;tle, that under the Reach thereof they might be defended from the Injuries of their Enemies. The Number of the People growing apace, the Num|ber of the Hou&s;es likewi&s;e encrea&s;ed, and &s;tretched forth to the very Foot of the A&s;cent toward the Ea&s;t; by which the City, together with the Suburbs of the <HI>Canon-gate</HI> and King's Palace, is become one entire <HI>Scotch</HI> Mile in length; but in breadth it is le&s;s by the half, notwith|&s;tanding the Suburbs be included. The High Street from the Ca&s;tle to the Abbey is adorned with &s;tately Buildings, which are of late made of hewen Stone, &s;ince that by an Act of the Town-Council it hath been prohibited (for the frequent burnings which happened) to build any more Timber-Hou&s;es either in the City or Suburbs.</P>
<P>The great Breadth of the High Street, and of the many Lanes which lie on each &s;ide the &s;ame, from the North to the South (which &s;end up the Air as it were in Pipes into the High Street) and the Nearne&s;s of the two Hills called <HI>Neils Craigs</HI> on the North, and <HI>Sarisbury Craigs</HI> on the South, do always refre&s;h the
<PB N="4" REF="8">
Town with Air; which conduces not a little to the Whole&s;omene&s;s hereof, and it was never heard that the Plague raged in it, except brought in thither by infected Wares. Which Purity of the Air is daily encrea&s;ed &s;ince the Time that excellent fre&s;h Water was brought into the City from a Fountain three Miles di&s;tant from the &s;ame, and that by a mo&s;t wi&s;e Act of the Council all Na&s;tine&s;s is removed.</P>
<P>The City is enclo&s;ed with a kind of an Old <HI>Roman</HI> Wall on every &s;ide, except towards the North, where the <HI>North-Loch</HI> does &s;ecure it in&s;tead of a Wall.</P>
<P>The City is entered by &s;ix Gates or Ports: Two of which are to the Ea&s;t, two to the South, one to the We&s;t, and one lately made to the North.</P>
<P>One of the Gates to the Ea&s;t is called the <HI>Netherbow,</HI> which in the Year 1616, was magnificently rebuilt, being the chief Gate of the City, adorned with Towers on both &s;ides.</P>
<P>The other Gate to the Ea&s;t is called the <HI>Cowgate Port,</HI> through which there is an Entry into the Nether Street, of the length of the whole City, and is called the <HI>Cowgate.</HI></P>
<P>The Ea&s;tmo&s;t of the&s;e Gates to the South (through which is an Entry into the City) is called the <HI>Potter-Row Port,</HI> from the Suburb called the <HI>Potter-Row.</HI></P>
<P>The We&s;tmo&s;t of the&s;e is called the <HI>Society Port,</HI> properly the <HI>Brewer</HI>'s <HI>Port.</HI> They have a great &s;quare Court in that Place, with Buildings and brave Hou&s;es round about it, to the very Walls of the City.</P>
<P>The We&s;t-Gate at the other End of the City, lying beneath the Ca&s;tle, affords an Entry from the Suburb of the &s;ame Name.</P>
<P>The North-Gate, which was la&s;t made at the Lower End of the <HI>North-Loch,</HI> is twofold, the Inner and the Outer Port, through which there is an Entry into the City from the Suburb called the <HI>Mutter</HI>'s <HI>Hill.</HI></P>
<P>There are two Streets extending the whole length of the Town. The chief Street which is al&s;o called the Higher, is one of the broade&s;t in <HI>Europe</HI>: From it there run many Lanes on both &s;ides. The Nether or Lower Street hath al&s;o many Lanes running to the South.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="8">In the very middle of the City there is a Cathedral Church, which is called St. <HI>Giles</HI>'s Church, of &s;uch Largene&s;s that it is divided into three Churches, every one of which has its own Pari&s;h. It is built of hewen Stone, adorned with Pillars and <HI>Vaultings</HI> of Stone. In the middle it forms a perfect Cro&s;s, by four Parts of this Church meeting together, and they &s;upport a &s;tately, high Tower, with a Top of curious Workman-&s;hip, repre|&s;enting an Imperial Crown. Be&s;ide this Cathedral Church there are in the City,</P>
<P>The South-Church, called the <HI>Gray-Friars</HI> Church, which &s;tands in the middle of the common Burial-place. Many Tombs and Monuments do &s;urround the Church-Yard, among&s;t which that of Sir <HI>George Mackenzy</HI> does appear like a <HI>Mau&s;olaeum.</HI></P>
<P>There is al&s;o a Church of &s;quare hewen Stone with a Tower built in the Year 1641, which is called the <HI>Trone</HI>-Church.</P>
<P>The Collegiate-Church of the <HI>Sacred Trinity,</HI> was built by <HI>Mary</HI> of <HI>Gueldres,</HI> King <HI>James</HI> the &s;econd's Queen, where al&s;o &s;he lies interred.</P>
<P>Near to this Church is the Ho&s;pital of St. <HI>Thomas,</HI> in which the poorer &s;ort of Inhabitants, both Men and Women, are maintained &s;plendidly enough, and have their own proper Chaplain.</P>
<P>Over-again&s;t this Church is the <HI>Correction-Hou&s;e,</HI> commonly called <HI>Paul</HI>'s <HI>Work,</HI> in which there are divers Manufacturies of Linen, Wooll and Silk, where di&s;&s;olute Per&s;ons are forced to earn their Living with their Labour.</P>
<P>The <HI>Lady Ye&s;ter</HI>'s Church, was built by one of the Lady <HI>Ye&s;ters,</HI> who al&s;o left a Summ of Money for maintaining a good and able Man to preach and perform Divine Service therein.</P>

<P>Upon the South-&s;ide is the College of King <HI>James</HI> the VI. founded in the Year 1580, endowed with all the Privileges of an Univer&s;ity. It hath mo&s;t large Precincts inclo&s;ed with Walls and divided into Three Courts, Two Lower and One Higher, which is equal to both the other in Largene&s;s. The&s;e Courts or <HI>Area's</HI> are adorned on all &s;ides with excellent Buildings. There is al&s;o a high Tower built over the great Entry.</P>
<P>The publick Schools are large. There is likewi&s;e a very large Com|mon-Hall, in which Theology and the <HI>Hebrew</HI> Tongue is taught, and publick Orations made.

<P><PB N="7" REF="9">The <HI>Ca&s;tle</HI> is &s;ituated at the Head of the Town to the We&s;t, where the Hill doth ri&s;e into a large Top.

The Entry to the Ca&s;tle is from the Town. The chief Defence on this &s;ide is of the round Battery; at the Foot of which there is a de&s;igned Out-work, which is not yet brought to a Condition of Defence, and will add very much to the Strength of it when fini&s;hed. In the Ca&s;tle al&s;o is a Royal Palace of hewen Stone, where the <HI>Regalia</HI> of the King|dom are kept. This Ca&s;tle is the Chief Magazine for the Arms and Ammunition of the Nation, and hath a mo&s;t plea&s;ant Pro&s;pect to the neighbouring Fields, and to the River of <HI>Forth,</HI> from whence it is &s;a|luted by &s;uch Ships of War as come to an Anchor in <HI>Leith</HI> Road.

<P><HI>Heriot</HI>'s <HI>Ho&s;pital</HI> is likewi&s;e within the City, Situated to the We&s;t of the publick Burial-Place.

They have likewi&s;e a Chaplain to in&s;truct them in the Grounds of Learning, till they be fitted for the publick Schools and Colleges.</P>
<P>This Ho&s;pital was founded by <HI>George Heriot,</HI> Jeweller to King <HI>James</HI> the VI. who was de&s;cended of the Family of <HI>Trebroun</HI>; and after he had lo&s;t two Sons by Shipwrack going from <HI>Scotland</HI> for <HI>London,</HI> where dying without I&s;&s;ue, <HI>February</HI> the 15<HI>th.</HI> 1624. he left in Legacy to this Ho&s;pital Two Hundred Thou&s;and Pounds <HI>Scots</HI> Money, that Youth might be maintain'd therein, and in&s;tructed in Arts and Sciences till they were of mature Age, having left the City of <HI>Edinburgh</HI> his Executors.</P>
<P>This Fabrick is &s;tately like a Palace, the Statue of the Foun|der being erected upon the inner Fronti&s;piece. Round about the Hou&s;es are mo&s;t plea&s;ant Gardens adorned with large Walks and plea|&s;ant Greens.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="10">Without the Walls of the City are the Suburbs, among&s;t which that which lies from the <HI>Netherbow</HI> to the Abbey, called the <HI>Cannon-gate,</HI> hath the Preheminence.

On the South-&s;ide is a very fine Hou&s;e belonging to the Earl of <HI>Murray,</HI> with very plea&s;ant Gardens adjoining.</P>
<P>At the Lower End of this Suburb is the Abbey of <HI>Holyrood-Hou&s;e,</HI> founded by King <HI>David</HI> for the Monks of the Order of St. <HI>Augu&s;tine.</HI> This was con&s;umed by Fire, and the Church only remains, in which divers of our Kings and Queens are interred.</P>
<P>The <HI>Royal Palace</HI> hath four Courts. The Outer Court, which is as big as all the re&s;t, hath four Principal Entries (be&s;ides &s;everal Inlets into the adjacent Gardens) three of which are on the We&s;t, and the other on the Ea&s;t-&s;ide.</P>
<P>The Entry of the Palace is adorned with great Pillars of hewen Stone, and a fine Cupola in Fa&s;hion of a Crown above it. The Fore|part of the Palace is terminated by four high Towers, Two of which toward the North were erected by King <HI>James</HI> the V. and the re&s;t by King <HI>Charles</HI> the II.

<P>The Town is &s;ituate in a Plain on the Bank of the River <HI>Levin,</HI> near the Place where it enters into <HI>Clyde,</HI> a little below the Ca&s;tle, which is excellently fortified by Nature, owing little to Art; and &s;eems to have been built by the Ancient <HI>Brigantes.</HI> This Town had its Privileges procured to it by One of the Counte&s;&s;es of <HI>Lennox.</HI></P>
<P>The Ca&s;tle hath a &s;trange kind of Situation; for where the Waters of <HI>Clyde</HI> and <HI>Levin</HI> meet, there's a Plain extended to the length of a Mile at the Foot of the neighbouring Hills: And in the very Corner of this Meet|ing there ri&s;es a Rock with two Tops, the higher of which looks to
<PB N="12" REF="12">
the We&s;t, with a Watch-Tower on the Top of it, having a large Pro|&s;pect on all Sides. The other being a little lower lies to the Ea&s;t. Be|twixt the&s;e two Tops are Steps hewen out of the Rock with great Pains and Labour, which yield Pa&s;&s;age only to one Per&s;on at a Time, to the upper Part of the Ca&s;tle. To the South where <HI>Clyde</HI> runs by the Rock which is naturally &s;teep, it hath a little De&s;cent, and as it were with out-&s;tretcht Arms embraces the plain Ground; which partly by Nature and partly by Art is &s;o enclo&s;ed, that it furni&s;hes Room for &s;everal Hou&s;es and a Garden. It &s;ecures the Harbour by its Ordnance, and obliges the &s;maller Boats to come up almo&s;t to the very Gate of the Ca&s;tle, the Chanal of the River running on that Side. The mid|dle of the Rock where the Entry to the Ca&s;tle is, being built up with Hou&s;es, makes as it were another Ca&s;tle di&s;tinct from the former. This Ca&s;tle, as appears by its Pro&s;pects, does almo&s;t &s;tand like a Sugar-loaf upon a plain Ground. The Circumference of it is but very &s;mall, and yet it hath at the Top a little kind of a Lake and &s;everal other Springs. Be|&s;ides the natural Fortification, it is bounded on the We&s;t by the Water of <HI>Levin,</HI> and on the South by <HI>Clyde,</HI> which are to it in&s;tead of Ditches. To the Ea&s;t, the Sea at a full Tide beats again&s;t the Foot of the Rock; and when it ebbs it does not leave a Plain of Sand, but of a &s;oft Clay, which is divided by a Rivulet that runs down from the neighbouring Hills.</P>

<P>It was of old called <HI>Binobara,</HI> which by &s;ome is judged to be <HI>Ptolo|my</HI>'s <HI>Vindovara</HI>: For <HI>Bin</HI> in our old Language &s;ignifies a Hill, and <HI>Vara</HI> a River: So that the Name which the Town now retains, is the Signi|fication of the old Name thereof.</P>

<P>SAINT <HI>ANDREWS,</HI> in Latin, <HI>Andreanopolis,</HI> or <HI>Fanum Sancti Andreae,</HI> has its Name from St. <HI>Andrew,</HI> who&s;e Bones are &s;aid to be brought hither from <HI>Patras,</HI> a Town in <HI>Pelopon|ne&s;us,</HI> by <HI>Regulus</HI> a <HI>Grecian</HI> Monk, <HI>Anno</HI> 368. a Man in that Age much e&s;teem'd for Piety, as appears by the Church dedicated to him, and called after his Name. From him al&s;o (as ancient Writers report) this Town was at fir&s;t called <HI>Regimund,</HI> that is, <HI>Mons &s;ancti Reguli</HI>; for we read that <HI>Oengus,</HI> or <HI>&V;ngus,</HI> King of the <HI>Picts,</HI> did grant to <HI>God</HI> and Saint <HI>Andrew,</HI> That he &s;hould be Head of all Churches within the Juris&s;diction of the <HI>Picts.</HI></P>
<P>Likewi&s;e it is manife&s;t from Old Manu&s;cripts, that this was the prin|cipal See of the <HI>Culdai,</HI> who had the care and management of Holy Things from the fir&s;t reception of Chri&s;tianity in tho&s;e Parts.</P>
<P>This City is the <HI>Metropolis</HI> of the whole Kingdom, and the See of an Archbi&s;hop, who is Primate of all <HI>Scotland.</HI> It lies towards the Ea&s;t with a plea&s;ant Pro&s;pect to the Ocean, having a Harbour for Ships, the Sea
<PB N="20" REF="16">
near it plentiful in Fi&s;hes, and Fields whole&s;ome and &s;pacious.</P>
<P>There yet remain the Marks of Venerable Antiquity, the Ruines of the Cathedral Church and Mona&s;tery, which do abundantly te&s;tifie their Ancient Glory and Magnificence. The Town it &s;elf is &s;ituate in a Plain, from Ea&s;t to We&s;t, with a mo&s;t plea&s;ant Pro&s;pect to the <HI>Ger|man</HI> Ocean. It had a very &s;trong Ca&s;tle of Old, who&s;e Rubbi&s;h and Ruines are yet to be &s;een upon the Rocks on the Sea-&s;ide towards the North.

<P>The College of St. <HI>Salvator,</HI> commonly called the <HI>Old College,</HI> was founded by <HI>James Kennedie</HI> Bi&s;hop of St. <HI>Andrews,</HI> together with a Church beautified with an high towering Steeple all of hewen Stone, in which his Monument of curious Workman-&s;hip is yet to be &s;een.

He has al&s;o founded a <HI>Library,</HI> which by the Donations of lear|ned Men is now very well furni&s;hed with good Books.</P>
<P>St. <HI>Leonard</HI>'s College was founded by <HI>James Hepburn,</HI> Prior of St. <HI>Andrews</HI>; in which are &s;everal Profe&s;&s;ors, as fir&s;t the Principal, who is always Doctor of Divinity, and Four Profe&s;&s;ors of Philo&s;ophy, to whom <HI>John Scot</HI> of <HI>Scots Tarvett</HI> Knight, added a Profe&s;&s;or of Philology, with a liberal Salary, and augmented the Library with the Gift of &s;everal con&s;iderable Volumes.</P>

<P>The <HI>New College</HI> was founded by <HI>James Beaton</HI> Archbi&s;hop.

<P><HI>Alexander</HI> the I.

<HEAD> GLASGOW.</HEAD>
<P><HI>GLASGOW</HI> is the mo&s;t famous Empory of all the We&s;t of <HI>Scotland.</HI> Nothwith&s;tanding that it is inferiour to many in Antiquity, yet if we re&s;pect the Largene&s;s of the City, the Number and Stateline&s;s of its publick and private Buildings, its Commerce with Foreign Nations, and the Opulency of its Inhabitants, it is the Chief of all the Cities in the Kingdom next to <HI>Edinburgh.</HI></P>
<P>The City &s;tands mo&s;t plea&s;antly upon the Ea&s;t Bank of <HI>Clyde,</HI> which is navigable up to the very Tower, by Ships of &s;mall Burden; but <HI>New Gla&s;gow</HI> which &s;tands on the Mouth of <HI>Clyde,</HI> is a Haven for Ve&s;&s;els of the greate&s;t Size. The City it &s;elf is joined to the Suburbs, which &s;tand on the We&s;t Brink, by a beautiful Bridge of Eight Arches, built of &s;quare hewen Stone.</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="19">The mo&s;t part of the City &s;tands on a Plain, and is in a Manner four-&s;quare. In the very middle of the City is the <HI>Tolbooth,</HI> magnifi|cently built of hewen Stone, with a very high Tower, and Bells which &s;ound melodiou&s;ly at every Hour's end. At the <HI>Tolbooth</HI> Four princi|pal Streets cro&s;&s;ing each other do divide the City as it were into Four equal Parts, every one of which is adorned with &s;everal publick Buildings.</P>
<P>In the higher Part of the City the Cathedral Church &s;tands, com|monly called St. <HI>Mungo</HI>'s. It amazes the Eyes of the Beholders for its &s;tupendious Bigne&s;s, and Artifice of its Structure. It con&s;i&s;ts of two Churches, of which the one is over the other. The &s;everal Rows of Pillars, and exceeding high Towers, do &s;how a wonderful piece of Ar|chitecture.</P>
<P>Near to the Church is the Archbi&s;hop's Ca&s;tle, fenced with an ex|ceeding high Wall of hewen Stone, and looks down to the City; but the chief Ornament of the City is the College which was founded by King <HI>James</HI> the II. Pope <HI>Nicholas</HI> the V. granting an Indulgence, and confirming it by his Bull to have the Rights and Liberties of a Col|lege, where general Learning &s;hould be taught. It was erected by the great Labour and Expences of that Reverend Prelate <HI>William Turn|bull</HI> Archbi&s;hop of <HI>Gla&s;gow.</HI></P>
<P>The Words of the Bull for the founding of it, are, That general Stu|dy &s;hould flouri&s;h in the &s;ame, as well in Theology, and the Canon and Civil Law, as in all other Arts and Faculties; and that the Ma&s;ters and Teachers there &s;hould enjoy all and &s;undry the Privileges, Liberties, Honours, Immunities and Exemptions which have been granted by the Apo&s;tolick See, or others, any other way, to the Ma&s;ters, Teachers, or Students of our College at <HI>Bononia.</HI> The Fabrick of the College is remarkable, con&s;i&s;ting of divers Courts. The fore-part of it towards the City is of an excellent Structure being of hewen Stone. The Pre|cincts of the College are enlarged by &s;ome Acres of Ground, purcha|&s;ed by &s;ome Money granted to it of late by the King and E&s;tates of the Kingdom. It is &s;eparated from the re&s;t of the Town by an ex|ceeding high Wall.</P>

<P>The River is remarkable for the Multitude of Salmon and Perches which are taken in it. About half a Mile from Old <HI>Aberdeen</HI> it hath a Bridge of one &s;ingle Arch, which is both large and &s;tately, it is made up for the mo&s;t part of &s;quare hewen Stone, both the Ends of it being fixed on Rocks. By its crooked winding it breaks the force of the Stream, &s;o that Nature it &s;elf &s;eems to have made way for its Situa|tion. A little below it <HI>Don</HI> enters into the Sea.</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="21">Above the Bridge two Miles, is a heap of Stone artificially ca&s;t in the Mouth of the Chanal for the ea&s;ier catching of the Salmon.

'Tis In|feriour to no College in <HI>Scotland.</HI> One &s;ide of it is covered with Slate, the re&s;t with Lead; the Church, and Turret or Steeple are of hewen Stone. The Windows were of old remarkable for painted Gla&s;s, and &s;ome reliques of their ancient Splendor do yet remain. Here is a fine Monument of Bi&s;hop <HI>Elphing&s;ton.</HI> The Steeple be&s;ides others hath two Bells of an extraordinary Bigne&s;s. The Top of it is vaulted with a double cro&s;s Arch, above which is a King's Crown, having eight Corners upheld by as many Pillars of Stone, a round Globe of Stone with two gilded Cro&s;&s;es clo&s;ing the Crown. In the Year 1631 it was overturned by a Storm, but &s;hortly after was built in a more &s;tately Form. It was begun by Bi&s;hop <HI>Forbes,</HI> continued by <HI>William Gourdon</HI> Dr. of Phy&s;ick, and helped on by the large&s;&s;es of &s;everal Noblemen and Gentlemen of that Country.

A Man as con&s;iderable for the publick Works which he erected, as for the Lands which he po&s;&s;e&s;s'd, and the Ho|nours which were conferred upon him by &s;everal of the greate&s;t Princes of <HI>Europe.</HI> It is remarkable that in all this Work there are not two Cuts of one &s;ort. The mo&s;t curious Part of the Building is the Vault of the Quire, and that which is called the Prince's Pillar &s;o much talk'd of. This Chapel was po&s;&s;e&s;s'd by a Provo&s;t, and Seven Canons Regular, who were endued with &s;everal con&s;iderable Revenues through the Liberality of the Lairds of <HI>Ro&s;lin.</HI></P>
<P>Here lies buried <HI>George</HI> Earl of <HI>Caithne&s;s,</HI> who lived about the Begin|ning of the Reformation, <HI>Alexander</HI> Earl of <HI>Sutherland,</HI> great Grand-Child to King <HI>Robert de Bruce,</HI> Three Earls of <HI>Orkney,</HI> and Nine Barons of <HI>Ro&s;lin.</HI></P>
<P>The la&s;t lay in a Vault, &s;o dry that their Bodies have been found in|tire after Four&s;core Years, and as fre&s;h as when they were fir&s;t buried. There goes a Tradition, That before the Death of any of the Family of <HI>Ro&s;lin,</HI> this Chapel appears all in Fire.</P>

<P>A Mona&s;tery in the Barony of <HI>Ranfrew,</HI> founded by the Steward of <HI>Scotland,</HI> in the Year 1160. The Monks of <HI>Clugny</HI> were the fir&s;t Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors thereof, then the <HI>Ci&s;tercians,</HI> and after that the Monks of <HI>Clugny</HI> a &s;econd time, who were religious Per&s;ons of the Order of St. <HI>Bennet,</HI> but reformed by <HI>Odo</HI> Abbot of <HI>Clugny</HI> in <HI>Burgundy,</HI> from whence they had their Name.</P>
<P>The Monks of this Place wrote a Hi&s;tory of this Nation, commonly called <HI>The Black Book of</HI> Pa&s;ley. At the Reformation it was be&s;towed on the Duke of <HI>Chatterault.</HI> Sir <HI>Robert Spot&s;wood</HI> had this Book in his Library, and after his Murder General <HI>Lambert</HI> got it, and brought it to <HI>England.</HI></P>

<P>IS a little <HI>I&s;land</HI> within the <HI>Forth,</HI> about a Mile di&s;tant from the South Shore. The Pro&s;pects of it &s;ufficiently te&s;tifie how difficult the Acce&s;s to it is.</P>
<P>Upon the Top of this I&s;land there is a Spring, which &s;ufficiently furni&s;hes the Garri&s;on with Water; and there is Pa&s;turage for Twenty or Thirty Sheep.</P>
<P>'Tis al&s;o famous for the great Flocks of Fowls, which re&s;ort thither in the Months of <HI>May</HI> and <HI>June,</HI> the Surface of it being almo&s;t covered with their Ne&s;ts, Eggs and young Birds. The mo&s;t delicious among&s;t the&s;e different Sorts of wild Fowl, is the <HI>Soaling Goo&s;e,</HI> and the <HI>Kittie Waicke.</HI> There is only one I&s;land more in the We&s;t of <HI>Scotland,</HI> called <HI>Ail&s;ey,</HI> where the&s;e Gee&s;e do breed; and from the&s;e two Places the Country is furni&s;hed with them, during the Months of <HI>July</HI> and <HI>Augu&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>This I&s;land of the <HI>Ba&s;&s;e</HI> was an old Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Family of <HI>Lau|der,</HI> and in King <HI>Charles</HI> II's Reign it was bought and annexed to the Crown.</P>
