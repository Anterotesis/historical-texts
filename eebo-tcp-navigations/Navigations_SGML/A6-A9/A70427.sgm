<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>SOme Readers may imagine that it is no hard matter to de&s;cribe a Country &s;o near, &s;o full of Learned men and &s;o &s;tor'd with excellent Books as <HI>France</HI> is, e&s;pe|cially for a Native of it, becau&s;e of the many helps an Author may meet with. I have made u&s;e of all tho&s;e I could come at, Books, Maps, Memoirs, Inquiries of living per&s;ons, be&s;ides what I knew of my own. But I was &s;oon aware, that the De&s;cription of tho&s;e who have Written before me, even in the middle of that Kingdom, are very imperfect. All the Journeys into <HI>France</HI> I have read, as <HI>du Verdier, Sinceri Accii Itinerarium Galliae, Le Grand Tour de France, les Delices de la France,</HI> and the late <HI>Voyages Hi&s;toriques de l'Eu|rope</HI> ob&s;erve neither order nor method, confound|ing not only the &s;everal Counties into which each great Government is &s;ubdivided, but even the great Governments them&s;elves. As to Geographers <HI>Comminges</HI> and <HI>Darity</HI> are too old and confus'd. The Maps of <HI>San&s;on</HI> the Father and the Son, are excellent, tho&s;e
<PB REF="5"> of <HI>Du Val</HI> next to them, and by compar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ng them together, as I have done, one may be pretty &s;ure of the Longitude and Latitude, &s;ituation and di&s;tance of places. But neither of the <HI>San&s;ons</HI> has made a modern and particular De&s;cription of <HI>France,</HI> and that of <HI>Du Val</HI> is too &s;hort and not methodical enough. As to Anti|quities. <HI>Andre du Che&s;ne</HI> in his curious Inqui|ries concerning the Towns of <HI>France</HI> is full of Fables, and ought not to be follow'd but very cautiou&s;ly, tho he is a Man of a va&s;t reading and much to be commended for having pu|bli&s;hed &s;everal Hi&s;torians of the middle Age that have Written of the <HI>French</HI> affairs, and made u&s;e of them in his Antiquities of that Country and Monarchy. <HI>Jo&s;eph Scaliger,</HI> how Learned &s;oever he may be in other things, does not come near <HI>Du Che&s;ne</HI> in this, and propo&s;es many bold conjectures, concerning the ancient names of the <HI>French</HI> Cities and Countries, for which he often gives no other authority but his bare &s;aying. <HI>Baudrand</HI> is but a pitiful compiler of modern Books, who never look'd into ancient Authors. <HI>San&s;on</HI> in his <HI>Pharus Galliae Antiquae</HI> is more accurate than the fore men|tioned Writers, and has made many curious and u&s;eful di&s;coveries. But the mo&s;t exact of all in my Judgment is <HI>Adrian de Valois</HI> in his <HI>Notitia Galliarum,</HI> as to the <HI>Latin</HI> names of Places, for there is hardly any thing el&s;e in that huge <HI>Folio,</HI> be&s;ides &s;ome few hints of Hi&s;tory to be g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ther'd here and there with great trouble.</P>
<P>I have perus'd three other modern Geogra|phers which I mu&s;t not forget, <HI>viz. Robbe</HI>'s <HI>Memoires Geographiques, Morery</HI>'s <HI>Grand Diction|naire
<PB REF="5"> Hi&s;torique and Geographique,</HI> with the &s;up|plement of <HI>Perayre,</HI> and <HI>De la Croix</HI>'s <HI>Geographie &V;niver&s;elle.</HI> As to the fir&s;t, he cannot commit many faults, for he has almo&s;t nothing be&s;ides <HI>French</HI> names; but as &s;oon as he pre&s;umes to &s;ay &s;omething more, for in&s;tance to determine the extent of a Government or its Latitude and Longitude, one may very near be &s;ure to find him in an error. As to <HI>Morery,</HI> it is pity he did not live long enough, or had not the conveniency to read ancient Authors. His want of Learning in Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Hi&s;tory and My&s;teries of State makes him too pa&s;&s;ionate, when he &s;peaks of the <HI>Prote&s;tants,</HI> and leads him into many mi&s;takes as to <HI>Latin</HI> names and other Antiquities. As to <HI>De la Croix,</HI> all his performance con&s;i&s;ts in ha|ving put an ab<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">idgment of <HI>Morery</HI> into <HI>Rob<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">e</HI>'s method, and a very unjudicious one too, for he leaves out what is mo&s;t curious and e&s;&s;ential in the Great Dictionary; and the re&s;t he takes it word for word, unle&s;s it be to corrupt and abridg it again, but for the mo&s;t part he is &s;o faithful as to tran&s;cribe the very faults of the pre&s;s, as p. 200. l. 29. <HI>Anvers</HI> for <HI>An<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">t.</HI> Whatever he adds of his own here and there, as the Latitude and Longitude and the di&s;tance of places is always fal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">e, for he never took the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 word"> of looking into one of <HI>San&s;on</HI>'s or <HI>du Val</HI>'s Ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">s. For in&s;tance, p. 201 he &s;ays that, <HI>No-gent-le-Roy is &s;ituated on the River Eure,</HI> be|twixt <HI>Dreux and Chartres,</HI> which is true. Then he adds <HI>Dreux or Drocum is upon the Blai&s;e,</HI> &amp;c. The wor&s;t Map in the World might have &s;hewn him that tho&s;e three Towns are &s;eated on the &s;ame River. It's true <HI>More<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">y</HI> has lead
<PB REF="6"> him into that mi&s;take, but what his pardona|ble in the compiler of a great Dictionary, who is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ir<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">d out by the length and tediou&s;ne&s;s of the Work, and di&s;tracted by the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ariety of matters, is not &s;o in a Geographer. Be&s;ides that, there is a River call'd <HI>Bai&s;e</HI> in <HI>Guienne,</HI> but no River <HI>Blai&s;e</HI> in all <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P>A Vocabulary of this Authors Faults would make up a &s;mall Volume, and therefore I &s;hall only add an in&s;tance or two more. P. 309 he calls twice after <HI>Robbe, Briancon</HI> a Bi&s;hoprick Neither <HI>Morery</HI> nor any other Author that I know of mentions any &s;uch thing: For the <HI>Brianconnois</HI> were ever as they are &s;till a de|pendency of the <HI>Caturiges</HI> and the Prelate of <HI>Ambrun.</HI> P. 320. He puts after <HI>Robbe, Serres</HI> in <HI>Viennois,</HI> that is in the Northern part of <HI>Dauphin&eacute;,</HI> tho it lies in <HI>Gapencois</HI> or in the South of that Province. This as true as what he &s;ays p. 17 that, at the beginning of this War, <HI>the French King put</HI> 700000 <HI>Men in Arms;</HI> and that <HI>he alone has more Religion, Merit, Glory, Revenus and Soldiers, then all the Crown'd Heads of Europe together,</HI> without excepting his dear Ally the Turk.</P>
<P>The former De&s;cription of <HI>France</HI> being &s;o faulty, I let the Reader judg what trouble I have been at in chu&s;ing the be&s;t, and including what ever &s;eem'd to me mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential in the Compa&s;s of this Book. It is divided into two parts, whereof the fir&s;t is an introduction to the Second, a general &s;urvey of the whole Country, and an explication of &s;everal Offices and terms that can &s;carce be fully unde<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;tood without it.

<PB REF="6"> you will find there &s;everal things concerning the <HI>French</HI> Monarchy and Politicks, the power of their Parliaments, the &s;tate of their Nobility and Gentry, the increa&s;e of Popery, the breaking up of the Reformation, the cau&s;es that retarded its progre&s;s, and have altogether eclips'd it in that Kingdom; all which is not ea&s;ily to be met with any where-el&s;e. The &s;econd contains an Hi&s;torical and Geographical De&s;crip|tion of the twelve Great Governments, into which <HI>France</HI> u&s;es to be divided, be&s;ides <HI>Lor|raine</HI> and the County of <HI>Burgundy.</HI> There I treat of the different Revolutions of Each Go|vernment, of its ancient Inhabitants, of its <HI>Gauli&s;h</HI> and <HI>Latin</HI> names and other Antiquities, of its borders, extent, &s;ubdivi&s;ions, Air, Cli|mate, Fertility, Rivers, Lakes, Mountains, natural Curio&s;ities, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> I &s;et down the di|&s;tance of the Capital Cities from <HI>Paris</HI> or from each other, and of the mo&s;t con&s;iderable Towns in each Government from their Capital, their <HI>Latin</HI> names, Antiquities, Lords and Titles, their Civil and Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Government, with the &s;everal Changes they have undergone, their mo&s;t remarkable Buildings, Trade, Inhabitants, the Great Men they have produc'd, their Soyl and Territory, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>

<P><HI>FRANCE</HI> has not changed her ancient Limits to the South, We&s;t and North; &s;eeing, as <HI>Gallia</HI> of old, it has to the We&s;t, the Ocean of <HI>Aquitain;</HI> to the North, the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Ocean as far as <HI>Calis,</HI> by which Sea it is divided from <HI>England;</HI> the <HI>Mediterranean</HI> Sea on the South, which is al&s;o called the <HI>French</HI> Sea, with the <HI>Pyrenaean</HI> Mountains that part her from <HI>Spain.</HI></P>
<P>As to her Limits on the <HI>East</HI> and <HI>North-East,</HI> they are very uncertain, e&s;pecially in this time of War: Before the late Conque&s;ts, it was bounded by the County of <HI>Burgundy Elzas,</HI> the Dukedom of <HI>Lorrain</HI> and <HI>Barrois,</HI> and part of the <HI>Spani&s;h Netherlands; viz.</HI> the Province of <HI>Luxembourg, Hainault, Bra|bant,</HI> and <HI>Flanders,</HI> But at pre&s;ent the <HI>French</HI> King is Ma&s;ter of all tho&s;e Countries, except of a little part: So that his Kingdom has al|mo&s;t recover'd its ancient Limits on that &s;ide <HI>viz.</HI> the <HI>Rhine</HI> and the Mouth of the <HI>Meu&s;e.</HI></P>

<P>The ancient <HI>Galli,</HI> called <HI>Celtae,</HI> tran&s;plant|ed them&s;elves into <HI>A&s;ia,</HI> where they gave their Name to a whole Country, called <HI>Ga|latia, Gallo-Graecia,</HI> or <HI>Gallia Minor,</HI> and now <HI>Chiangare,</HI> being part of <HI>Natoly,</HI> or <HI>Le&s;s A&s;ia.</HI> Another Colony of the <HI>Gallick Nation</HI> having pa&s;&s;ed the <HI>Alpes,</HI> conquered a good part of <HI>Italy,</HI> which made the <HI>Romans</HI> to di|&s;tingui&s;h them into <HI>Ci&s;alpins</HI> and <HI>Tran&s;alpins.</HI> However, the Country on this &s;ide the <HI>Alpes</HI> retained the ancient Name of <HI>Gallia;</HI> and falling afterwards under the Power of the <HI>Romans,</HI> was divided by <HI>Augu&s;tus</HI> into four Parts, <HI>viz. Gallia Narbonen&s;is,</HI> called al&s;o <HI>Gallia Braccata,</HI> becau&s;e of the <HI>Braccae,</HI> a kind of broad long Coats the Inhabitants wore.

<P><HI>Aquitain</HI> at <HI>Julius Cae&s;ar</HI>'s time was com|prehended between the River <HI>Garumn,</HI> the Sea, and the <HI>Pyrenaean</HI> Mountains; but was afterwards extended by <HI>Augu&s;tus</HI> as far as the River <HI>Loire</HI> on the North, and the Mountains of the <HI>Cevennes</HI> on the Ea&s;t, and &s;ubdivided into fir&s;t, &s;econd and third <HI>Aqui|tain.</HI> Its ancient Inhabitants had &s;everal

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. III.</HI> Of the Inhabitants of <HI>France,</HI> and of their Language.</HEAD>
<P>THE French are Endowed with more Virtuos than Vices, by the Confe&s;&s;ion even of Strangers, who prai&s;e them for their Charity, ho&s;pitality, Courte&s;ie, Valour, and Bravery; and for their being fit, and as 'twere, born to all that they are minded to Undertake in Learning, War, or Mecha|nicks; wherein they very Expeditiou&s;ly imi|tate whatever they &s;ee perform'd by Stran|gers. They are very cleanly in their Diet and Apparel, and very apt in the one or the other to go beyond their Means, Quality, and Birth; which, by comparing them to Spaniards, Italians, and other Nations, has been taken notice of. Their Cloathing, as to the Making, is never certain, no more as to the Mode then as to the Stuff, wherein continually they change, at lea&s;t from year to year.</P>
<P>The Men here are Comelier and Stronger, and of a finer &s;ize than Spaniards and Italians, but not then the Germans, Dutch, or Eng|li&s;h. As to the Women, they are Hand|&s;omer In &s;ome Provinces than others; For in <HI>Normandy, Picardy,</HI> and on this &s;ide the <HI>Loire,</HI> they are commonly more agreeable
<PB N="16" REF="15"> than in the ancient <HI>Aquitain;</HI> that is, in <HI>Auvergne, Perigord,</HI> the Country of <HI>Limoges, Ga&s;cony,</HI> and <HI>&V;pper Languedoc.</HI> The other part of <HI>Guienne,</HI> e&s;pecially at <HI>Bourdeaux,</HI> part of <HI>Dauphin&eacute;, Lower Languedoc,</HI> and <HI>Provence,</HI> &s;hew more plea&s;ing Faces, and even exqui&s;ite Beauties: As we have &s;aid that the French Man renders him&s;elf fit for every Thing, he is chiefly &s;o in Arms and War-fare: He likewi&s;e gives him&s;elf over to Study, Eloquence, to all Arts, and to Merchandize: He carries freely his Trade to Foreign Nations, and there Manures the Land, and knows not to be Lazy: He is very Indu&s;trious, and Works merrily, though he is found fault with for not being Patient and willing to endure in War. The French Nobility are above all mo&s;t rare Hor&s;emen, and have a particular Care of their Honour, even to exce&s;s: witne&s;s, the damnable cu&s;tom of Duels, which the Edicts of the pre&s;ent Prince have not yet been able totally to &s;uppre&s;s. The People of <HI>France</HI> are generally Meek and Good every where, except in &s;ome few places, where they are a little too Blunt and Ru&s;tick. The Vulgar bears an extream Re&s;pect to great Per&s;ons, whether they be of the Nobility, Officers of Ju&s;tice, or of the Revenues. Eccle&s;ia&s;ticks, and other Men of Long Gown, are e&s;pecially Honoured; And there is hardly any Nation in the World that has &s;o many Officers of all &s;orts
<PB N="17" REF="15"> as the Kingdom of <HI>France.</HI> The Merchant, nay, and the very Trade&s;man, if at any time he becomes Wealthy, pu&s;hes his Children to it: And into &s;everal Parliaments of <HI>France,</HI> and other Courts of Ju&s;tice, the Nobility Sues for Offices too; whence comes that in|finite number of literate Men, though their Reward be but &s;mall, and that all Offices be Sold; which is not u&s;ual in other States of <HI>Europe.</HI> Thence al&s;o proceeds a &s;warm of Advocates, Sollicitors, Regi&s;ters, Notaries, and other Men of Bu&s;ine&s;s, who&s;e number has been extraordinarily increas'd by the late Edicts of <HI>Lewis</HI> XIV, and his Creation for Money of an incredible number of new Officers, which mu&s;t needs impoveri&s;h the Kingdom, and bring it at la&s;t to an utter Ruin. For either the&s;e new Offices will be &s;uppre&s;s'd in time of Peace, and con&s;equent|ly a great many Families will be Ruin'd that have be&s;tow'd their ready Money, and &s;ome their E&s;tates upon the&s;e Employments: Or, if they be continued, the common Peo|ple will be oppre&s;s'd by the multitude of Officers, and the number of Merchants, Trades and Husbandmen mightily dimi|ni&s;h'd.</P>
<P>Another great Abu&s;e that may prove at la&s;t the Ruin of <HI>France,</HI> is the extraordi|nary increa&s;e of the Gentry; For whereas in <HI>England,</HI> younger Brothers even of the greate&s;t Noblemen make no difficulty of
<PB N="18" REF="16"> becoming Merchants, nay and Trade&s;men too, if they have no inclination to Learn|ing: The younge&s;t Son of a &s;imple Gen|tleman in <HI>France</HI> would account it a great Di&s;honour to his Birth to do any thing but to wear a Gown, or a Sword; which makes that the French Gentry, who is almo&s;t as numerous as the other Inhabitants, can hard|ly &s;ub&s;i&s;t in time of Peace.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the Faults which the French have common, with other Nations, as to be too much given to Play, to Women, Debau|chery, Bla&s;phemies, and Cur&s;ings, it cannot be deny'd but that they are Ha&s;ty and Cho|lerick; However you will find among&s;t 'em very few in&s;tances of tho&s;e &s;ecret and awful Revenges that are &s;o often practis'd by &s;ome of their Neighbours. As to their Levity, we may in their behalf make u&s;e of <HI>Charles</HI> the Fifth's &s;aying, <HI>That they are Wi&s;e with|out making any &s;hew of it:</HI> For though they are not &s;o Crafty as the Italians, nor &s;o Vain and Proud as the Spaniards, yet do they not want Policy and Cunning. Finally the French are very Religious, and have al|ways feared their Gods; and whatever Re|ligion they Embraced, they firmly &s;tick'd to it. The frequent Wars which they have Undertaken or Suffered upon this account, &s;hew the Truth of this A&s;&s;ertion. They are very Re&s;pectful to Ladies, and give them large Liberty; neither do they &s;hut them
<PB N="19" REF="16"> up as the Italians and Spaniards do; whence it comes that they are cordially Beloved and &s;erved by their Wives; and that the Vi&s;its and Practi&s;es of young Women end generally in a happy Wedlock.</P>
<P>The French Tongue for the mo&s;t part is a Branch of the Latin: The Romans be|coming Ma&s;ters of the Country, and intro|ducing their Laws in it, changed the Speech of the Natural Inhabitants, or by little and lit|tle made them loo&s;e it. If the German Tongue had been there &s;poken before, or the Bri|ti&s;h, they were at la&s;t totally routed, and a kind of corrupted Latin took their place. Now a days each Province has its peculiar manner of Speaking and Dialect; However there is &s;till a difference of Speech betwixt the Provinces on this &s;ide the <HI>Loire,</HI> and tho&s;e beyond it: The fir&s;t Speak French, and the la&s;t Ga&s;con, taking this Word as u&s;ually taken at <HI>Paris;</HI> for tho&s;e of <HI>Languedoc</HI> and <HI>Dauphin&eacute;, Provence,</HI> and <HI>Guyenne,</HI> the Latin Tongue having left deeper Foot&s;teps of its Re&s;idence in tho&s;e four Provinces than a|mong the other French, who&s;e Language is purer, e&s;pecially about <HI>Blois, Orleance,</HI> and <HI>Paris.</HI></P>

The Reve|nues of the Kingdom before the Dutch War of 1672, were deem'd to amount to 170000000 Livres, that is, about 15000000 Sterling, but have ever &s;ince &s;till dimini&s;h'd, partly by the continual Taxes that impove|ri&s;h the People, and partly by the &s;top which the Wars have put to Trade; but much more by the Per&s;ecution of the Prote&s;tants, which has made the price of the Lands con|&s;iderably fall, di&s;turb'd the Traffick of the Realm, and depriv'd it of great Sums of ready Money, which the French Refugees have brought over with 'em into Foreign Coun|tries.</P>
<P>The French Monarchy &s;trove many Ages before it came to that high Point of Gran|deur to which it has attained of late. The
<PB N="21" REF="17"> Weakne&s;s of <HI>Charlemaign</HI>'s Succe&s;&s;ors, and the Incur&s;ions of the <HI>Normans,</HI> had reduced it to &s;o narrow Limits, that the French King was hardly Sovereign in <HI>Paris.</HI> The Go|vernors of the &s;everal Counties and Provinces taking hold of the occa&s;ion, made their Charges Hereditary; and &s;oon after ren|der'd them&s;elves Lords of the Countries they Govern'd: So that <HI>France</HI> at that time was rather an <HI>Ari&s;tocracy,</HI> or a Confederacy of &s;everal Petty-Princes under the French King their Head, as <HI>Germany</HI> now is under the Emperor, then a Monarchy properly &s;o call'd. But the Victories which <HI>Charles</HI> VII got over the Engli&s;h in the Fifteenth Age, during the Wars of the Hou&s;es of <HI>York</HI> and <HI>Lanca&s;ter,</HI> gave him means to Unite to his Crown the large Provinces of <HI>Guyenne</HI> and <HI>Normandy;</HI> together with <HI>Poictou, le Maine,</HI> and <HI>Tourain.

<P>The Authority of the <HI>French</HI> Monarchs grew &s;tronger and more ab&s;olute within their Kingdom, as the Bounds of it were extended without; at lea&s;t in this latter Age. For in former times, even that mighty Em|peror <HI>Charlemaign</HI> would do nothing without the Advice of his Barons; no, not &s;o much as e&s;tabli&s;h and endow a Bi&s;hoprick: and by their means it was, that his Son, <HI>Lewis the Pious,</HI> was re-inthron'd. The Power of the <HI>French</HI> Lords la&s;ted not only under the Se|cond
<PB N="23" REF="18"> Race, but three or four Ages too under the Third. And as the&s;e petty Princes were extingui&s;hed, their Authority was transferr'd to the States of the &s;everal Provinces, under who&s;e hands it remained, till the Civil Wars, under the pretence of Religion, gave a mighty check to it; and the &s;hrewd Policy of the Cardinals <HI>Richelieu</HI> and <HI>Mazarine</HI> made it altogether arbitrary.</P>
<P>Now the French Kings pretend that they are Emperors in <HI>France,</HI> as <HI>Bodin</HI> and <HI>du Tillet</HI> have endeavoured to prove; That their Authority is Ab&s;olute and Sove|reign, and that as to the Temporal they have no other Superior than God alone, up|on whom their Crown immediately depends, it not being in the Power of the Prelates of their Kingdom either to excommunicate them, or to publi&s;h them to be &s;uch. By rea&s;on of their Con&s;ecration, they are look'd upon to be of the Body of &s;everal Cathedral Churches in <HI>France,</HI> where they hold the Prebends.

<P>THE greate&s;t Office of the King's Hou&s;e, is that of Grand Ma&s;ter of his Hou&s;e, before whom, all the Officers that &s;erve therein take the Oaths, and whom they are to obey. There is a Chief Steward of the Hou&s;ehold, and a Steward of the Hou&s;e|hold in Ordinary, and others that &s;erve quarterly, having a Stick in their Hands, &s;et in Silver gilt at both Ends. They precede the Serving Gentlemen, when the Kings Meat goes by.</P>
<P>There is a Grand Provo&s;t of <HI>France,</HI> or Provo&s;t of the Hou&s;hold, which is a very ancient and authorized Office: Ju&s;tice is exerci&s;ed, under his Name, by two Lieu|tenants, the one in a long, and the other in a &s;hort Gown, by Serjeants, and by fifty Archers, cloathed in <HI>Hoquetons</HI> or Ca&s;&s;ocks of Livery, that follow him, attend the Court,

<P>The Place of great Chamberlain is al&s;o very ancient, honourable and priviledged. He is Superintendant of the King's Cham|ber, of his Cloathings and Moveables. He lyes at the King's Feet, when he holds his Bed of Ju&s;tice, or at the General States of the Kingdom, when the Kings u&s;ed to call them.</P>
<P>There are four Chief Gentlemen of the King's Chamber that &s;erve quarterly, a Ma|&s;ter of the Wardrobe, a Ma&s;ter of the Ceremonies, a Leader of Amba&s;&s;adors, who all take the Oaths in the King's Hands.</P>
<P>There was formerly a <HI>Grand Queux,</HI> or a Great Ma&s;ter of the King's Kitchin; but this Charge is now aboli&s;hed, there having been none &s;ince <HI>Lewis</HI> of <HI>Prie,</HI> Lord of <HI>Bu|zanco<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="2 letters"></HI> who died under <HI>Charles</HI> VIII. <HI>An.</HI> 1490.

They or|dinarily wear a Stick, as a Badge of their Dignity, and when they receive it from the King, they take the Oath of Allegiance to him, in the High Court of Parliament at <HI>Paris.</HI> The Seat of their Juri&s;diction is at the Marble-Table in the Palace of that Court, where their Power is very con&s;ide|rable, &s;ince the Suppre&s;&s;ion of the Charge of Lord Con&s;table, upon whom they were formerly depending. However, this Pow|er is &s;omewhat counterballanced by their great Increa&s;e in Number of late years.</P>
<P>The Lord Chancellor is the Head of all the Courts of Ju&s;tice, and pre&s;ides in all

And therefore the Kings, to keep this great Mini&s;ter in awe, have a Lord Keeper of the Seals, whom they cau&s;e to di&s;charge the Chancellor's Functions, by giving him the Seals; in which Occa&s;ion, the Chancellor retains no more but the bare Name of his Office. He has under him the Ma&s;ters of the Reque&s;ts, who &s;erve quarterly, judge the Differences between the Officers of the Crown, and pre|pare &s;uch Matters as are to come before the King's Great Council.</P>
<P>This Council is now a Soveraign Court of Ju&s;tice, who&s;e Sentences are executed throughout the whole Kingdom; it's com|po&s;ed of the Chancellor and eight Ma&s;ters of Reque&s;ts.

There are al&s;o a Council of State, a Coun|cil of the Exchequer, a Privy-Council, to de|termine Appeals and Conte&s;ts about the Ju|ri&s;diction of Judges, and the Cabinet Coun|cil, who manages all the Affairs, and is as the Soul of the Realm.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the twelve ancient Peers of <HI>France,</HI> there are near a hundred more created &s;ince two or three Centuries; but though they have the Priviledge to &s;it in the Parlia|ment at <HI>Paris,</HI> and not to be judged by any other Court, yet they fall &s;hort of

By whom&s;oever the Chri&s;tian Religion has been fir&s;t preached in <HI>France,</HI> &s;ure it is, that it was early enough, &s;ince in the middle of the &s;econd Century, there were two con|&s;picuous Churches at <HI>Lyons</HI> and <HI>Vienne,</HI> who endured a long and bloody Per&s;e|cution,

By what Means and Degrees Popery corrupted Chri&s;tianity, is not a My|&s;tery in this Prote&s;tant Kingdom; but I have &s;ome Ob&s;ervations to make upon the Progre&s;s and pre&s;ent State of that Super&s;ti|tious Wor&s;hip in <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P>It's well known that Super&s;tition be|gan to creep into the Church by the over|great Honour the Faithful rendered to tho&s;e Chri&s;tian Heroes, the Martyrs, who, con|trary to the Heathen, that got a Name by their being trouble&s;ome to others, &s;ignaliz|ed them&s;elves by their own Sufferings. And with great rea&s;on were they &s;o much reve|renced, &s;ince the Pagan Antiquity, which mentions &s;o many <HI>Hercules,</HI> can hardly &s;up|ply us with an <HI>Anaxarchus.</HI> While the&s;e couragious Athletes lay in Pri&s;on, Sinners were relea&s;ed of their Penances upon their Interce&s;&s;ion; after their Death, their Tombs were the Gathering-place of the Faithful, and when God had given Peace to his Church, Temples were built upon, or near their Graves, and called after their Names. And as the Vulgar doth not know how to keep the golden middle Path, hates or loves, de&s;pi&s;es or prai&s;es to exce&s;s; So this due and lawful Remembrance &s;oon degenerated into an Idolatrous Wor&s;hip. Perhaps at the beginning it had been ea&s;ie to Clergy-Men to put a Stop to that Super&s;tition; but the
<PB N="39" REF="26"> Generality found, it &s;eems, their Reckon|ing by it, and pious Men dur&s;t not oppo&s;e the Current. However the <HI>Gauls</HI> had the Honour to produce one <HI>Jovinian,</HI> a Monk of <HI>Milan,</HI> who endured a long Per&s;ecution for openly di&s;proving the creeping Practices of Coelibacy, Vows, and the Veneration of Reliques, in the time of St. <HI>Ambro&s;e.</HI> But a greater Man than <HI>Jovinian</HI> whom neither <HI>Italians</HI> nor <HI>Spaniards</HI> can challenge, is <HI>Vi|gilantius;</HI> for he was born at <HI>Calaguri,</HI> a &s;mall Borough near <HI>Cominges</HI> in <HI>Ga&s;cony.</HI> True it is, that St. <HI>Jerom</HI> di&s;puted again&s;t him with much Violence; but the Learned know, that the Conduct of this Father is not &s;o much commended as his Science; and not|with&s;tanding his Out-crys, <HI>Vigilantius</HI> qui|etly died in the Communion of the Church, and left a great many Di&s;ciples, who &s;eem to have been the Fore-fathers of the <HI>Albi|gen&s;es;</HI> as tho&s;e of <HI>Jovinian</HI> maintained the Truth in the Churches of <HI>Italy,</HI> till <HI>Claudius,</HI> Archbi&s;hop of <HI>Turin</HI> aro&s;e, and was &s;ucceeded by the <HI>Vaudois.</HI></P>

<P>In 1633, <HI>Lewis</HI> XIII. e&s;tabli&s;hed there a Parliament, which the Commi&s;&s;ioners of the Emperour oppo&s;ed, &s;aying, <HI>That the French King was only Protector of the three Bi&s;hopricks, and not ab&s;olute Sovereign thereof; and con&s;e|quently, that he might not deprive the Inhabi|tants of their ancient Laws, and the Right they had to bring their Appeals before the Im|perial Chamber at</HI> Spire.

<P>This City has al&s;o undergone the various fate of War.

This re|fu&s;al may be reck'ned one of the chief cau&s;es of the Expul&s;ion of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> out of <HI>France,</HI> as it was the fatal period of the progre&s;s of their Arms. For as on the one hand it gave a mighty di&s;gu&s;t to this Duke, one of the mo&s;t potent Princes in <HI>Europe;</HI> &s;o on the other, the
<PB N="316" REF="165"> <HI>French</HI> were not loath to make an advantage of it. They &s;et up a young Maid, a Shepher|de&s;s of about eighteen years, who pretending a Revelation to rai&s;e the Siege of <HI>Orleans,</HI> and bring the King triumphing into <HI>Rheims,</HI> in or|der to his Coronation, &s;o encourag'd their di&s;|&s;pirited Army, and fright'nd the Enemies, that &s;he perform'd her promi&s;es; a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the Valour and Conduct of the famous Count of <HI>Dunois,</HI> but perhaps more by the jealou&s;ies rais'd between the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and the <HI>Burgundians,</HI> and then by the Civil Wars of the <HI>Engli&s;h.</HI> The Day of the Rai&s;ing of this Siege, which was the Eighth of <HI>May</HI> 1418. is &s;till kept as a Solemn Fe&s;tival in <HI>Orleans,</HI> and a Monument of this Victory has been erected on the Bridge of the City. It repre&s;ents the Bl. Virgin with our Saviour in her Arms as ready to be buried; on one &s;ide lies King <HI>Charles</HI> VII. upon his Knees, and on the other the Virgin of <HI>Orleans,</HI> (as they call her now) Booted and Spurr'd as a Trooper. This Maid was call'd <HI>Jeanne d' Arc,</HI> &s;he was a Native of <HI>Vaucouleurs</HI> in <HI>Lor|rain,</HI> but her Family being Nobilitated by the <HI>French</HI> Kings, had their Name chang'd into that of <HI>Lys, Flower de Luce,</HI> in memorial of her Ser|vices to that Crown.</P>
<P>During the Reign of <HI>Francis</HI> II. in 1560. the Duke of <HI>Gui&s;e,</HI> under the pretence of the con|&s;piracy of <HI>Amboi&s;e,</HI> di&s;arm'd the Inhabitants of <HI>Orleans,</HI> fill'd the &s;u&s;pected Hou&s;es with Soldiers, and then brought the young King, as triumphing, into the City.

<P><HI>Narbonne</HI> remained faithful to the <HI>Romans</HI> till the utmo&s;t decay of the We&s;tern Empire, in 435, that it was be&s;ieg'd by the <HI>Goths,</HI> under their King <HI>Theodoric.</HI> It then made a con&s;ide|rable re&s;i&s;tance; but in 462.

<P>The mo&s;t remarkable remains of Antiquity in <HI>Ni&s;mes</HI> are its Amphitheatre, the Square-hou&s;e, or <HI>Mai&s;on quarr&eacute;e,</HI> the great Tower or <HI>Tourre-magne,</HI> the Fountain <HI>Nemau&s;us,</HI> and the Temple near this Fountain.</P>

Notwith|&s;tanding one may &s;till di&s;cern the Figures of <HI>Remus</HI> and <HI>Romulus</HI> &s;uckling a She-wolf, the Vultures that appeared to the&s;e Founders of <HI>Rome,</HI> two Bull-heads upon the ancient Gate of this Building, and two Towers upon the new Gate. The Seats whence the Spectators &s;aw the Shews have been remov'd from thence, and the Caves where the wild Bea&s;ts were kept are now fill'd up with Earth. Nay the whole capacity of the Amphitheatre is taken up with Hou&s;es, at lea&s;t &s;ince the year 1179; as may be prov'd by Patentees granted by the Vi&s;count <HI>Bernard Atten,</HI> where the Inhabitants of <HI>Ni&s;mes</HI> and tho&s;e of the <HI>Arenes</HI> are di&s;tingui&s;h'd; which &s;hews, that this City has not been rebuilt where it formerly &s;tood; for anciently the Amphi|theatre was without the Town, and Warriors have oft made u&s;e of it, as of a Fort or Cit|tadel.</P>
<P>The Square-hou&s;e, <HI>La Mai&s;on quarr&eacute;e,</HI> is a kind of <HI>Parellelogramme,</HI> or long Square, be|ing 74 Foot in length, and 41 Foot 6 Inches in breadth. Its front is adorned with 6 Co|lumns, and each &s;ide with ten. The top is flat and cover'd with &s;quare Free-&s;tones extra|ordinary large, &s;o that one may walk upon it without any danger. As we do not know who
<PB N="555" REF="253"> rais'd the Amphitheatre, we are not better ac|quainted with the Founder of this Hou&s;e, nor to what u&s;e it was fitted.

<P>Without the Walls of the City upon the top of a high Hill, ri&s;es an antient Building, call'd by the Inhabitants <HI>Tourre-Magne,</HI> the great Tower, becau&s;e of its prodigious height, or that it exceeded by far all the Towers round about. For by the remains it &s;eems to have been a Watch or Tower, built in the form of a Pyra|mide at one of the Corners of its antient Walls. One may &s;till di&s;tingui&s;h the Stairs, whereupon they a&s;cended to the top, and the Niches or Ca&s;e-frames, wherein they plac'd the Statues of their Gods. The whole Fabrick is of &s;mall &s;quare Stones, &s;o well cemented together, that the mo&s;t indu&s;trious Ma&s;on &s;hould not throw down two Foot of it in a day.</P>
<P>At the Foot of that Hill &s;prings a mo&s;t clear and plea&s;ant Fountain, in the form of a Pond, with a Whirl-pool in the middle, wherein, if any Creature chance to fall, it is never to be &s;een again.

<P>Near this Fountain is an old Square-Temple, under-propt by two rows of Columns with their Bars, Chapters, Architraves, Frizes, Cor|ni&s;hes and Mouldings, all in a ju&s;t proportion, together with Niches or Ca&s;e-frames, and round Windows in the Walls, for the Statues of their Gods, and Eagles of embo&s;s'd Work, who&s;e Heads have been broken off by the barbarous <HI>Goths, Huns,</HI> or <HI>Saracens</HI> in contempt of the <HI>Romans.</HI> This Temple has been turned into a Mona&s;tery of Nuns; and becau&s;e of the Eagles and other marks of its former magnificence, I &s;hould be apt to take it for the <HI>Ba&s;ilick</HI> of <HI>A|drien,</HI> rather than the Square-hou&s;e, or any o|ther antient Building.</P>
