<HEAD>INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P>THE following Relations di&s;covering <HI>&s;ome</HI> of
the riche&s;t Parts of the World, not yet
planted by the Europeans, and <HI>others</HI> but
little known, worthy the peru&s;al of the Curi|ous,
can hardly fail of a favourable Reception at this
Juncture; for of all the Ble&s;&s;ings of Peace, none
appear more charming or profitable than Navigation
and Commerce, e&s;pecially to the <HI>Engli&s;h Nation,</HI>
who&s;e Genius is much bent upon Improvements at Sea,
and Plantations abroad, which bring great Riches
into the Kingdom, particularly tho&s;e in <HI>America,</HI>
where the Spaniards by their ill Conduct have given
Opportunities to &s;ome of their Neighbours to put in for
a &s;hare of the Wealth and Trade of that va&s;t Tract
of Land.</P>
<P>The frequent Sacking of their Towns and &s;eizing
of their Ships by the <HI>Engli&s;h, French,</HI> and <HI>Dutch,</HI>
put <HI>Philip the Third</HI> upon &s;earching out new ways
of tran&s;porting the Trea&s;ures of <HI>Peru, Chili,</HI> and
<HI>Granada</HI> into <HI>Spain;</HI> to which end (the Coa&s;ts about,
and in the Gulph of <HI>Mexico</HI> being as well known as
tho&s;e in <HI>Europe</HI>) Orders were di&s;patched from the
Court at <HI>Madrid</HI> to the Governours of <HI>Brazil</HI> and
<HI>Peru</HI> to attempt the Navigation of the great River of
AMAZONS, that if 'twere found practicable,
the <HI>Gold, Silver,</HI> and other Merchandizes of <HI>Pe|ru</HI>
and the adjacent Countries might be &s;afely and
commodiou&s;ly &s;ent down to <HI>Para</HI> to be put on board
the Galleons, which would lie le&s;s expos'd there, than
at <HI>Cartagena, Porto Belo,</HI> or <HI>Vera Cruz,</HI> the
Soundings of the Mouth of that River being un|known,
and dangerous to Strangers. What E&s;&s;ays
<PB N="iv" REF="3">
were made pur&s;uant to the&s;e In&s;tructions, is be&s;t &s;een
by the fir&s;t Chapters of the en&s;uing Relation of <HI>F.
Chr. d' Acugna,</HI> to which the Reader is referr'd,
as the true Journal of the only Voyage upon, and

<P><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Nat. Sotvelli Bibliothec. Scriptor. Societ. Je&s;u. Romae, 1677. Fol.</NOTE> <HI>Chri&s;topher d' Acugna</HI> was born at <HI>Burgos</HI> in
<HI>Spain, Anno</HI> 1597. and entred into the Society of
Je&s;us at 15 Years of Age. After &s;ome Years &s;pent
in Study, he went into <HI>America,</HI> and was Rector of
the Je&s;uits College at <HI>Cuence</HI> under the Juri&s;diction
of <HI>Quito,</HI> when <HI>Peter Texeira</HI> the Portuguez Gene|ral
came thither from <HI>Para</HI> in <HI>Brazil</HI> up the River of
<HI>Amazons.</HI> The Viceroy of <HI>Peru</HI> ordered our Author
to embark with <HI>Texeira</HI> (who return'd by the &s;ame

of the Artillery, pre&s;ented to <HI>Mazarine</HI> Propo&s;als for
conquering and planting this great River; but the
<HI>Cardinal</HI> being involv'd in Dome&s;tick Troubles, was
not at lei&s;ure to pu&s;h on the Enterprize, tho it had been
fir&s;t &s;tarted by that eminent Mini&s;ter him&s;elf. This
Di&s;cour&s;e of <HI>Mon&s;ieur de Pagan</HI> is extracted for the
mo&s;t part out of <HI>Acugna,</HI> and is a &s;ort of Para|phra&s;e
upon him, full of Digre&s;&s;ions, and not com|parable
to the Original it &s;elf, which is more uniform
and authentick, containing abundance of remarkable
Ob&s;ervations, not mentioned by <HI>Pagan</HI> nor any other
Copi&s;t what&s;oever. The <HI>Cardinal</HI> was once re&s;olv'd
to plant five &s;everal Colonies; the fir&s;t in the <HI>I&s;le of

of the <HI>Amazone;</HI> the &s;econd on the <HI>Bo&s;phore</HI> or

to watch over the Spani&s;h Frontiers on that &s;ide
<PB N="vi" REF="4">
of the <HI>Andes:</HI> This was the Plan of his De&s;ign.
The many Difficulties of entring the Mouth, and
getting into the true Channel of this River of <HI>A|mazons,</HI>
have often di&s;couraged the <HI>Spaniards,
Engli&s;h,</HI> and <HI>Dutch</HI> from attempting to trade in it,
whereas upon Practice and Experience it might prove
as navigable as mo&s;t of the great Rivers of the World,
who&s;e Mouths are generally encumbred either with
Sands, Flats, I&s;les, or impetuous Currents, which
after a few Trials become familiar. The way pro|pounded
to the <HI>Cardinal</HI> was this. Fir&s;t &s;hun the
&s;trong Currents, by pa&s;&s;ing a&s;ide into 2 Degrees of
South Latitude; then &s;teer up agen by the Coa&s;t of
<HI>Brazil</HI> at 30 min. South Lat. double the Point of
<HI>Zaparara,</HI> and &s;ail to the South-we&s;t; after that
follow the Coa&s;t of the Province of <HI>Para,</HI> and pa&s;s
the Channel of the <HI>I&s;le of the Sun</HI> at 1 Deg. 15 Min.
South Lat. and 26 Leagues from the main Sea; la&s;t|ly,
&s;ail We&s;tward, leave the &s;ide of <HI>Para,</HI> and keep
the &s;ame Latitude to gain the Bank-&s;ide of <HI>Curupa,</HI>
and there enter into the be&s;t Road of this River at 2
deg. S. Lat. and 30 Leagues beyond <HI>Curupa,</HI> which
is but 1 deg. 30 min. on the &s;ame &s;ide of the Line.</P>
<P>Since that time the <HI>French</HI> being Ma&s;ters of the
<HI>I&s;le of Cayenne</HI> (which they have fortified and cul|tivated)
to the North of the <HI>Amazone,</HI> have not
(nor any other Nation that we know of) planted any
Countrey on this River, but have contented them&s;elves
with making Journeys into <HI>Guiana,</HI> particularly in
&s;earch of the va&s;t Lake of <HI>Parima,</HI> which the <HI>Spani|ards</HI>

is generally reckon'd to be above 1500 Miles. 'Tis
true, &s;ome may object that this doth not wholly de|&s;troy
the common <HI>Geography</HI> of that Country, and
give this plau&s;ible Argument, that the &s;imple innocent

that famous River, but al&s;o becau&s;e
they had very good Rea&s;ons to believe

&s;ome Per&s;ons undertook to go in
&s;earch of this River, but to no purpo&s;e.

<HEAD TYPE="sub">The way Gonzalles Pizarre took in pa&s;&s;ing

<P>THE March of our Adventurers was
retarded, not only by the Oppo&s;iti|on
they had from the People of the Coun|try,
who di&s;puted their Pa&s;&s;age, but al&s;o
<PB N="4" REF="9">
by continual Rains and Earthquakes &s;o
violent, that many Hou&s;es were over|turn'd,

Storms and Claps of Thunder, that
any one but <HI>Gonzalles Pizarre</HI> would have
abandon'd &s;uch an Enterprize as &s;eem'd to

However he with his Men did not give
over their March for all this bad Weather,
but cro&s;s'd the Province of the <HI>Quixos,</HI>
till they came to the foot of &s;ome high

make a part of tho&s;e which the Spaniards
call the <HI>Cordeliers,</HI> and which bound the

Tho the Rains &s;till continued they re|&s;olv'd
to pa&s;s over the Mountains, but
were not far advanc'd before the Rain
turn'd into a Snow &s;o thick and cold, that

the &s;ame fate, if they had continued their
March as they began: They concluded
that nothing but Expedition could &s;ave
'em from the Rigor of the Cold, and
therefore left all the Cattle they had with
them, and lighted them&s;elves of the re&s;t
of their Provi&s;ions and Baggage, hoping
they &s;hould find enough on t'other &s;ide of
<PB N="5" REF="9">
the Mountains. When they were got
over them, they enter'd into a Valley call'd
<HI>Zumaque,</HI> which is a hundred Leagues
from <HI>Quito</HI> by the account of good Geo|graphers;
there they found abundance of
Provi&s;ions and Refre&s;hments, and conti|nued
there two Months to acquaint them|&s;elves

they could make any advantage of it.
But this Place not an&s;wering the great

<HI>Pizarre</HI> parted from <HI>Zumaque</HI> with
&s;ixty good Souldiers to di&s;cover the Coun|try

found the way &s;o rough and mountainous,

&s;o much in one Night, that if the Senti|nels,

with all his Men, and after a March of
four Leagues, he met with a great Vil|lage
call'd <HI>Ampua,</HI> govern'd by a <HI>Cacique,</HI>
and found a great number of the Inha|bitants
in a po&s;ture of Defence expecting
their Enemy. But there was another and
a greater Ob&s;tacle in his way than this
<HI>Cacique</HI> and all his Troops, and that was
a River &s;o wide and deep, that he could
have no thoughts of venturing to &s;wim
over it. He could therefore find no bet|ter
Expedient than to enter into a Treaty
with the People of the Country, and to
de&s;ire the help of their Canoos to cro&s;s

thought of nothing more than

<P>THis long March having mightily

&s;top'd by a very &s;urprizing &s;ight: The
River was pre&s;s'd by two Rocks, one
on each &s;ide its Pa&s;&s;age, at no more than

Bridg to be made for his Troops
to pa&s;s over, which is &s;o much boa&s;ted

re&s;olv'd to make a Brigantine to carry

and gave the Command of it to <HI>Francis
Oreillane</HI> with fifty Souldiers, giving him
expre&s;s Order not to part far from him,
but to come every Night to the Camp.
He ob&s;erv'd this Order exactly, till his

either Sails or Oars: The Current of

concealing his De&s;ign, he hoi&s;ted up the

he thought of nothing but of pur|&s;uing

&s;hould di&s;cover it quite to the Sea. His

had been propo&s;ing to 'em, and thought

they ought to carry him the little Provi|&s;ion

leave two Canoos at the Bank of the two

<PB N="15" REF="14">

a Dominican Frier nam'd <HI>Ga&s;pard de Car|vajal,</HI>

that <HI>Oreillane</HI> &s;tifling their Gratitude by his
Di&s;&s;imulation, by fair Prote&s;tations and
great Promi&s;es appeas'd this Di&s;order.
By means of the Friends he had in the
Ve&s;&s;el he gain'd mo&s;t of the Souldiers that
were again&s;t him to his &s;ide; and &s;eeing
the two Heads of the other Party left
almo&s;t alone, he caus'd <HI>Fernand Sanches de

alone, without Victuals and without
Arms, in a di&s;mal Wilderne&s;s, bounded on
one &s;ide with high Mountains, and with a
River on the other: He had more Pru|dence
than to treat the Frier after the
&s;ame manner, yet he gave him to under|&s;tand,
that it was not for him to pene|trate
any more into the Preten&s;ions of his
Commander, unle&s;s he had a mind to be

<P>THE ill Succe&s;s of <HI>Oreillane</HI>'s Voyage
cool'd the ardent De&s;ire the Spa|niards
had for the Di&s;covery of the River
of <HI>Amazons;</HI> and it &s;eem'd quite extin|gui&s;h'd
by the Civil Wars of <HI>Peru,</HI> till
the Marque&s;s <HI>de Caguete</HI> being Vice-Roy
of that Kingdom, a Gentleman of <HI>Navarre,</HI>
nam'd <HI>Peter de Or&s;ua,</HI> who had always en|tertain'd
Thoughts worthy of his great
Courage, turn'd his De&s;igns on this great
River, and believ'd he &s;hould be more
fortunate than <HI>Oreillane:</HI> He pre&s;ented him|&s;elf
to the Vice-Roy, and propos'd his
De&s;ign to him; who being well acquainted
with his Merit, commended his Re&s;olu|tion,
and was per&s;waded, that if &s;o diffi|cult
a matter &s;hould &s;ucceed, it mu&s;t be
by the Conduct of &s;o brave and wi&s;e a
Commander. He immediately di&s;patch'd
all nece&s;&s;ary Orders for him, and caus'd a
<PB N="23" REF="18">
Publication of his Attempt to be made
throughout the Kingdom. Mo&s;t of the
Gentry came to offer their Service to <HI>Or|&s;ua;</HI>
who was &s;o much in every one's
E&s;teem, that there was no Souldier &s;o old,
but would leave his Retirement with Plea|&s;ure
to &s;erve under &s;o excellent a General.
His chief trouble was to return his Thanks
to &s;o many of 'em as he could not take
along with him: he made choice of &s;uch
among&s;t 'em as were mo&s;t fit for his pur|po&s;e;
and to carry on the famous Conque&s;t
he de&s;ign'd, he made all nece&s;&s;ary Provi|&s;ions
both of Ammunition and Victuals, to
which all the Lords and the Inhabitants of
the Towns contributed with a great deal
of Freedom and Liberality, being well
per&s;waded that <HI>Or&s;ua</HI> had Qualities that
well de&s;erv'd to be oblig'd. He parted
from <HI>Cu&s;co</HI> in 1560, with the Acclamati|ons
and good Wi&s;hes of all the Inhabitants
of that Place; he was attended with above
&s;even hundred choice Souldiers, and with a
con&s;iderable number of very good Hor&s;es.
Being well vers'd in the Map of <HI>Peru,</HI>
and having for &s;ome time been laying the
Scheme of his Journey, he march'd direct|ly
to the Province of <HI>Mo&s;ilones,</HI> fir&s;t to meet
the River <HI>Moyabamba,</HI> by which he was &s;ure
of entring into the River of <HI>Amazons.</HI></P>

<P>ONE would have hop'd an Attempt
&s;o wi&s;ely laid, and &s;o univer&s;ally ap|prov'd,
&s;hould have had a happy I&s;&s;ue:
Yet never was any Project more un&s;ucce&s;s|ful;
for <HI>Or&s;ua</HI> had taken with him one <HI>Don
Fernand de Gu&s;man,</HI> a young Man who was
lately come from <HI>Spain,</HI> and another more
advanc'd in Years, named <HI>Lopez Daguirre</HI>
of <HI>Bi&s;cay,</HI> a little ill-favour'd Man, whom
he had made his En&s;ign. The&s;e two
Wretches fell in Love with their General's

had accompanied her Husband in all his

together, engag'd <HI>Or&s;ua</HI>'s Troops to
revolt, and a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inated him. After this
Tragical Fact the Traitors who commit|ted
it, who to the number of &s;even or
eight were in a &s;trict Confederacy, elected
<PB N="25" REF="19">
<HI>Don Fernand de Gu&s;man</HI> for their King;
who&s;e Mind was vain enough to receive
that Title which became him &s;o little: But
he did not enjoy it long; for tho&s;e very
Per&s;ons that had given him the Quality of
King, gave him his Death's Wound too,
and <HI>Daguirre</HI> &s;ucceeded him, who made
him&s;elf King, notwith&s;tanding the Re|mon&s;trances
of others: And naming him|&s;elf
the Rebel and Traitor, he gave all tho&s;e
he had gain'd to his Party to under&s;tand,
that he intended to make him&s;elf Ma&s;ter
of <HI>Guiana,</HI> of <HI>Peru,</HI> and of the new King|dom
of <HI>Grenada,</HI> and promis'd 'em all the
Riches of tho&s;e great Kingdoms. His
Reign was &s;o bloody and barbarous, that
the like Tyranny was &s;carce ever heard of
in the World: Therefore the Spaniards to
this day call him the Tyrant. However
he commanded <HI>Or&s;ua</HI>'s Ve&s;&s;els, and went
down the River <HI>Coca</HI> into the <HI>Amazone,</HI>
hoping to obtain one of tho&s;e Kingdoms,
and to make a con&s;iderable Progre&s;s into it.
But having enter'd the <HI>Amazone,</HI> he was
not able to ma&s;ter the Current of it, and
&s;o was con&s;trained to &s;uffer him&s;elf to be
carried down to the Mouth of a River a|bove
a thou&s;and Leagues from the place
where he imbark'd, and was driven in|to
the great Channel which goes to the
<PB N="26" REF="20">
North-Cape, being the &s;ame way <HI>Oreillane</HI>
had taken before him. Going out of the
<HI>Amazone,</HI> he came to the I&s;land of St. <HI>Mar|guerite,</HI>
which is to this day call'd the Ty|rant's
Port; there he kill'd <HI>Don Irean de
Villa Andrada,</HI> Governour of the I&s;land,
and <HI>Don John Sermiento</HI> his Father. After
their Death, with the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of one
<HI>John Burq,</HI> he made him&s;elf Ma&s;ter of
the I&s;land, plunder'd it intirely, and there
committed unheard-of Barbarities. He
kill'd all that oppos'd him, and pa&s;t from
thence to <HI>Cumana,</HI> where he exercis'd the
&s;ame Cruelties: He after that de&s;olated all
tho&s;e Coa&s;ts that bear the Name of <HI>Ca|racas,</HI>
and all the Provinces along the Ri|vers
<HI>Venezuella</HI> and <HI>Baccho.</HI> He then came
to St. <HI>Martha,</HI> where he put all to the
Sword, and enter'd the new Kingdom of
<HI>Grenada,</HI> de&s;igning to march from thence
through <HI>Quito</HI> into <HI>Peru.</HI> In this King|dom
he was forc'd to a Battel, in which he
was utterly defeated, and put to flight, but
all Ways being &s;top'd, he found he mu&s;t
peri&s;h; and therefore begins his Tragedy
with a &s;ort of Barbarity without Example.</P>
<P>He had a Daughter by his Wife <HI>Mendo|za,</HI>
that had follow'd him in his Expedi|tions,
and whom he lov'd entirely. Daugh|ter
(&s;ays he to her) I mu&s;t kill thee; I
<PB N="27" REF="20">
de&s;ign'd to have plac'd thee on a Throne,
but &s;ince Fortune oppo&s;es it, I am not wil|ling
thou &s;hould&s;t live to &s;uffer the Shame

of being call'd the Daughter of a Tyrant
and a Traitor. Die, my Child, die by
the Hand of thy Father, if thou ha&s;t not
Courage enough to die by thy own. She
&s;urpriz'd at this Di&s;cour&s;e, de&s;ir'd him at
lea&s;t to give her &s;ome time to prepare for
Death, and to beg of God the Pardon of
her Sins: This he granted; but thinking
her too tedious in her Devotion, as &s;he
was praying upon her Knees he &s;hot her
through the Body with a Carbine; but
having not kill'd her out-right, he &s;tuck
his Dagger into her Heart. She falling
down at the Stroke, cry'd, Ah, Father,
'tis enough!</P>
<P>Soon after her Death he was taken and
carried Pri&s;oner to the I&s;land <HI>La Trini|dada,</HI>
where he had a con&s;iderable E&s;tate.
His Proce&s;s was made, and he condemn'd
to be quarter'd; he was publickly execu|ted,

end of it: they de&s;ir'd <HI>Texeira</HI> to di&s;mi&s;s
'em, and finding he put 'em off from day
to day, many tack'd about and return'd to
<HI>Para.</HI> The General perceiv'd, that on this
occa&s;ion he mu&s;t u&s;e Prudence rather than
Force, therefore he did not cau&s;e them
that were fled back to be pur&s;u'd, but en|deavour'd
with all imaginable Mildne&s;s to
hinder others from following their Exam|ple:
To this end he treated the Indians
that remain'd with very kind Words, and
&s;o extremely pleas'd 'em with his Di&s;|cour&s;e,
that tho&s;e that heard him convey'd
it from one Canoo to another with tho&s;e
external Demon&s;trations of Joy and Sati&s;|faction,
which they u&s;e to expre&s;s in their
A&s;&s;emblies, &s;o that they unanimou&s;ly cry'd
from all the Canoos, that they were wil|ling
<HI>Texeira</HI> &s;hould continue his Voyage,
and that they would never leave him. The
General having given 'em his Thanks for
their goodwill, caus'd &s;ome Brandy to be
di&s;tributed through all the Canoos, a&s;&s;uring
'em they would in a little time arrive at
the Place de&s;ign'd. And not content in
<PB N="39" REF="26">
having &s;pread this Report among 'em, to
fix the Indians the more firmly in their
Re&s;olution, he thought it nece&s;&s;ary to do
&s;omewhat that might &s;till make a greater
appearance for their Encouragement. To
this purpo&s;e he vi&s;ited all the Canoos, and
cho&s;e out eight of the be&s;t of 'em, which
he loaded with Provi&s;ion, Souldiers and
Rowers. He made Colonel <HI>Benedito Ro|driguez
d'Olivera,</HI> a Native of <HI>Brazil,</HI> Com|mander
of this Squadron; and having
communicated his De&s;ign to him, &s;ent him
away with a Charge to &s;end him often &s;uch
News as might be mo&s;t agreeable to the
Indians. <HI>Olivera</HI> was no ordinary Man,
he had naturally a quick and piercing Wit;
and having been all his Life brought up
with the Indians, he had &s;o well &s;tudied
their Actions and Countenances, that they
could hardly di&s;&s;emble &s;o well, but he could
with one ca&s;t of his Eye di&s;cover what was
in their Minds; &s;o that they look'd upon
him as a Man that could divine what o|thers
thought; and from this Conceit they
had not only a great Veneration for him,
but &s;tood &s;o much in awe of him, that
they yielded him a blind Obedience in what
he commanded 'em. It is not to be que&s;ti|on'd
after this, whether tho&s;e in the eight
Canoos which he was to command were
<PB N="40" REF="27">
very willing to go with him. His Men
were &s;o indu&s;trious one while at their Oars,

The Portuguez General who had

that the Source of this great River pro|ceeds
from the Mountains of <HI>Moida</HI> in
the new Kingdom of <HI>Granada,</HI> and is
call'd the River <HI>Caquetta:</HI> but they are

<HI>Caquetta</HI> &s;eems to turn its Cour&s;e, and

<P>Tho the&s;e frequent Inundations &s;eem to
be attended with great Inconveniences;
yet the Author of Nature has taught the&s;e
Barbarians to make a good Improvement
of them. Before the&s;e Floods come, they
gather in all their <HI>Yuca,</HI> of which Root
they make a &s;ort of Bread called <HI>Ca&s;&s;ave,</HI>
which is ordinarily u&s;ed in all the Coa&s;ts

of the Continent and I&s;lands of <HI>America.</HI>
They make great Caves in the Ground,
wherein they put the&s;e Roots; and having
well &s;topp'd them up with Earth, leave
'em there as long as the Flood la&s;ts: this is
an infallible way of pre&s;erving tho&s;e Roots
which otherwi&s;e would be &s;ubject to rot

When the Waters are run off, they open

and eat them, without finding them at all

<P>THe Roots of Yuca we have been

Bread, which they eat with their other
Food; be&s;ides this they make a Drink of it,
which they all generally e&s;teem as the mo&s;t
delicious and excellent Liquor in the World.
To make the Bread, they &s;queeze out all
the Juice of the Root, and then beat and
pound it, till 'tis become a kind of Meal,
of which they make great Cakes, and
bake them in an Oven; this they call <HI>Ca&s;|&s;ave,</HI>
which has a very plea&s;ant Ta&s;te
when 'tis new, but after one day becomes
very dry, &s;o that it may be kept &s;everal
Months; they ordinarily put it on the tops
<PB N="59" REF="36">
of their Huts, that it may keep the more
dry. And when they have a mind to make
their Drink, they take the&s;e dry Cakes, and
temper them in Water, which they boil
as long as they think &s;ufficient, over a
gentle Fire: This Pa&s;te boil'd thus in
Water, makes a Drink &s;o &s;trong by its great
Fermentation, that it fuddles 'em like our
Wine. They u&s;e this Drink at all their

any Gue&s;ts, when they celebrate their
Fea&s;ts, at their Seed-time, and Harve&s;t;
in a word, at all times when they meet,
this Liquor is the Spirit that animates 'em,
and the Charm that holds 'em together.
They make be&s;ides this, another &s;ort of
Drink, with a great deal of wild Fruit,
of which they have extraordinary plenty;
this they peel, and put in Water, with
which when it is well mix'd, it &s;oon by
Fermentation acquires &s;uch a Savour and

<P>FI&s;h is &s;o common with 'em, that when
any one offers it to 'em, they prover|bially
&s;ay, E'ne put it in your own Di&s;h.
There is &s;o great a number of 'em in the
River, that without any other Nets than
their Hands, they can take as many as they
plea&s;e. But the <HI>Pege Buey</HI> is as it were
the King of all the Fi&s;h that &s;wim in
the River <HI>Amazone,</HI> from its Source till it
di&s;charges it &s;elf into the Sea. 'Tis not
to be imagin'd what a delicious Ta&s;te this
Fi&s;h has, any one that eats it would think
it to be mo&s;t excellent Fle&s;h well &s;ea&s;on'd:
This Fi&s;h is as big as a Heifer of a Year
and a half old, it has a Head and Ears ju&s;t
like tho&s;e of a Heifer, and the Body of it
is all cover'd with Hair, like the Bri&s;tles
of a white Hog; it &s;wims with two little
Arms, and under its Belly it has Teats
with which it &s;uckles its young Ones: The
Skin of it is very thick, and when 'tis
dre&s;s'd into Leather it &s;erves to make Tar|gets
that are Proof again&s;t a Mu&s;quet Bul|let.
This Fi&s;h feeds upon Gra&s;s on the
Bank of the River, like an Ox, from which
it receives &s;o good Nouri&s;hment, and is
<PB N="62" REF="38">
of &s;o plea&s;ant a Ta&s;te, that a Man is more
&s;trengthen'd and better &s;atisfied in eating a
&s;mall quantity of it, than in eating twice as
much Mutton: This Fi&s;h has not free Re|&s;piration
in the Water, and therefore often
thru&s;ts out its Snout to take Breath, and is
by this means di&s;cover'd to them that &s;eek
after it. When the Indians get the &s;ight of
it, they follow it with their Oars in little
Canoos; and when it appears above Water
to get Breath, they throw at it their &s;ort of
Harping-Irons made of Shells, with which
they &s;top its cour&s;e, and take it: when they
have kill'd it, they cut it into good pieces,
and broil it upon Wooden Grates, which
they call <HI>Boucan;</HI> and being thus dre&s;s'd,
'twill keep good above a Month: They
have not the way of &s;alting and drying it
to keep a great while, becau&s;e they have

<HEAD TYPE="sub">The Means the Indians u&s;e to pre&s;erve their
Fi&s;h in tho&s;e Sea&s;ons wherein they can nei|ther
fi&s;h nor hunt.</HEAD>
<P>THO the Indians don't know how
to keep their broil'd Fi&s;h very long,
yet they &s;u&s;tain no great damage by it,
becau&s;e Nature has given them Indu&s;try
enough to get fre&s;h Meat all their Winter,
which is the time of the Rains, during
which they can neither hunt nor fi&s;h. For
this purpo&s;e they make choice of &s;ome fit
places where the Floods can never come,
and there they dig a kind of a Pond of a
moderate depth, to hold a good quantity
of Water, which they inclo&s;e round with
a Pali&s;ado of Stakes; they bring Water
into the&s;e Ponds, and keep 'em always
full, that they may u&s;e 'em as Re&s;ervers
for their Winter Provi&s;ions. At the &s;ea|&s;on
when the Tortoi&s;es come a&s;hore to
lay their Eggs, the Indians go to lie in
Ambu&s;h in the places where they know
they ordinarily come; and when they &s;ee
a &s;ufficient number upon the &s;hore, they
go and turn 'em upon their Backs, to hin|der
'em from retreating; and when they
have thus &s;ecur'd 'em, they begin at their
<PB N="64" REF="39">
lei&s;ure to carry 'em to their Re&s;ervers:
for this end, when they are at any con&s;i|derable
di&s;tance from their Huts, they
&s;tring all their Tortoi&s;es together with
great Cords through holes that they make
on the top of their Shells, and turning 'em
upon their Feet lead 'em to the Water,
where they tie 'em to their Canoos, and &s;o
make 'em follow them home: when they
are got home, they put 'em in their Re|&s;ervers,
and unloo&s;e 'em, feeding 'em with
the Leaves and Branches of Trees which
they throw into them, and take 'em out
to &s;pend as they want 'em. One of the&s;e
Tortoi&s;es is enough to feed a numerous
Family &s;ome time; &s;o that 'tis not to be
wonder'd at, that the&s;e Indians are never
reduc'd to Scarcity, &s;eeing they make Pro|vi&s;ion
of &s;o great a number of Tortoi&s;es,
having commonly above a hundred in each
Re&s;erver; &s;o that the proportion they pro|vide
for each Per&s;on in their Families is
enough to maintain &s;everal People. The&s;e
Tortoi&s;es are as large as tho&s;e Targets
Souldiers formerly us'd to defend them|&s;elves
withal, and their Fle&s;h is as good as
that of a Heifer. At the time of their
laying, &s;ome Females are found with two
or three hundred Eggs in their Belly big|ger
than tho&s;e of Pullets, and as good, tho
<PB N="65" REF="39">
not of &s;o ea&s;y Dige&s;tion. At one Sea&s;on
of the Year they are &s;o fat, that a good
Barrel of Fat may be taken out of 'em,
which is as good as Butter, and being
&s;alted a little, ta&s;tes extraordinary well, and
keeps very well too; this will not only
&s;erve to fry Fi&s;h, but is likewi&s;e as good
for Sauces as the be&s;t Butter in the World:
&s;o that the&s;e Barbarians have no ab&s;olute
need of our Commodities, but make as
good Provi&s;ion for their Nece&s;&s;ities, as the
mo&s;t civiliz'd Nations in the World can do.
'Tis not ami&s;s further to remark two things
in re&s;pect of the&s;e Tortoi&s;es; one is, that
after they have made a Hole in the Sand
above the Bounds of the highe&s;t Tides,
they lay all their Eggs at a time, one after
another, after which they carefully cover
them up with the &s;ame Sand they have
digged up to make their Ne&s;t, &s;o that 'tis
impo&s;&s;ible for any to di&s;cover the place of
it. Then they return backwards into the
Water, to prevent the notice of their true
Track, and never come a&s;hore again till
the next Year, leaving their Eggs to be
hatch'd by the Heat of the Sun, which is
always accompli&s;h'd in forty days; after
which the young ones are &s;een to creep
out of the Sand, being about the bigne&s;s
of a Crown, and thus in a train, like Ants,
they make to the Water. The other Re|mark
<PB N="66" REF="40">
is, that the Sea-men bone 'em, and
&s;alt them, and &s;o carry 'em into all the
Colonies of the <HI>Antego</HI> I&s;lands, a Trade
in which many Captains and Merchants
have found their Account.</P>

they &s;eem to want every thing; but their
Winter being pa&s;t, their Fears are carried
away with it, and they have plenty of all
things; &s;o that they never take care for the
Morrow: and becau&s;e they don't think
of wanting any thing the en&s;uing day,
they make no other Provi&s;ion for it, than in
feeding them&s;elves well to day, that they
may be the &s;tronger and more ready in
&s;eeking their Food to morrow. They have
all imaginable Dexterity in catching all
&s;orts of Fi&s;h that are in this River, and
have as many ways for it as there is diver|&s;ity
of Sea&s;ons. When the Inundations
dimini&s;h, and leave Lakes in the lower
<PB N="67" REF="40">
parts of the Lands that have been over|flow'd,
they have a very plea&s;ant Trick
to take the Fi&s;h that are left in tho&s;e
places: They &s;trike the Water with two
or three flat Sticks, with the noi&s;e of
which the Fi&s;h are no &s;ooner &s;tunn'd, but
they come up to the top of the Water, as
if they were dead, and &s;uffer them&s;elves to
be taken up with the hand: Not that it is
the Noi&s;e that produces this Effect, but
the Quality of the Wood, which makes
the Fi&s;h drunk. The <HI>Galibis</HI> who are the
Natives of <HI>Cayen,</HI> and of one part of <HI>Guia|na,</HI>
make u&s;e of it, and call it <HI>Inecou.</HI></P>
<P>But the mo&s;t common way of fi&s;hing
which they u&s;e at all times, and on all
occa&s;ions, is with an Arrow which they
dart with one hand from a &s;mooth little
Board which they hold in t'other. This
Arrow having pierc'd the Fi&s;h, &s;erves in|&s;tead
of a Cork to &s;hew which way it
moves when it is wounded; they pur&s;ue
it in their Canoos, and getting hold of
the end of the Arrow they draw up the
Fi&s;h with it: they catch all &s;orts of Fi&s;h
after this manner, neither &s;mall nor great
can e&s;cape their Weapons. And there are
&s;o many &s;orts of 'em in this River, and all
of 'em &s;o excellent, that it would be too
tedious a bu&s;ine&s;s to give an ample De|&s;cription

<PB N="68" REF="41">
the re&s;t which the Indians call <HI>Paraque,</HI>
which re&s;embles a great Eel, or rather a
&s;mall Conger, which has a very &s;trange
Property; for if a Man takes it in his
Hand while 'tis alive, immediately a Cold|ne&s;s

were taken with a fit of an Ague; but the

Heat than tho&s;e that inhabit along this Ri|ver

three or four hours in a day, and &s;ometimes

but have be&s;ides the Property of pre&s;erv|ing

I have had the Experience of it
my &s;elf in the Wafers we carried with us,
which at the end of five Months and a

<P>And tho all this long &s;tretch of Land is

of the Sun is not at all hurtful, nor the
Evening Air neither, tho it be very cool
and moi&s;t. I have good rea&s;on to te&s;tify
this, for during our whole Voyage I have
commonly pa&s;s'd whole Nights in the o|pen
Air, without getting the lea&s;t Pain in
my Head, or the lea&s;t Defluxion of Rhume;
and yet in all other Places, the lea&s;t walk|ing
abroad in a Moon-&s;hiny Night, has
very much incommoded me. 'Tis true,
at the beginning of our Voyage, almo&s;t all
<PB N="73" REF="43">
of our Men that came from cold Coun|tries
had Agues, but were all cur'd by
bleeding three or four times. We neither
felt, nor heard of any &s;uch bad Air along
this River, as there is in almo&s;t all other
places of <HI>Peru</HI> that have been di&s;cover'd,
where People are &s;ometimes in a moment
taken with violent Rhumati&s;ms through|out

but from a &s;udden Corruption of the

to an incurable Pal&s;y, and co&s;t others their

would be capable of enriching many King|doms;
the fir&s;t is <HI>Wood</HI> for building, of
which there is &s;ome found of a rare and

there is &s;o prodigious a quantity of com|mon
Wood, that is worth tran&s;porting,

<P>The &s;econd thing is the <HI>Coco-tree,</HI>
which &s;erves for the Compo&s;ition of Cho|colat;
with the&s;e the Banks of the River

<PB N="78" REF="46">
throughout all <HI>New Spain,</HI> and in all other

is. Every Foot of this Tree will produce
eight Silver Rials, all Charges paid. And
it may ea&s;ily be &s;uppos'd there's no need of
great labour to cultivate the&s;e Trees along
this River, &s;eeing Nature, without the
A&s;&s;i&s;tance of Husbandry and Art, makes
'em bring forth Fruit in &s;o great abundance.</P>
<P>The third is <HI>Tobacco,</HI> of which there
is a prodigious quantity along this River,
which is very much e&s;teem'd by all the

of all, and for the &s;ake of which in my

yet they have not &s;o much Faith in any of
'em, but that they freely acknowledg
that there may po&s;&s;ibly be a God who is
greater and more powerful than the&s;e. I
made this Judgment upon what pa&s;s'd be|tween
us and one of the&s;e Savage People,
who yet &s;hew'd nothing in his Conver&s;a|tion
that &s;avour'd of a barbarous Educa|tion:
This Indian had heard &s;ome of our
Men &s;peak of the Almighty Power of
God; and con&s;idering what he had &s;een
with his own Eyes, that our Army had
navigated this great River throughout its
whole Cour&s;e, and after having pa&s;s'd
through &s;o many different Warlike Nati|ons,
was return'd without having receiv'd
the lea&s;t Damage or Prejudice from any of
'em, he thought this could not be, unle&s;s
the A&s;&s;i&s;tance and Power of God had con|ducted
us: upon this Imagination he came
to meet us, and with a great deal of Con|cern
and di&s;quiet of Mind &s;ignified to us,
that for all the kind Entertainment he had
given us, he de&s;ir'd no other Recompence
but that we would leave him one of our
Gods, &s;eeing they were &s;o good and pow|erful,
that &s;o he might take him and his
Va&s;&s;als into his Protection, that he might
make 'em live in Peace and Health, and
continually give 'em whatever they &s;tood
in need of for their Pre&s;ervation. Our Men
<PB N="94" REF="54">
did not fail to promi&s;e him whatever he
de&s;ir'd, and would fain have &s;et up the
Standard of the Cro&s;s in his Village for a
certain Mark. This is a Cu&s;tom the Por|tuguez
have introduc'd throughout all
places where Idols are wor&s;hip'd; I know
not whether they do it from a true Princi|ple
of Zeal, as the Action it &s;elf &s;eems to
&s;ignify, for there is a great deal of rea&s;on
to doubt that they &s;et up the &s;acred Sign
of the Cro&s;s only for a &s;pecious Pretext to
make Slaves of the poor Indians, whom
they carry away from their very Hou&s;es,
either for their own Service, or to &s;ell 'em
to others; which gave me an extreme Com|pa&s;&s;ion
for the&s;e People who don't &s;eem
unteachable, and might be more ea&s;ily
brought to the Knowledg of the true God
by a courteous and gentle Carriage, than
by all the Rigor that can be us'd upon 'em.
What I have &s;aid is certainly true, that
when the Portuguez have been kindly re|ceiv'd
and well treated by the&s;e hone&s;t and
charitable Indians, they in return to all
their Ho&s;pitality only leave 'em the Sign
of the Cro&s;s, which they &s;et up in the
mo&s;t eminent place of their Habitations,
commanding 'em to keep this holy Sign
with &s;o great Care that it may never be
defac'd; and after this when this Cro&s;s
happens either to be thrown down by the
<PB N="95" REF="54">
Injuries of the Weather, or to be worn
out, or it may be to be maliciou&s;ly broken
in pieces by &s;ome of tho&s;e Idolatrous In|dians
who bear no re&s;pect to it, the Por|tuguez
never fail to condemn 'em all as
guilty of the Profanation of the Cro&s;s,
and as &s;uch, declare both them and all
their Children and Childrens Children
perpetual Slaves. This was the main rea|&s;on
that ingag'd me to forbid the Portu|guez
to leave the Cro&s;s among the&s;e Peo|ple;
be&s;ides, I was not willing that this
<HI>Cacique</HI> that had ask'd us for a God, &s;hould
have any occa&s;ion to believe that our God
was a piece of Wood, and that this had
the Power and Divinity of him that &s;av'd
us on the Cro&s;s, for fear of confirming him
in Idolatry. I therefore comforted him the
be&s;t I could, and told him the God we
wor&s;hip'd would be always with him, and
advis'd him to pray to him for whatever
he wanted, and to put his Tru&s;t intirely
in him, telling him I believ'd he would
one day favour him with the Knowledg of
the true Religion. By this it appears that
this Indian did not believe his Idols were
powerful Gods, &s;eeing he was &s;o ready to
for&s;ake 'em to wor&s;hip a greater Deity, if
we would have given him one.</P>

would be &s;ure frequently to return to bring

&s;ome Mi&s;chief or other from their

they perform their &s;uper&s;titious Exerci&s;es,
and conver&s;e with the Devil, (a very com|mon

&s;erves for no other purpo&s;e. They al&s;o

the Reliques of Saints: when they have
put their Bones altogether, they hang 'em
in the Air in the &s;ame Cotton Beds tho&s;e
Wizards us'd to lie in while alive. The&s;e

&s;ought to be reveng'd; for it being
contrary to their Humour to put up Injuries,

flew upon their Enemies, and repuls'd
them with &s;o much Vigor, that with the lo&s;s

number of Indians, and took above 70 of 'em
Pri&s;oners; &s;ome of whom died in the places of
their Confinement, and the re&s;t made their

their Swords in their hands to fetch Provi&s;ion

Accordingly they re&s;olv'd to make Incur&s;ions
into the Country, and either by fair means or
&s;oul to get a Supply for their pinching Nece&s;|&s;ities.
Some of 'em went out to fight, and
others kept the Camp; but both the one and
the other in &s;pite of all their Bravery did not
fail to meet with frequent and violent In&s;ults
from their Enemies, who omitted no fit oc|ca&s;ion

pillaged, and brake others of 'em in pieces:

is the mo&s;t rea&s;onable and be&s;t civilized

not long &s;ince went down among&s;t 'em from

to be carried down with the Stream

took up their Re&s;idence with 'em. The&s;e
la&s;t Comers introduc'd among the others
&s;everal things they had &s;een practi&s;ed by the

were all clothed, both Men and Women,
with all the Decency imaginable; their Gar|ments

that not without rea&s;on) with the Beauty

deck their Stuffs: they make &s;ome very thin

&s;o &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive and obedient to their principal
Caciques, that the&s;e whom they look upon as
their Princes, need &s;peak but a Word to have
whatever they command put in execution.</P>
<P>This whole Nation has been &s;o long accu&s;|tomed
to make their Heads flat, that as &s;oon
as their Children are born they put them in
a kind of Pre&s;s; forcing Nature after this
manner with one little Board, which they hold
upon the Forehead, and another much lar|ger,
which they put behind the Head, and
which &s;erves them for a Cradle; and all
the re&s;t of the Body of the new-born Infant
is as it were inclos'd with this piece of
Wood: they lay the Child upon his Back,
<PB N="119" REF="66">
and this Board being bound fa&s;t to that
which is upon the Forehead, they make the
Head of the Child almo&s;t as &s;lat as ones Hand;

grow, but by &s;preading it &s;elf wide from

<P>The <HI>Aguas</HI> have perpetual War with &s;e|veral

<P>THe&s;e <HI>Aguas</HI> make Slaves of all the Pri|&s;oners
they take in War, and u&s;e 'em
for all kinds of Service; however they treat
'em with &s;o much Love and Kindne&s;s, that
they make 'em eat with them&s;elves; and
there's nothing in the World di&s;plea&s;es 'em
more, than to de&s;ire 'em to &s;ell 'em, as we
found by experience on &s;everal occa&s;ions: I
remember once at our Arrival at an Indian
Town, they received us not only with all the
Marks of Peace and Amity, but even with
all the Tokens of extraordinary Joy: They
offer'd us all they had for our Su&s;tenance,
without requiring any thing in return: We
on our parts &s;hewed that Civility to them that
became us; we bought their painted Cotton-Cloth,
which they very willingly parted
with; we de&s;ired 'em to &s;ell us &s;ome Canoos,
which are better to them than the be&s;t and
&s;wifte&s;t Hor&s;es, and they pre&s;ently offer'd
'em to us; but when we began to talk with
'em about their Slaves, and to importune 'em
to &s;ell us &s;ome of 'em, this was to them
the mo&s;t uncivil and inhumane Di&s;cour&s;e
that could be: one of them pre&s;ently gave
<PB N="121" REF="67">
us to under&s;tand that he would no longer keep
company with us; another &s;hew'd him&s;elf
mightily troubled at the matter: On the one
hand they were very diligent to hide 'em
from us, on the other to get &s;ome of 'em that
were with us out of our Hands; in a word,
they gave us Signs enough to convince us,
that they had a greater e&s;teem for their Slaves
than for all the re&s;t of their Goods, and that
they had rather part with all they po&s;&s;e&s;s'd
be&s;ides than part with them. And this be|ing
the truth of the matter, 'tis a malicious
thing of the Portuguez to report that the rea|&s;on
why the <HI>Aguas</HI> are unwilling to &s;ell their
Slaves, is becau&s;e they fatten 'em, and keep
'em to eat at their Fea&s;ts: This is a Calumny
they have invented, to palliate the Cruelties
they have exerci&s;ed upon the&s;e poor Wretch|es.
I may farther add, that at lea&s;t as far
as concerns the Nation of the <HI>Aguas</HI> I have
found the contrary true by the Te&s;timony of
two Indians that were Natives of <HI>Para,</HI> who
came up with the Portuguez as far as <HI>Quito,</HI>
and ran away when they were arriv'd there;
who falling into the hands of the&s;e People,
were made Slaves, and remained with them
eight Months: the&s;e a&s;&s;ured me they had
been out with them at their Wars, and that
they never &s;aw 'em eat any of their Enemies,
when they had taken 'em, and made Slaves
of 'em: 'twas true indeed (they &s;aid) when
<PB N="122" REF="68">
they had taken any of their Enemies that had
the Reputation of being Valiant and Great,
they kill'd 'em at their Fea&s;ts and A&s;&s;emblies,
only out of fear of &s;u&s;taining &s;ome con&s;ider|able
Damage by 'em, if they &s;hould &s;uffer
'em to live; but that they did not eat the&s;e
neither when they had kill'd 'em, but when
they had cut off their Heads, which they
us'd to hang up in their Huts as Trophies,
they roll'd their Bodies into the River.</P>
<P>I don't deny that there are &s;ome <HI>Caribees</HI>
in tho&s;e Parts that eat their Enemies without
any Sentiments of Horror; but this is a
Cu&s;tom peculiar to them, and is not practi|&s;ed
among other Indians. And this I de|&s;ire
may be taken notice of and credited, that
Human Fle&s;h has never been &s;old in any of
the Publick Shambles of this Nation, as the
Portuguez have reported; who under the
pretence of revenging &s;uch kind of Cruel|ties,
commit tho&s;e that are incomparably
greater them&s;elves, &s;ince they are &s;o inhu|man

<P>OUR Fleet lay &s;till at Anchor in the

day of <HI>October,</HI> in the Year 1639, when the
Portuguez Souldiers calling to mind that
they were now almo&s;t as good as at home,
and had got nothing the&s;e two Years &s;ince
they went out, began to look upon the end
<PB N="151" REF="82">
of their Voyage as the greate&s;t Misfortune
that could befal them, and to tell one ano|ther,
that &s;ince they had reap'd no other Ad|vantage
by all the Labour and Hard&s;hip
they had pa&s;s'd through but the lo&s;s of two
long Years, and the Increa&s;e of their Mi&s;e|ries,
they ought to con&s;ider what they had
to do while opportunity offer'd it &s;elf; and
that it would be a ridiculous thing to expect
of his Catholick Maje&s;ty the Reward of
tho&s;e Services they had render'd him in the
Di&s;covery of &s;o many Countries, &s;eeing a
great many others before them, who had
been prodigal of their Blood, and hazarded
their Lives for the Advancement of the Gran|deur
of <HI>Spain,</HI> had for all that died upon a
Dunghil, not knowing to whom to apply
them&s;elves for the Relief of their Nece&s;&s;ities.
The&s;e &s;editious Words being received with
Applau&s;e by the greate&s;t part of the Portu|guez,
they immediately re&s;olv'd to &s;peak
their Minds to their General, and to engage
him one way or other to fall in with their De|&s;igns.</P>
<P>No &s;ooner had they taken up this Re&s;olu|tion,
but they addre&s;&s;ed them&s;elves to him,
telling him, it was needle&s;s for them to re|pre&s;ent
to him the mi&s;erable Condition they
were in, &s;ince he knew it as well as them|&s;elves;
that they had now been for two
Years roving up and down upon the&s;e Ri|vers,
<PB N="152" REF="83">
where they were every day in danger
of peri&s;hing, either by Hunger or exce&s;&s;ive
Labour, or by the Arrows of the Savages;
and therefore begg'd him to compa&s;&s;ionate
their Nece&s;&s;ity, and not to take it ami&s;s that
they &s;ought &s;ome Relief; that they were &s;ure
that only along the Black River they could
get as many of tho&s;e Slaves which the Indi|ans
had taken in War, as would turn to a
con&s;iderable account to them; and tho they
&s;hould bring nothing home from their Voy|age
but the&s;e Slaves, they hop'd they &s;hould
not be ill receiv'd by their Friends at <HI>Para,</HI>
but that if they &s;hould return home empty-handed,
and &s;hould bring no Slaves with
them after they had pa&s;s'd through &s;o many
populous Provinces, the Inhabitants of which
dur&s;t come to their very Doors to make
Slaves of them, they &s;hould be reckon'd the
mo&s;t cowardly and infamous Wretches in
the World.</P>
<P>The General con&s;idering he was but one
again&s;t a great many, and perceiving a Mu|tiny
was already form'd in the Minds of the
Souldiers, thought it not his be&s;t way to irri|tate
them any more, but gave 'em permi&s;&s;ion
to put this Enterprize in execution, &s;eeing
the Wind favour'd their Entrance into the
Black River, and &s;eem'd to invite 'em to this
Project. The Portuguez were tran&s;ported
with Joy that they had obtain'd this Leave,
<PB N="153" REF="83">
and there was not one among&s;t 'em but pro|mis'd
him&s;elf at lea&s;t 300 Slaves for his &s;hare.
This Re&s;olution gave me no &s;mall Unea&s;ine&s;s,
for I did not well know what were the Ge|neral's
true Sentiments of this Attempt; but
I &s;oon found both that he had Courage and
a great deal of Genero&s;ity, and that he
was a mortal Enemy of &s;uch Violences as
the Souldiers were going to commit; for my
part, by the Grace of God, I thought my
&s;elf &s;trong enough not to need fear any thing,
and therefore made a firm Re&s;olution with
my &s;elf, rather to die a thou&s;and times if it
were po&s;&s;ible, than con&s;ent to any thing
that would be again&s;t the Glory of God, or
again&s;t the Service of his Catholick Maje&s;ty.
At the &s;ame time I went to celebrate the holy
Ma&s;s, and after I had done, I retir'd with my
Comrade, that we might con&s;ult together
by what means to hinder &s;o barbarous and

of this I&s;land.</HEAD>
<P>TWenty eight Leagues below the River
<HI>Cayari,</HI> as we continued our Cour&s;e on
the <HI>Amazone</HI> on the South-&s;ide, we arriv'd at
<PB N="156" REF="85">
a great I&s;land 60 Leagues in breadth, and
con&s;equently above 200 Leagues in compa&s;s.
This whole I&s;land is peopled with the va|liant
<HI>Toupinambous,</HI> who when <HI>Brazil</HI> was
conquer'd, voluntarily exil'd them&s;elves from
their Country, choo&s;ing rather to quit all the
Province of <HI>Fernambuco</HI> than to lo&s;e their
Liberty, and to &s;ubmit them&s;elves to the &s;e|vere
Government of the Portuguez: They
left above 84 great Villages where they had
planted them&s;elves, and came away &s;o uni|ver&s;ally,
that there was not one living Soul
left in all their Hou&s;es. They took their
way on the left-hand of tho&s;e great Moun|tains
call'd <HI>Cordeliers,</HI> which begin at the
Strait of <HI>Magellan,</HI> and cro&s;s through all
Southern <HI>America,</HI> from North to South.
They pa&s;s'd all the Rivulets and Rivers that
de&s;cend from tho&s;e Mountains to di&s;charge
them&s;elves into the Ocean. Some of 'em
came as far as <HI>Peru,</HI> and dwelt with the Spa|niards
towards the Source of the River <HI>Cay|ari:</HI>
they continued with 'em &s;ome time; but
a Spaniard having caus'd one of 'em to be
whipp'd for killing a Cow, they could not
put up this Injury, but re&s;olv'd all to be gone;
and making u&s;e of the Advantage of the Ri|ver,
they all embark'd in their Canoos and
went down it as far as this great I&s;land,
where they now dwell. They &s;peak the ge|neral
Language of <HI>Brazil,</HI> which extends
<PB N="157" REF="85">
through all the Country that the Portuguez
have conquer'd as far as <HI>Maragnon</HI> and <HI>Para:</HI>
They told us, that when their Fathers left
<HI>Brazil,</HI> not knowing how to get Su&s;tenance
all together in the De&s;arts through which
they were to pa&s;s, they were con&s;train'd du|ring
a March of above 900 Leagues to &s;epa|rate
by rea&s;on of their multitude, &s;o that
&s;ome went one way, and &s;ome another; and
by this means all the Mountains of <HI>Peru</HI> call'd
the <HI>Cordeliers</HI> are peopled with the <HI>Toupi|nambous.</HI>
This is a very brave and valiant
Nation of Indians, as they made them&s;elves
appear to be to the People whom they found
in this I&s;land, where they are at pre&s;ent e&s;ta|&s;tli&s;h'd.
For in all appearance the&s;e <HI>Toupi|nambous</HI>
were very few in compari&s;on of the
Inhabitants of this I&s;land when they arriv'd
there, yet 'tis certain they &s;o often beat, and
&s;o entirely &s;ubdued all tho&s;e they fought
with, that after they had de&s;troy'd whole
Nations, they forc'd the re&s;t to leave their
Native Country in fear, and to go and plant
them&s;elves in very di&s;tant Regions. The&s;e
Warlike Savages u&s;e Bows and Arrows with
great dexterity, and have &s;o noble a Courage,
and Greatne&s;s of Mind, that in the&s;e Quali|ties
they &s;eem not to come behind the mo&s;t
accompli&s;h'd Nations in <HI>Europe.</HI> But tho al|mo&s;t
all of 'em are but the Children or Grand|children
of tho&s;e that came from <HI>Brazil</HI> into
<PB N="158" REF="86">
this I&s;land, yet it is to be ob&s;erv'd that they
begin to degenerate from their Ance&s;tors, by
the Alliances they contract with tho&s;e of
this Country, and by their accu&s;toming them|&s;elves
to the manner of living us'd by the
original Inhabitants. They all receiv'd us
with Demon&s;trations of extraordinary Joy;
and let us know, that they thought to re|&s;olve
in a little time to enter into a Treaty
with us, and to put them&s;elves in the num|ber
of the Allies and Friends of the People
of <HI>Para.</HI> This Declaration of theirs pleas'd
me very much, and made me hope that no
&s;mall Advantages would accrue to our Na|tion
by it: For if the&s;e valiant People once
become of our Party, it mu&s;t needs be an

<P>THe&s;e <HI>Toupinambous</HI> are a very ingenious
and intelligent People; and having
no need of Interpreters to treat with them,

our Portuguez, that have been born and bred
there, &s;peak as well as they, we had the
Advantage of a very particular Account of
divers things, which I am going to relate,
and which may be believed on their Report,
becau&s;e they are a People that have rov'd a|broad,
and &s;ubjected all the neighbouring
Countries to their Power. They told us,
that on the South-&s;ide near their I&s;land there
are two Nations among others upon the Con|tinent
that are very remarkable; one of 'em
are Dwarfs as &s;mall as little Children, and
are called <HI>Guayazis,</HI> the other is a Race of
People that come into the World with their
Feet turn'd behind 'em, &s;o that tho&s;e that
are unacquainted with their mon&s;trous Shape,
and &s;hould follow their Track, would run
from 'em in&s;tead of overtaking 'em; they
are called <HI>Matayus,</HI> and are tributary to the
<HI>Toupinambous,</HI> whom they are obliged to
furni&s;h with Hatchets made of Stone to fell
great Trees with, when they have a mind to
clear a Piece of Ground; for they frame
the&s;e Hatchets very neatly, and 'tis their
whole bu&s;ine&s;s to make of 'em. They told
us moreover, that on the other &s;ide of the
River, that is Northward, there are &s;even
Provinces adjoining one to another, which are
very populous; but becau&s;e they are a Peo|ple
<PB N="160" REF="87">
but of mean Courage and Strength, and
only feed upon Fruits and &s;ome &s;mall wild
Animals, without ever fighting one with a|nother
when they are angry, or ever taking
up Arms to defend them&s;elves from other
Nations, they are of no account in the Coun|try.
They further told us, that them&s;elves
had been a long time at Peace with another
Nation, who&s;e Confines extend to tho&s;e we
have ju&s;t &s;poken of, and had a regular Trade
with 'em for all Commodities, wherewith
either Countrey abounded; and that the
principal thing they had from this People
was Salt, for which they gave 'em other
things in exchange; and that this Salt came
from a Place not far di&s;tant from 'em. If this
be true, the&s;e Salt-pits would be of great
advantage to the Spaniards, and would &s;erve
'em not only for tho&s;e parts of the Countrey
that are conquer'd, but al&s;o for the more
commodious e&s;tabli&s;hing of Colonies on the
Banks of this great River. But if there
&s;hould be nothing in this Story on this &s;ide,
it is not to be doubted but Salt is to be found
in great abundance along tho&s;e Rivers that
come down on the &s;ide of <HI>Peru;</HI> becau&s;e in
the Year 1631, when I was in the City of
<HI>Lima,</HI> two Men went from thence at two
different times to &s;eek &s;ome, and came back
with as much as they could carry: they told
us they came to a certain Place, where they
<PB N="161" REF="87">
went on one of the Rivers (in all appearance
one of tho&s;e le&s;&s;er Rivers that form that great
one, which falls into the <HI>Amazone</HI>) and arrived
at a Mountain all of Salt, of which the Inhabi|tants
made great advantage, being become ve|ry
rich by the Traffick they had in exchange
for it from tho&s;e Indians that came a great
way to buy it; not that it is any &s;trange thing
in <HI>Peru,</HI> and in all the Mountains, to &s;ee
Rocks of Salt-&s;tones, the Salt of which is
very good; for no other is made u&s;e of in all

made by the Authority of the Soveraign Court
of <HI>Quito,</HI> in which many Witne&s;&s;es have been
heard that have been born in tho&s;e Parts,
and liv'd there a long time; and of all things
contain'd in their Frontier Countries, one of
the principal which is particularly affirm'd
<PB N="163" REF="88">
by 'em is, that one of tho&s;e Provinces near

times live together in their Towns, and im|ploy
them&s;elves in manuring the Ground,

their Arrows with &s;o &s;ubtile a Poi&s;on,

All things were in this po&s;ture when we ar|rived

endeavour'd by the be&s;t Methods I could
take, at lea&s;t to &s;u&s;pend the execution of it

with my own Eyes: This Prey was very

excited their Avarice, that they &s;oon made

of the Country, and the great
Riches they draw from thence, but then
I was at a lo&s;s how to bring it about,
becau&s;e 'tis very difficult for a Stranger,
to get into tho&s;e Parts; but there hap|pen'd
a conjuncture which favour'd my

proceed in it, in the manner follow|ing.</P>
<P>In the Year 1654, <HI>Oliver Cromwell</HI> at
that time Protector of the Common|wealth

the Coa&s;ts of <HI>Algarve</HI> and <HI>Anda|lou&s;ia,</HI>
to wait for the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Gal|lions
which come yearly from the <HI>Indies.</HI>
The <HI>Spaniards</HI> being advertis'd of it, re|&s;olv'd
to equip a Fleet with all expedi|tion
to oppo&s;e the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and fru&s;trate
their de&s;ign: To this end they &s;et out
28 Men of War and 6 Fire&s;hips, under
the Command of <HI>Don Paul de Contreras,</HI>
who&s;e Vice-Admiral was the <HI>Amirante
Ca&s;tana,</HI> on board whom was I. The
Two Fleets came up with each other,
near <HI>Cape St. Vincent,</HI> where they &s;taid
many Days; but the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> perceiving
<PB N="3" REF="110">
they were like to make nothing on't, re|tir'd
towards <HI>Lisbon,</HI> and the <HI>Spaniards</HI>
&s;tood into <HI>Cadiz,</HI> where all the Gallions
&s;afely arriv'd in the beginning of the
Year 1655, except the Vice-Admiral,
which was lo&s;t in the Channel of <HI>Bahama</HI>
upon the Coa&s;ts of <HI>Florida.</HI> Sometime af|ter
this, the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> having declar'd War
again&s;t the <HI>Spaniards</HI> more openly, by
taking <HI>Jamaica,</HI> the Navigation to the
<HI>We&s;t-Indies</HI> was a long time interrupted,
by their Crui&s;ers hovering about <HI>Cadiz&punc;</HI>

&s;ome Ships coming from the <HI>Indies</HI> rich|ly
laden, took one of the bigge&s;t, burnt
Two others, and put the re&s;t to flight,
and afterwards went to the <HI>Canaries,</HI>
where they burnt mo&s;t of the Flota that
were arriv'd there from <HI>New Spain,</HI> and
waited orders from <HI>Madrid,</HI> what cour&s;e
to take to e&s;cape falling into the hands of
the <HI>Engli&s;h.</HI> While the&s;e things were do|ing,
the <HI>Dutch</HI> who &s;ought to make their
advantage of the Troubles that the <HI>Spa|niards</HI>
were embroil'd in, &s;ent &s;everal
Ships to the River <HI>de la Plata,</HI> laden
with Goods and <HI>Negroes,</HI> which they
took in at <HI>Angola</HI> and <HI>Congo:</HI> The&s;e
Ships being arriv'd in that River, and
come up to <HI>Buenos Ayres,</HI> the Inhabi|tants
<PB N="4" REF="111">
of the place who had a long time
been depriv'd of the Supplies which
they had us'd to receive by the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI>
Gallions (who were hinder'd by the
<HI>Engli&s;h</HI> from making their con&s;tant Voy|ages)
and were be&s;ides in want of <HI>Ne|groes</HI>
and other things, wrought &s;o far
upon the Governor, that for a Pre&s;ent
which they oblig'd the <HI>Hollanders</HI> to give
him, and &s;atisfying the Cu&s;toms due to
the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> they were permitted
to Land and Trade there.</P>
<P>Mean time the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Mini&s;ters (ap|prehending
le&s;t the Interruption of the
Commerce, and the &s;carcity of <HI>European</HI>
Commodities in tho&s;e Parts, might con|&s;train
the Inhabitants to Traffick with
Strangers (which 'tis their Intere&s;t to
prevent as much as they can) thought
fit to grant Licences to &s;everal of their

their own proper ri&s;que. A certain
Cavalier took one of them, and fitted
out a Ship at <HI>Cadiz,</HI> where I abode at
that time; I re&s;olv'd to go in her, and
that the more willingly, becau&s;e I had
formerly had &s;ome dealings with him.
He very friendly con&s;ented to let me go
under his Name for his Nephew, that I
might conceal my being a Forreigner,
<PB N="5" REF="111">
which if known would have &s;topt my
Voyage, becau&s;e in <HI>Spain</HI> they allow
none but Native <HI>Spaniards</HI> to go in their
Ships to the <HI>Indies.</HI> We &s;et Sail about
the latter end of <HI>December</HI> 1657, in a
Ship of 450 Tuns, and in 105 Days
reach'd the Mouth of the River <HI>de la
Plata,</HI> where we met a <HI>French</HI> Frigat,
Captain <HI>Foran</HI> Commander, and fought
her &s;ome time, we got clear of her, and
continued our Cour&s;e till we came be|fore
<HI>Buenos Ayres,</HI> where we found 22
<HI>Dutch</HI> Ships, and among them 2 <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI>
Laden homewards with Bulls-hides,
Plate, and <HI>Spani&s;h</HI>-wool, which they
had receiv'd in exchange for their Com|modities;
a few days after 3 <HI>Dutch</HI>
Ships going out of the Road encounter'd
Captain <HI>Foran</HI> and another Frigat, nam'd
the <HI>Mare&s;chale,</HI> Commanded by the Che|valier

the <HI>Hollanders</HI> boarded and took
the <HI>Mare&s;chale,</HI> put all her Men to
the Sword, and the Chevalier among the

<P>This accident alarum'd tho&s;e of <HI>Beue|nos

upon their guard, imagining there was a
<HI>French</HI> Squadron come into the River to
make an attempt upon their Country.
<PB N="6" REF="112">
Whereupon they re&s;olv'd to &s;end for

under the Command of <HI>Don Seba&s;ti|an
Comacho.</HI></P>
<P>But before I proceed further, 'tis fit I
deliver my Ob&s;ervations concerning the
River <HI>de la Plata,</HI> and the Countries
through which it runs. In tho&s;e Parts
'tis call'd the <HI>Paraguay,</HI> but more vulgar|ly
the Great <HI>Parana;</HI> probably, becau&s;e
the River of <HI>Parana</HI> falls into it above
the Town <HI>de las Corrientes.</HI> 'Its Mouth
(which lies in the 35th. Degree of <HI>Sou|thern
Latitude,</HI> on that &s;ide the <HI>Equinocti|al
Line</HI>) is between <HI>Cape de Ca&s;tillos</HI> and
<HI>Cape de Sant Antonio,</HI> about 80 Leagues
di&s;tant from each, Tho' it be deep e|nough
every where, yet the commone&s;t
Road into it, and mo&s;t us'd by Sailors
is on the North-&s;ide, from <HI>Ca&s;tillos</HI> to
<HI>Montvidio,</HI> which is half-way to <HI>Buenos
Ayres,</HI> and notwith&s;tanding there is a
Channel on the &s;ame North-&s;ide from
<HI>Montvidio</HI> to <HI>Buenos Ayres,</HI> the &s;hallow|e&s;t
place in which is Three Fathom deep,
<PB N="7" REF="112">
yet for more &s;ecurity they cro&s;s over a|gain&s;t
<HI>Monvidio</HI> into the South Channel,
becau&s;e 'tis broader and has Three Fa|thom
and a half Water at lea&s;t where
'tis &s;hallowe&s;t; all the bottom is muddy
till within 2 Leagues of <HI>Buenos Ayres</HI>
where lyes a &s;and Bank, there they take
in Pilots to Steer them to a place call'd
the <HI>Po&s;&s;o</HI> ju&s;t before the Town, di&s;tant
a Cannon &s;hot from Shore, wherein no
Ve&s;&s;els may enter but &s;uch as have a Li|cence
from the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> tho&s;e that
have no &s;uch permi&s;&s;ion are oblig'd to
Anchor a League Lower. The River is
full of Fi&s;h, but of them there are hard|ly
more than Seven or Eight &s;orts good
to eat, there are abundance of tho&s;e
Whales call'd <HI>Gibars,</HI> and Sea-dogs who
commonly bring forth their young a|&s;hore,
and who&s;e Skin is fit for &s;everal
u&s;es. I was told that about 5 or 6 Years be|fore
I came there, the River was almo&s;t
dry'd up for &s;ome days, no Water be|ing
left but only in the middle Channel,
and there &s;o little, that they forded it
on Hor&s;eback, as one may do mo&s;t of
the Rivers that fall into that <HI>de la Plata,</HI>
in which there are likewi&s;e a great ma|ny
<HI>Otters,</HI> with who&s;e Skins the Savages
Cloath them&s;elves.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="113">
The Country on the North-&s;ide of
the River <HI>de la Plata</HI> is of great extent,
Inhabited by none but Savages, call'd
<HI>Charuas;</HI> mo&s;t of the little I&s;lands that
lie all along the River, and the Shore
&s;ides are cover'd with Woods full of
Wild Boars. From <HI>Cape de Ca&s;tillos</HI> up
to <HI>Rio Negro,</HI> as well as from the &s;ame
<HI>Cape</HI> to <HI>San Paulo</HI> bordering upon <HI>Bra|&s;il;</HI>
the Coa&s;ts are uninhabited, tho' the
Country, e&s;pecially along the River
&s;eems to be very good, having little Ri|vulets
running down from the Hills thro'
the Plains. The <HI>Spaniards</HI> &s;ettled fir&s;t
there, but afterwards remov'd to <HI>Buenos
Ayres,</HI> becau&s;e 'twas trouble&s;om to cro&s;s
over the great <HI>Parana</HI> to go to <HI>Peru.</HI></P>
<P>I went a&s;hore frequently beyond <HI>Rio
Negro,</HI> but never farther than Three
quarters of a League into the Land,
there are but few Savages to be &s;een, and
they have their Habitations a good way
up in the Country; tho&s;e I met with
were well made, with long Hair and
very little Beard; they wear nothing but
a great Skin, made of little ones patch'd
together, that hangs down to their heels,
and a piece of Leather under their Feet,
ty'd with Straps about their Ankles. For
Ornament they bind a Fillet of &s;ome
<PB N="9" REF="113">
Stuff about their Heads, which comes o|ver
the Fore-head, and keeps the Hair
back behind. The Women have no o|ther
Garment but the&s;e Skins, which
they gird about their Wa&s;tes, and co|ver
their heads with a &s;ort of little Hats
made of Ru&s;hes of divers Colours.</P>
<P>From <HI>Rio Negro</HI> to <HI>Las Corrientes</HI> and
the River of <HI>Parana,</HI> the Country is
well &s;tockt with Bulls and Cows, there
are likewi&s;e a great many Stags, who&s;e
Skins they &s;ell for right Buff. The Sa|vages
about <HI>Rio Negro</HI> are the only Peo|ple
from the Sea thither, that keep Cor|re&s;pondence
with tho&s;e of <HI>Buenos Ayres,</HI>
and the <HI>Ca&s;iques,</HI> and <HI>Couracas</HI> their Lea|ders
do Hommage to the Governor of
that Place, from whence they are but
about 20 Leagues di&s;tant. One of the
chief <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Towns on that &s;ide is <HI>Las
Siete Corrientes,</HI> Situate near the place
where the Two Rivers <HI>Paraguay</HI> and <HI>Pa|rana</HI>
meet. Upon the <HI>Parana</HI> &s;tand
Three or Four Villages pretty far from
each other, and thinly Peopled, tho'
the Country be very proper for Vine-yards,
and has enough planted already
to &s;upply the Neighbouring Parts with
Wine. The Inhabitants are under the
Juri&s;diction of a Governour re&s;ident at
<PB N="10" REF="114">
<HI>A&s;&s;omption,</HI> which is the mo&s;t important
Place the <HI>Spaniards</HI> have in that Coun|try,
and &s;tands higher up the River <HI>Pa|raguay</HI>
on the North-&s;ide; 'tis the Metra|politan
City, a Bi&s;hop's Seat, has &s;eve|ral
very neat Churches and Convents,
and is well crowded with Inhabitants,
becau&s;e a great many Idle People, and
&s;uch as have run out their Fortunes and
can live no longer in <HI>Spain</HI> or <HI>Peru,</HI>
flock thither as to their la&s;t refuge. The
Land abounds in Corn, Millet, Sugar,
Tobacco, Honey, Cattle, Oaks fit for
Shipping, Pine-Trees for Ma&s;ts, and
particularly in that Herb, call'd, the
<HI>Herb of Paraguay,</HI> which they drive a
great Trade in all over the <HI>We&s;t-Indies;</HI>
and this obliges the Merchants of <HI>Chili</HI>
and <HI>Peru,</HI> to hold a Corre&s;pondence
with tho&s;e of <HI>Paraguay;</HI> becau&s;e, with|out
that Herb (with which they make a
refre&s;hing Liquor with Water and Su|gar,
to be drank lukewarm) the Inhabi|tants
of <HI>Peru,</HI> Savages and others, e&s;pe|cially
tho&s;e that work in the Mines, could
not &s;ub&s;i&s;t, for the Soil of the Country
being full of Mineral Veins, the Vapours
that ri&s;e out of the Ground &s;uffocate
them, and nothing but that Liquor can
recover them again, which revives and
<PB N="11" REF="114">
re&s;tores them to their former Vi|gour.</P>
<P>In this City of <HI>A&s;&s;omption,</HI> the Native
<HI>Indians,</HI> as well as <HI>Spaniards</HI> are very
courteous and obliging to Strangers.
They indulge them&s;elves in a great deal
of liberty, even with re&s;pect to Women,
in&s;omuch that being often nece&s;&s;itated
to Sleep in the open Air (becau&s;e of the
exce&s;&s;ive Heat) they &s;pread their Quilts
in the Streets, and lie there all Night
Men and Women together: Nor is any
Body &s;candaliz'd at it. Having plenty of
all things good to eat and drink, they
give them&s;elves up to Ea&s;e and Idlene&s;s,
and don't much trouble them&s;elves with
Trading abroad, nor heaping up Money,
which upon that account is very &s;carce
among 'em, contenting them&s;elves with
trucking the Commodities of their own
Product, for others more nece&s;&s;ary and
u&s;eful to them.</P>
<P>Further up in the Country, that is to
&s;ay, towards the Head of the River <HI>&V;ru|gay,</HI>
in the Province of <HI>Paraguay,</HI> are ma|ny
Settlements of Colonies, tran&s;plant|ed
thither by the <HI>Je&s;uits Mi&s;&s;ionaries,</HI>
that prevail'd upon the Savages in tho&s;e
Parts, who are naturally tractable, to
quit their Woods and Mountains, and
<PB N="12" REF="115">
come and dwell together in Villages in
a Civil Community, where they in|&s;tructed
them in the Chri&s;tian Religion,
taught them Mechanicks, to play upon
Mu&s;ical In&s;truments, and &s;everal other
Arts covenient to Human Life. <HI>Thus
the Mi&s;&s;ionaries who came upon a Religi|ous
Motive, are largely recompenc'd by
the Temporal Advantages which they reap
here.</HI> The report that there were Golden
Mines in this Country, could not be
kept &s;o clo&s;e, but that the <HI>Spaniards</HI> had
&s;ome inkling of it, and among others,
<HI>Don Hiacinto de Laris</HI> Governor of <HI>Bue|nes
Ayres,</HI> who about the Year 1653, had
orders from the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> to go
and vi&s;it the&s;e Settlements, and examine
into their Wealth. At fir&s;t coming he
was well receiv'd, but perceiving that
he began to in&s;pect their Riches, and
&s;earch for Gold, The Savages who are
&s;hy of working in the Mines, took up
Arms, and forc'd him and his Followers
Fifty in Number to depart out of their
Country. The Governor who &s;ucceeded
him, inform'd him&s;elf more particularly
of this matter, and to make the be&s;t u&s;e
of his Intelligence, inter'd into a &s;trict
Alliance with the <HI>Je&s;uits</HI> of his own
Government, who hold a Corre&s;pon|dence
<PB N="13" REF="115">
with the re&s;t of their Fraternity;
and having got a con&s;iderable Sum from
the <HI>Hollanders</HI> for leave to Trade at
<HI>Buenos Ayres,</HI> he engag'd the <HI>Je&s;uits</HI> to
furni&s;h him 100000 Crowns in Gold for
the value in Silver, for lightne&s;s of Car|riage.
But this &s;ame Governor being
arre&s;ted by the King of <HI>Spain</HI>'s Order,
for permitting the <HI>Dutch</HI> to Trade at
<HI>Buenos Ayres,</HI> his Gold was &s;eiz'd and
confi&s;cated, which upon trial prov'd to
be much finer than that of <HI>Peru,</HI> and by
this and other Circum&s;tances, they di&s;|cover'd,
that it came from the Mines
found out by the <HI>Je&s;uits</HI> in the&s;e parts.</P>
<P>On the South-&s;ide of the River <HI>de la
Plata,</HI> from <HI>Cape Sant Antonio,</HI> to within
30 Leagues of <HI>Buenos Ayres,</HI> 'tis dange|rous
Sailing, becau&s;e of the Banks that
lie in the way; wherefore they always
go on the North-&s;ide, as I &s;aid before,
till they come up &s;o far, then they cro&s;s
over to the South-&s;ide which is very &s;afe;
e&s;pecially when the Wind blows again&s;t
the Stream of the River and &s;wells it;
for when a We&s;terly Wind blows from
Land, the Water falls; however when
the Water is at the lowe&s;t, 'tis Three
Fathom and a half deep, both in the
North and South Channels. When we
<PB N="14" REF="116">
enter'd into the South-Channel, we came
in &s;ight of tho&s;e Va&s;t Plains extending to
<HI>Buenos Ayres,</HI> and thence as far as the
River <HI>Salladillo,</HI> 60 Leagues &s;hort of
<HI>Cordoua,</HI> which are &s;o cover'd with all
&s;orts of Cattle, that notwith&s;tanding
multitudes of them are daily de&s;troy'd
for their Skins, there's no Sign of their
diminution.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as we arriv'd at the <HI>Cape</HI> of
<HI>Buenos Ayres,</HI> we gave notice of it to
the Governor, who under&s;tanding that
we had the King of <HI>Spain</HI>'s Licence for
coming thither, (without which he
could not have permitted us entrance in|to
the place, unle&s;s he would have broke
his Orders) he &s;ent the Kings Officers
on board to vi&s;it our Ship, according to
cu&s;tom, which done, we landed our
Goods, and laid them up in a Ware|hou&s;e
hired for the time of our &s;tay.
They con&s;i&s;ted chiefly in Linnen Cloath,
particularly that made at <HI>Rouen,</HI> which
goes off very well in tho&s;e Parts, as al|&s;o
in Silks, Ribans, Thread, Needles,
Swords, Hor&s;e-&s;hoes, and other Iron-work,
Working-tools of all &s;orts, Drugs,
Spices, Silk and Wollen-Stockings,
Woollen-Cloath, Serges, and other
Woollen-Stuffs, and generally in every
<PB N="15" REF="116">
thing fit for Cloathing: which as we
were inform'd were proper commodities
for tho&s;e Parts. Now the Cu&s;tom is,
that as &s;oon as a Licens'd Ship (that is
to &s;ay which has the King of <HI>Spain</HI>'s
Permi&s;&s;ion) comes to <HI>Buenos Ayres.</HI> The
Governor of the Place, or Captain of
the Ship di&s;patches a Me&s;&s;enger to <HI>Peru,</HI>
with the Letters from <HI>Spain,</HI> if he has
any; or el&s;e to acquaint the Merchants
with his Arrival, whereupon &s;ome of
them immediately &s;et out to <HI>Buenos Ay|res,</HI>
or el&s;e &s;end Commi&s;&s;ions to their
Corre&s;pondents, to buy up what Wares
they think convenient. 'Twas my for|tune
to be &s;ent upon both the&s;e Errands,
for among a great many Letters that
we brought with us, was a large pac|quet
from his Catholick Maje&s;ty for
<HI>Peru,</HI> enclos'd in a Leaden Box, as all the
Di&s;patches from the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Court to the
<HI>Indies</HI> commonly are; to the end, that if
the Ship that carries them &s;hould be in
eminent peril of falling into an Ene|mies
Hands, they might be flung over
board and &s;unk. This Pacquet was
entru&s;ted to my care, wherein were
many Letters to the Vice-Roy of <HI>Pe|ru,</HI>
and other Prime Officers in tho&s;e
Parts, &s;ignifying the Birth of the Prince
<PB N="16" REF="117">
of <HI>Spain:</HI> and I carry'd likewi&s;e an
Inventory atte&s;ted by the Kings Officers
at <HI>Buenos Ayres</HI> of the greate&s;t part of
our Lading, to be &s;hewn to the Mer|chants
of <HI>Poto&s;i;</HI> they rely'd upon the
conditions of the Goods as &s;pecified in
the Inventory, and &s;o bargain'd for what
they lik'd, but their effects did not come
to 'em till Seven or Eight Months af|ter.</P>

<HEAD>A De&s;cription of Buenos Ayres.</HEAD>
<P>BEfore I &s;ay any thing of my Journy
to <HI>Peru,</HI> I will &s;et down what I ob|&s;erv'd
remarkable at <HI>Buenos Ayres</HI> whil&s;t
I tarry'd there. The Air is pretty tem|perate,
much as 'tis in <HI>Andalou&s;ia,</HI> but
not quite &s;o warm, the Rains fall almo&s;t
as often in Summer as Winter; and the
Rain in &s;ultry weather u&s;ually breeds
divers kinds of Toads, which are very
common in this Country, but are not
venemous. The Town &s;tands upon a
ri&s;ing Ground on the &s;ide of the River
<HI>de la Plata,</HI> a Mu&s;quet &s;hot from the
Channel, in an Angle of Land made
<PB N="17" REF="117">
by a little Rivulet, call'd <HI>Riochuelo,</HI>
which falls into the River a quarter of
a League from the Town; it contains
400 Hou&s;es, has no enclo&s;ure, neither
Wall nor Ditch, and nothing to defend
it but a little Fort of Earth &s;urrounded
with a Ditch, which commands the Ri|ver,
and has Ten Iron Guns, the bigge&s;t
of which is a Twelve Pounder; there
the Governor re&s;ides who has but 150
Men in Garri&s;on, which are form'd into
Three Companies Commanded by Three
Captains, whom he appoints at will, and
indeed he changes them &s;o often, that
there is hardly a Wealthy Citizen but has
been a Captain; the&s;e Companies are not
always full, becau&s;e the Souldiers are
drawn by the cheapne&s;s of Living in
tho&s;e Parts to de&s;ert frequently, not|with&s;tanding
they endeavour to keep
them in the Service by a large pay, which
is <HI>per diem</HI> Four Reals, worth 1 <HI>s. 6 d.
Engli&s;h,</HI> and a Loaf of 3 <HI>d. ob.</HI> which
is as much as one Man can eat. But the
Governor keeps 1200 tame Hor&s;es in a
Plain thereabouts for his ordinary Ser|vice,
and in ca&s;e of nece&s;&s;ity to mount
the Inhabitants of the Place, and form
a &s;mall Body of Cavalry. Be&s;ides this
Fort, there is a little Ba&s;tion at the
<PB N="18" REF="118">
Mouth of the Rivulet wherein they
keep Guard, there are but Two Iron-Guns
mounted upon it, each carrying a
Three Pound Ball; this commands the
place where the Barks come a&s;hore to de|liver
or take in goods, which are liable
to be vi&s;ited by the Officers of the Ba|&s;tion
when they lade and unlade. The
Hou&s;es of the Town are built of Earth,
becau&s;e there is but little Stone in all
tho&s;e Parts up as far as <HI>Peru;</HI> they are
thatch'd with Canes and Straw, have
no Stories, all the Rooms are of
a Floor, and are very Spacious; they
have great Court-yards, and behind
their Hou&s;es large Gardens full of
Orange-trees, Lemon-trees, Fig-trees,
Apple-trees, Pear-trees, and other Fruit-trees,
with &s;tore of Herbs, Cabbages,
Onions, Garlick, Lettice, Peas, Beans,
and e&s;pecially their Melons are excellent,
the Soil being very fat and good; they
live very commodiou&s;ly, and except
Wine, which is &s;omething dear; they
have plenty of all &s;orts of Victuals, as
Beef, Veal, Mutton, Veni&s;on, Hares,
Coneys, Pullets, Ducks, Wild-gee&s;e,
Partridges, Pidgeons, Turtles, and all
kind of Wild-fowl; and &s;o cheap, that
one may buy Partridges for a Penny a
<PB N="19" REF="118">
piece, and the re&s;t proportionably.
There are likewi&s;e abundance of O&s;triches
who herd in Flocks like Cattle, and tho'
they are good Meat, yet none but the
Savages eat of them. They make Um|brellas
of their Feathers, which are very
commodious in the Sun; their Eggs are
good, and every body eats of 'em, tho'
they &s;ay they are of hard Dige&s;tion. I
&s;aw one thing of the&s;e Creatures very
remarkable, and that is, while the Hen
&s;its upon the Eggs, they have the In&s;tinct
or Fore&s;ight to provide for their Young;
&s;o five or &s;ix days before they come out
of the Shell, they &s;et an Egg in each of
the four Corners of the place where they
&s;it, the&s;e Eggs they break, and when they
rot, Worms and Maggots breed in 'em
in prodigious numbers, which &s;erve to
nouri&s;h the Young O&s;triches from the
time they are hatch'd till they are able to
go farther for their &s;u&s;tenance. The
Hou&s;es of the better &s;ort of Inhabitants
are adorn'd with Hangings, Pictures,
and other Ornaments and decent Movea|bles,
and all that are tollerably well to
pa&s;s are &s;erv'd in Plate, and have a
great many Servants, <HI>Blacks, Moulatos,
Me&s;tices, Indians, Cabres,</HI> or <HI>Sambos,</HI>
who are all Slaves. The <HI>Negroes</HI> come
<PB N="20" REF="119">
from <HI>Guinea;</HI> the <HI>Moulatos</HI> are begotten
by a <HI>Spaniard</HI> upon a <HI>Black;</HI> the <HI>Me&s;ti|ces</HI>
are born of a <HI>Spaniard</HI> and an <HI>Indian,</HI>
and the <HI>Sambos</HI> of an <HI>Indian</HI> Man and a
<HI>Me&s;tice,</HI> all di&s;tingui&s;hable by their Co|lour
and Hair. They employ the&s;e
Slaves in their Hou&s;es, or to cultivate
their Grounds, for they have large Farms
&s;tock'd with Grain in abundance, as
Wheat, Barley and Millet, or to look
after their Hor&s;es and Mules, who feed
upon nothing but Gra&s;s all the Year
round, or to kill Wild-Bulls, or in fine
to do any kind of Service. All the Wealth
of the&s;e Inhabitants con&s;i&s;ts in Cattle,
wich multiply &s;o prodigiou&s;ly in this
Province, that the Plains are quite co|ver'd
with 'em, particularly with Bulls,
Cows, Sheep, Hor&s;es, Mares, Mules, A&s;|&s;es,
Swine, Deer, and others, in&s;omuch
that were it not for a va&s;t number of
Dogs, who devour the Calves and other
young Bea&s;ts, they would over-run the
Country, they make &s;o great profit of
the Skins and Hides of the&s;e Annimals,
that a &s;ingle In&s;tance will be &s;ufficient to
&s;hew how far it might be improv'd by
good hands: The 22 <HI>Dutch</HI> Ships that
we found at <HI>Buenos Ayres</HI> were each of
them laden with 13 or 14000 Bull-hides
<PB N="21" REF="119">
at lea&s;t, which amount to above 300000
<HI>Livers,</HI> or 33500 <HI>l. Sterling,</HI> bought by
the <HI>Dutch</HI> at Seven or Eight <HI>Reals</HI> a
piece, that is under an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Crown, and
&s;old again in <HI>Europe</HI> for Twenty-five
Shillings <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> at lea&s;t. When I expre&s;s'd
my a&s;toni&s;hment at the &s;ight of &s;uch
an infinite number of Cattle, they told
me of a Stratagem &s;ometimes made u&s;e
of, when they apprehend a de&s;cent from
any Enemies, that is matter of greater
wonder, and 'tis this; they drive &s;uch
a Herd of Bulls, Cows, Hor&s;es and other
Animals to the Shore-&s;ide, that 'tis utter|ly
impo&s;&s;ible for any number of Men,
even tho' they &s;hould not dread the fu|ry
of tho&s;e Wild Creatures, to make
their way through &s;o great a drove of
Bea&s;ts. The Fir&s;t Inhabitants of this
place, put every one their mark upon
tho&s;e they could catch, and turn'd 'em
into their enclo&s;ures, but they multiply'd
&s;o fa&s;t, that they were forc'd to let 'em
loo&s;e, and now they go and kill them
according as they want 'em, or have oc|ca&s;ion
to make up a quantity of Hides
for Sale. At pre&s;ent they mark only
tho&s;e Hor&s;es and Mules which they catch
to tame and breed up for Service. Some
Per&s;ons make a great Trade of &s;ending
<PB N="22" REF="120">
them to <HI>Peru,</HI> where they yield 50 <HI>Pata|gons,</HI>
or 11 <HI>l. 13 s. 4 d. Sterling</HI> a pair.
Mo&s;t of the Dealers in Cattle are very
Rich, but of all the Trading People the
mo&s;t con&s;iderable are they that Traf|fick
in <HI>European</HI> Commodities. Ma|ny
of whom are reputed worth 2 or
300000 Crowns, or 67000 <HI>l. Sterling.</HI>
So that a Merchant worth no more than
15 or 20000 Crowns is look'd upon as
a mean Retailer; of the&s;e la&s;t there are
near 200 Families in the Town, that
make 500 Men bearing Arms, be&s;ides
their Slaves who are three times that
Number, but are not to be reckon'd of
any Defence, becau&s;e they are not al|low'd
to bear Arms: Thus the <HI>Spaniards,
Portugue&s;e,</HI> and their Sons (of whom
tho&s;e that are born upon the place are
term'd <HI>Criolos,</HI> to di&s;tingui&s;h them from
the Natives of <HI>Spain</HI>) and &s;ome <HI>Me&s;tices</HI>
are the Militia, which with the Souldiers
in Garri&s;on, compo&s;e a Body of above
600 Men, as I computed them in &s;everal
Mu&s;ters, for they draw out on Hor&s;e-back
Three times a Year near the Town
on Fe&s;tival Days. I ob&s;erv'd there were
many Old Men among them that did not
carry Fire-arms, but only a Sword by
their &s;ide, a Lance in hand, and a Buck|ler

them to loo&s;en the Sacred Knot: But
then if their Husbands tran&s;gre&s;s, they
are often puni&s;h'd with Poi&s;on or Dag|ger.
The Women are more in Number
than the Men. Be&s;ides <HI>Spaniards,</HI> there are
a few <HI>French, Hollanders,</HI> and <HI>Genoue&s;e,</HI>
but all go for <HI>Spaniards,</HI> otherwi&s;e there

<HEAD>Mon&s;ieur Acarete du Bi&s;cay's Jour|ney
from Buenos Ayres to Peru.</HEAD>
<P>I Left <HI>Buenos Ayres,</HI> and took the Road
to <HI>Cordoua,</HI> leaving <HI>Santa Fe</HI> on my
right hand, of which place take this ac|count,
'tis a <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Settlement dependant
upon <HI>Buenos Ayres,</HI> the Commander is
no more than a Lieutenant, and does no|thing
but by order from the Governor
of <HI>Buenos Ayres.</HI> 'Tis a little place con|taining
25 Hou&s;es, without any Walls,
Fortifications, or Garri&s;on, di&s;tant 80
Leagues from <HI>Buenos Ayres</HI> Northward,
Situate upon the River <HI>de la Plata,</HI> large
Ve&s;&s;els might come up to it, were it not
for a great bank that ob&s;tructs the pa&s;|&s;age
a little above <HI>Buenos Ayres.</HI> Ne|verthele&s;s
'tis a very advantageous Po&s;t,
becau&s;e 'tis the only pa&s;&s;age from <HI>Peru,
Chili</HI> and <HI>Tucuman</HI> to <HI>Paraguay,</HI> and in a
manner the Magazine of the Commodi|ties
<PB N="25" REF="121">
drawn from thence, particularly that
Herb already &s;poken of, which they
cannot be without in tho&s;e Provinces.
The Soil is as good and Fertile here as
at <HI>Buenos Ayres;</HI> and the Town having
nothing remarkably different from what
has been ob&s;erv'd of <HI>Buenos Ayres,</HI> I
leave it, and proceed upon my Jour|ney.
'Tis counted 140 Leagues from
<HI>Buenos Ayres</HI> to <HI>Cordoua,</HI> and becau&s;e
&s;ome parts of the Road are uninhabited
for a long way together; I furni&s;hed
my &s;elf at my departure with what I
was inform'd I &s;hould &s;tand in need
of; &s;o I &s;et out having a Savage for my
Guide, with Three Hor&s;es and Three
Mules, &s;ome to carry my Baggage, and
the re&s;t to change upon the way when
that I rid upon was tired.</P>
<P>From <HI>Buenos Ayres,</HI> to the River <HI>Lu|can,</HI>
and even as far as the River <HI>Recife,</HI>
30 Leagues, I pa&s;s'd by &s;everal Habita|tions
and Farms cultivated by the <HI>Spani|ards,</HI>
but beyond <HI>Recife</HI> to the River
<HI>Salladillo,</HI> I &s;aw none. Let it be ob&s;er|ved
by the way, that the&s;e Rivers as well
as all the re&s;t in the Provinces of <HI>Buenos
Ayres, Paraguay</HI> and <HI>Tucuman,</HI> that fall
into the River <HI>de la Plata</HI> are fordable
on Hor&s;e-back; but when the Rains or
<PB N="26" REF="122">
any other accident &s;wells them, a Tra|veller
mu&s;t either &s;wim over, or el&s;e get
upon a bundle in the nature of a raft,
which a Savage hawls over to the other
&s;ide. I could not Swim, and &s;o was
forc'd to make u&s;e of this expedient
twice or thrice when I could not find a
Ford. The way was this, my <HI>Indian</HI>
kill'd a Wild Bull, flead the Hide off,
&s;tuffed it with &s;traw, and ty'd it up in
a great bundle with thongs of the &s;ame
Hide, upon which I plac'd my &s;elf with
my Baggage; he &s;wam over hawling me
after him by a Cord ty'd to the bundle,
and then he repa&s;s'd and &s;wam my Hor&s;es
and Mules over to me.</P>
<P>All the Country between the River
<HI>Recife</HI> and <HI>Salladillo,</HI> tho' uninhabited,
abounds in Cattle and all &s;orts of Fruit-trees,
except Walnut and Che&s;nut-trees;
there are whole Woods of Nectarine-Trees,
Three or Four Leagues in compa&s;s,
that bear excellent Fruit, which they
not only eat raw, but bake them, or dry
them in the Sun, to keep, as we in <HI>France</HI>
do Prunes: They &s;eldom u&s;e any other
than the Wood of this Tree for common
firing at <HI>Buenos Ayres,</HI> and thereabouts.
The Savages that dwell in the&s;e Parts are
di&s;tingui&s;h'd into two &s;orts, tho&s;e that
<PB N="27" REF="122">
voluntarily &s;ubmit to the <HI>Spaniards</HI> are
call'd <HI>Panpi&s;tas,</HI> the re&s;t <HI>Serranos,</HI> both
cloathed with Skins, but the la&s;t &s;et up|on
the <HI>Panpi&s;tas</HI> as their mortal Enemies
wherever they meet with them. All
Fight on Hor&s;e-back, either with Lances
pointed with Iron or Bones &s;harpen'd,
or el&s;e with Bows and Arrows, they
wear Bulls-hides fa&s;hion'd like a Doublet
without &s;leeves, to defend their Bodies.
Their Chiefs that command over them
in War and Peace, are call'd <HI>Couracas.</HI>
When they take any one of their Ene|mies,
alive or dead, they meet all toge|ther,
and after they have reproach'd him,
that either he or his Relations were the
death of their Kindred or Friends, they
cut and tear him into pieces, which they
roa&s;t a little and eat, making a drinking
Bowl of his Scull. They feed mo&s;tly
upon fle&s;h either raw or dre&s;s'd, and
particularly Colts fle&s;h, which they like
better than Veal. They catch abundance
of Fi&s;h likewi&s;e in their Rivers. They
have no &s;ettled places of aboad, but
ramble up and down, &s;everal Families
together, and live in Tents.</P>
<P>I could not inform my &s;elf exactly
what Religion they were of, but I was
told that they look'd upon the Sun and
<PB N="28" REF="123">
Moon as Deities, and as I travell'd along,
I &s;aw a Savage upon his knees with his
Face to the Sun, who cry'd out and
made &s;trange ge&s;tures with his Hands
and Arms. I learn'd from the Savage that
accompany'd me, that he was one of
tho&s;e they call'd <HI>Papas,</HI> who in the
Morning kneel towards the Sun, and at
Night towards the Moon, to &s;upplicate
tho&s;e fancy'd Divinities to be propitious
to them, to give them fair Weather, and
Victory over their Foes.</P>
<P>They make no great Ceremony in
their Marriages; but when a Relation
dies, after they have rubb'd his body
with a certain Earth that con&s;umes all but
the Bones, they pre&s;erve them, and carry
as many of them as they can convenient|ly
about with them in a &s;ort of Che&s;ts,
and this they do in token of their af|fection
to their Kindred; indeed they
are not wanting in good Offices to them
during their Lives, nor in their Sickne&s;s
and Death.</P>
<P>Along the River <HI>Salladillo,</HI> I took
notice of a great many Parrats, or Pa|pagays,
as the <HI>Spaniards</HI> call them, and
certain Birds, call'd Guacamayos, which
are of divers Colours, and twice or thrice
as big as a Parrat. The River it &s;elf is
<PB N="29" REF="123">
full of the Fi&s;h, call'd <HI>Dorado,</HI> which is
very good to eat. There is al&s;o a Crea|ture
in it, whether 'tis Meat or Poy&s;on
no body knows, it has Four Feet and a
long Tail like a Lizard.</P>
<P>From <HI>Salladillo</HI> quite to <HI>Cordoua,</HI> you
go along a very fine River, that abounds
with Fi&s;h, which is neither wide nor
deep, for it may be forded over. On
the Bank of it you meet with little Plan|tations
every Three or Four Leagues;
which are like Country Hou&s;es inhabi|ted
by <HI>Spaniards, Portugue&s;e,</HI> and the Na|tives,
who have all the nece&s;&s;ary acco|modations
of Life they can wi&s;h, and
are very Civil and Charitable to Stran|gers;
their principal Wealth is in Hor|&s;es
and Mules, in which they Trade with
the Inhabitants of <HI>Peru.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Cordoua</HI> is a Town Situate in a plea&s;ant
and fruitful Plain upon the &s;ide of a
River, bigger and broader than that I
have ju&s;t &s;poken of: 'Tis compos'd of
about 400 Hou&s;es, Built like tho&s;e of
<HI>Buenos Ayres.</HI> It has neither Ditches,
nor Walls, nor Fort for its defence; He
that Commands it is Governor of all the
Provinces of <HI>Tucuman;</HI> and tho' it be
the place of his ordinary Re&s;idence, yet
he is wont now and then, as he &s;ees oc|ca&s;ion,
<PB N="30" REF="124">
to go and pa&s;s &s;ome time at <HI>St.
Jago de l' E&s;tro,</HI> at <HI>St. Miguel de Tucuman,</HI>
(which is the Capital City of the Province)
at <HI>Salta</HI> and at <HI>Xuxui.</HI> In each of the&s;e
Villages there is a Lieutenant, who has
under him an <HI>Alcalde</HI> and &s;ome Officers
for the Admini&s;tration of Ju&s;tice. The
Bi&s;hop of <HI>Tucuman</HI> likewi&s;e u&s;ually re|&s;ides
at <HI>Cordoua,</HI> where the Cathedral
is the only Pari&s;h Church of the whole
Town; but there are divers Convents of
Monks, namely of <HI>Dominicans, Recol|lects,</HI>
and tho&s;e of the Order <HI>de la Mer|cy:</HI>
and one of Nunns. The <HI>Je&s;uits</HI>
have a College there, and their Chappel
is the fine&s;t and riche&s;t of all.</P>
<P>The Inhabitants are Rich in Gold and
Silver, which they get by the Trade
they have for Mules, with which they
furni&s;h <HI>Peru</HI> and other Parts; which is
&s;o con&s;iderable, that they &s;ell about 28
or 30000 of 'em every Year, which they
breed up in their Farms. They u&s;ually
keep 'em till they are about Two Years
old, then expo&s;e 'em to Sale, and have
about Six <HI>Patagons</HI> a piece for 'em. The
Merchants that come to buy 'em, carry
'em to St. <HI>Jago,</HI> to <HI>Salta</HI> and <HI>Xuxui,</HI>
where they leave 'em for Three Years,
till they are well grown and become
<PB N="31" REF="124">
&s;trong, and afterwards bring 'em to <HI>Pe|ru,</HI>
where they pre&s;ently have Vent for
'em, becau&s;e there as well as in the re&s;t
of the We&s;tern part of <HI>America,</HI> the
greate&s;t part of their Carriage is upon
Mules. The People of <HI>Cordoua</HI> al&s;o
drive a Trade in Cows, which they have
from the Countrey of <HI>Buenos Ayres,</HI> and
carry to <HI>Peru,</HI> where without this way
of Sub&s;i&s;tance 'tis certain they would
have much ado to live. This kind of
Traffick makes this Town the mo&s;t con|&s;iderable
in the Province of <HI>Tucuman,</HI>
as well for its Riches and Commodities,
as for the Number of its Inhabitants,
which are counted to be at lea&s;t 5 or
600 Families, be&s;ides Slaves who are
three times the number. But the gene|rality
of 'em of all degrees have no other
Arms but a Sword and Poignard, and
are very indifferent Souldiers, the Air
of the Country, and the Plenty they
enjoy, rendring them Lazy and Cow|ardly.</P>
<P>From <HI>Cordoua</HI> I took the way of St.
<HI>Jago de l' E&s;tro,</HI> which is 90 Leagues
di&s;tant from it. In my Journey I from
time to time, that is Seven or Eight
Leagues, met with &s;ingle Hou&s;es of <HI>Spa|niards</HI>
and <HI>Portugue&s;e,</HI> who live very &s;o|litarily;
<PB N="32" REF="125">
they are all Situate upon &s;mall
Rivulets, &s;ome of 'em at the Corners of
Forre&s;ts which are frequently to be met
with in that Country, and are almo&s;t
all of <HI>Algarobe</HI>-wood, the Fruit of which
&s;erves to make a Drink that is &s;weet
and &s;harpi&s;h, and heady as Wine; o|thers
of them in open Fields, which
are not &s;o well &s;tock'd with Cattle,
as tho&s;e of <HI>Buenos Ayres,</HI> but however
there are enough of 'em, and indeed
more than needs for the &s;ub&s;i&s;tance of the
Inhabitants, who al&s;o make a Trade of
Mules, and Cotton, and Cocheneil for
dying, which the Country produces.</P>
<P><HI>St. Jago de l' E&s;tro</HI> is a Town of a|bout
300 Hou&s;es, without Ditches or
Walls, Situate in a flat Country, &s;ur|rounded
with Forre&s;ts of <HI>Algarobe;</HI> it
lies on an indifferently large River, Na|vigable
for Boats, and pretty well &s;tor'd
with Fi&s;h. The Air is very hot, and
&s;ultry, which makes the Inhabitants la|zy
and effemminate. Their Faces are all
very Tawny; they are mightily given
to their Diverti&s;ements, and mind Traf|fick
very little. There are 300 Men that
can bear Arms, taking in as well the Sa|vages
as Slaves, and they are all ill
Arm'd, and but very mean Souldiers.
<PB N="33" REF="125">
The greate&s;t part of the Women are
hand&s;ome enough, but have generally a
kind of &s;welling in the Throat, which
they call <HI>Coto</HI> in the Language of the
Country, and &s;eems to be much the &s;ame
with what we call a Wen. The Coun|try
is &s;ufficiently &s;tor'd with Wild-Fowl,
Venizon, Wheat, Rye, Barley; and
Fruits, as Figgs, Peaches, Apples, Pears,
Plumbs, Heart-Cherries, Grapes, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
There are abundance of Tigers, that are
very fierce and ravenous; Lions that
are very gentle; and Guanacos that are
as big as Hor&s;es, with very long Necks,
little Heads, and very &s;hort Tails, in
the Stomachs of the&s;e Creatures the
<HI>Bezoar</HI>-&s;tone is found. There are Four
Churches in this Town, namely the Pa|ri&s;h-Church,
that of the <HI>Je&s;uits,</HI> that of
the <HI>Recollect Friers,</HI> and one more.
Here the Inqui&s;itor of the Province of
<HI>Tucuman</HI> has his re&s;idence; he is a Secu|lar
Prie&s;t, and has Commi&s;&s;aries or De|puties
under him, whom he places in
all the other Towns of the Province.</P>
<P>After I had continued Three Days at
<HI>St. Jago,</HI> I went from thence to <HI>Salta,</HI>
which is 100 Leagues from it, and leav|ing
<HI>St. Miguel</HI> of <HI>Tucuman</HI> on the left
hand, which is a Town under the Juri&s;|diction
<PB N="34" REF="126">
of <HI>St. Jago,</HI> I took the Road of
<HI>E&s;&s;eco,</HI> finding in my way &s;ome little Vil|lages
of <HI>Spaniards</HI> here and there, and
very few Savages. The Country is flat,
and con&s;i&s;ts partly of Fruitful Plains,
and partly of Forre&s;ts full of Algarobe
and Palm-trees; which bear Dates &s;ome|what
le&s;s than tho&s;e in the Ea&s;t-Coun|tries,
as well as many other &s;orts of Trees
and Plants, among&s;t others, tho&s;e that
yield Pitch, and tho&s;e that produce Co|cheneil
and Cotton. There are divers
&s;mall Lakes, about which there are great
quantities of Salt produc'd, which is us'd
by the People of that Country. I &s;tay'd
one day at <HI>E&s;&s;eco,</HI> to prepare my &s;elf
&s;ome Provi&s;ions to live upon. It's Situ|ation
is upon a very hand&s;ome broad
River, which yet may be foarded on
Hor&s;eback. This Town was formerly as
big and as con&s;iderable as <HI>Cordona,</HI> but
is now ruin'd, there being not above 30
Families left in it, for the re&s;t de&s;erted
it, becau&s;e of the great number of Tigers
that infe&s;ted 'em, devouring their Chil|dren,
and &s;ometimes Men when they
could &s;urprize 'em, be&s;ides an incredible
number of Venemous Flies, that &s;ting
very &s;martly, with which the Country
is fill'd for four or five Leagues about
<PB N="35" REF="126">
the Town; &s;o that there's no going a|broad
without being mask'd. This
Country is al&s;o &s;ufficiently Fruitful in
Wheat, Barley, Vines, and other Fruit-trees;
and would abound in Cattle if the
Tigers did not devour 'em.</P>
<P>From <HI>E&s;&s;eco</HI> to <HI>Salta</HI> is 15 Leagues:
And this &s;pace of Land, would be like
that I have ju&s;t now &s;poken of, but that
it is Gravelly in &s;ome places. One may
ea&s;ily di&s;cern <HI>Salta</HI> about 2 Leagues be|fore
one comes at it; becau&s;e it &s;tands
in the middle of a fine Plain, which
is fertile in Corn, Grapes, and other
&s;orts of Fruit, Cattle, and other nece&s;|&s;aries
of Life: Encompa&s;s'd in &s;ome pla|ces
with Hills, and &s;ome pretty high
Mountains. The Town is upon the
bank of a Little River, over which there
is a Bridge: It may contain about 400
Hou&s;es, and 5 or 6 Churches and Con|vents,
the Structure of which, is like that
of tho&s;e I have before de&s;crib'd. 'Tis
not encompa&s;s'd with any Walls, Forti|fications
or Ditches; but the Wars the
Inhabitants have had with their Neigh|bours,
have train'd them in Martial Di&s;|cipline,
and render'd 'em more careful
to have Arms in a readine&s;s than former|ly:
They are about 500 Men, who
<PB N="36" REF="127">
all bear Arms, be&s;ides Slaves, Moulatos,
and Blacks, who are three times as many.
'Tis a place of great re&s;ort, becau&s;e of
the con&s;iderable Trade they have, in
Corn, Meal, Cattle, Wine, Salted Meat,
Tallow, and other Commodities where|with
they Trade with the Inhabitants of
<HI>Peru.</HI></P>
<P>Twelve Leagues beyond it lies <HI>Xuxui,</HI>
which is the la&s;t Town of <HI>Tucuman</HI> on
the &s;ide of <HI>Peru.</HI> There are up and down
on the Road a great many Cottages or
Farms, and more than in any other
place, tho' the Country is not &s;o plea&s;ant
nor &s;o fruitful, being almo&s;t nothing
el&s;e but Hills and Mountains. This
Town of <HI>Xuxui</HI> contains about 300
Hou&s;es: 'Tis not very full of People,
becau&s;e of the continual Wars the Inha|bitants
of it, as well as tho&s;e of <HI>Salta,</HI>
have with the Savages of the Valley of
<HI>Calchaqui,</HI> who are continually hara&s;ing
of 'em. The Cau&s;e that &s;et the&s;e Wars
on Foot is as follows; The Governor
of <HI>Tucuman, Don Alon&s;o de Mercado,</HI>
and <HI>de Villa Corta,</HI> having receiv'd Infor|mation,
that the Hou&s;e of the la&s;t <HI>Incas</HI>
or Kings of <HI>Peru,</HI> which was call'd the
White-hou&s;e, was in this Valley, and
that there was a great deal of Trea&s;ure
<PB N="37" REF="127">
there, which the Natives kept as a mark
of their Ancient Grandeur, gave advice
of it to his Catholick Maje&s;ty, and
begg'd leave to make a Conque&s;t of it,
and &s;ubject it to his Government, as it
had far'd with &s;o many other places
which he obtain'd. To accompli&s;h his
de&s;ign, he thought meet to employ <HI>Don
Pedro Bohoriers</HI> a Moor, and Native of
<HI>E&s;tramadura,</HI> as being a Per&s;on who had
been accu&s;tom'd to conver&s;e with Savage
People, and was capable of carrying on
Intreagues among&s;t 'em, and &s;o more fit
than another, to make this de&s;ign &s;uc|ceed;
but the bu&s;ine&s;s had a quite con|trary
Event. For this <HI>Bohoriers,</HI> when
he was got among the Savages of this
Valley, and had gain'd their Affections,
in&s;tead of acquitting him&s;elf of his
Commi&s;&s;ion, endeavor'd to e&s;tabli&s;h him|&s;elf
in Power among&s;t 'em, in which he
&s;ucceeded &s;o well, that by his Craft and
good addre&s;s, he brought 'em to choo&s;e
and acknowledge him for their King;
after which he declar'd him&s;elf again&s;t
this <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Governor, and began a War
with him towards the end of 1638, and
&s;everal times routed him and his Forces,
which gave occa&s;ion to &s;everal of the
<HI>Indian</HI> Natives, that were under the Do|minion
<PB N="38" REF="128">
of the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> to throw of their
Yoke, and joyn with the People of
this Valley, who by the&s;e additions have
render'd them&s;elves &s;omewhat formida|ble.
Hither al&s;o the Slaves of <HI>Peru,</HI>
particularly tho&s;e that &s;erve in the Mines,
fly, when they can find an opportunity
to make their e&s;cape: And the &s;afe re|treat
they find here, draws a great num|ber
of 'em to this place; in&s;omuch that
the <HI>Spaniards</HI> would not have half Men
enough to work in the Mines, if they
did not get Negros from <HI>Congo, Angola,</HI>
and other places on the Coa&s;t of <HI>Guinea,</HI>
by means of divers <HI>Genoe&s;e</HI> that go thi|ther
to fetch 'em, and &s;ell 'em to them
at a price concerted between 'em.</P>
<P>From <HI>Xuxui</HI> to <HI>Poto&s;i</HI> they count
a 100 Leagues, the way is very trou|ble&s;ome,
and there is but this one Road
to go from <HI>Tucuman</HI> to <HI>Peru.</HI> Two
Leagues from <HI>Xuxui</HI> I began to advance
to the Mountains, between which there's
a little and very narrow Valley, that
reaches as far as <HI>Omagoaca,</HI> which is 20
Leagues beyond, and along it there runs
a &s;mall River, which one is oblig'd to
pa&s;s and repa&s;s very often. Before you
are got 4 Leagues in this Road, you
meet with Vulcanos, or Burning Moun|tains,
<PB N="39" REF="128">
full of Sulphurous matter, which
break out in Flames from time to time,
and &s;ometimes bur&s;t open and throw
quantities of Earth into the Valley, which
makes the way &s;o dirty when a Rain
comes &s;oon after it, as it almo&s;t always
happens, that &s;ometimes you mu&s;t be
forc'd to &s;tay Five or Six Months, or till
the Summer comes to dry it to make it
pa&s;&s;able. The&s;e Vulcanos continue for
2 Leagues upon this Road, and in all
this &s;pace, there are no Hou&s;es either of
<HI>Spaniards</HI> or Savages, but beyond it all
along as far as <HI>Omagoaca,</HI> there are a
great many little Cottages, inhabited on|ly
by <HI>Indians,</HI> and depending on &s;ome
Towns of theirs, which are govern'd by
their Chiefs, whom they call <HI>Couracas,</HI>
who have a Cacique over them, who&s;e
Orders they obey, and who&s;e re&s;idence
is at <HI>Omagoaca,</HI> which is a Town of 200
Hou&s;es, built of Earth, and &s;tanding in
no good Order. The Land about it is none
of the be&s;t, however they &s;ow Wheat
there, and a great quantity of Millet,
which the <HI>Indians</HI> ordinarily u&s;e. As
for Cattle, they have very few, and
commonly eat Beef dry'd in the Sun,
which is brought them by tho&s;e that
Trade with 'em; they have al&s;o Goats
<PB N="40" REF="129">
and Sheep of their own Product.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t of the&s;e Savages are Catho|licks,
and live according to the Rules
of the Roman Catholick Religion; they
have a Church at <HI>Omagoaca,</HI> which is
&s;upplied with Prie&s;ts, who go from time
to time to celebrate Ma&s;s there: The&s;e
Prie&s;ts dwell at <HI>Socchoa,</HI> which is the
Plantation of <HI>Don Paulo d' Obaudo,</HI> who
is a <HI>Spaniard,</HI> but born in this Country,
and is Lord Proprietor of it, which
contains not only all the Valley of <HI>Oma|goaca,</HI>
but likewi&s;e a great &s;pace of Land
beyond, and is a Country of about 60
or 80 Leagues in extent, where there are
a great many <HI>Vigognes</HI> of who&s;e Wool this
Lord makes a very con&s;iderable Advan|tage.
He takes the&s;e Creatures with a great
deal of ea&s;e by means of his Subjects the
<HI>Indians,</HI> who have no other trouble than
that of making a great Inclo&s;ure with
Nets about a Foot and a half high, to
which they tie a great many Feathers
that are blown to and fro by the Wind,
after which the Savages hunt the&s;e Crea|tures,
and drive 'em within the Nets, as
they do Wild-Boars in <HI>France</HI> into the
Toils; when this is done, &s;ome come
on Hor&s;e-back within the compa&s;s of
Ground in which they are inclos'd, and
<PB N="41" REF="129">
while the poor Bea&s;ts dare not go near
the Nets for fear of the Feathers that
play about 'em, they with certain Bowls
fa&s;tened to Cords, knock down and
kill as many of 'em as they plea&s;e.</P>
<P>From <HI>Omagoaca</HI> to <HI>Mayo,</HI> they count
it 30 Leagues, &amp; there's nothing to be
met with along this way, but a very
few Plantations of Savages, becau&s;e 'tis
&s;o very Cold here in the Winter, that
'tis hard to be endur'd.</P>
<P>The way from <HI>Mayo</HI> to <HI>Toropalca</HI> is
through very plea&s;ant Plains, there are
Two hundred Hou&s;es in the Town, in|habited
by Catholick Savages, only one
<HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> lives there with his Fami|ly.</P>
<P>Beyond <HI>Toropalca,</HI> is the Country of
<HI>Chichas</HI> which is very Mountainous, and
is &s;tor'd with divers Mines of Gold and
Silver, and Work-hou&s;es where they
prepare the Metal. 'Tis 25 Leagues in
extent as far as <HI>Poto&s;i,</HI> where I arriv'd
after a Journey of Sixty three Days.</P>

<HEAD>A De&s;cription of the City of Poto&s;i,

<P>I Was no &s;ooner alighted from my
Hor&s;e, at a Merchants Hou&s;e to
whom I had been recommended, but I
was conducted by him to the Pre&s;ident
of the Provinces of <HI>Los Charcas,</HI> to
whom the Order I carried from the King
of <HI>Spain</HI> was directed, as the Principal
Director of his Catholick Maje&s;ty's Af|fairs
in this Province, in which <HI>Poto&s;i</HI> is
Situate, which is the place of his Ordi|nary
Re&s;idence, altho' the City <HI>de la
Plata</HI> is the Capital. After I had deli|ver'd
the Order to him, I was brought
to the Corregidor, to deliver that which
belong'd to him, and afterwards to tho&s;e
other Officers for whom I brought Or|ders;
they all receiv'd me very well,
particularly the Pre&s;ident, who pre&s;ent|ed
me with a Chain of Gold for the
good News I had brought him.</P>
<P>But before we go any farther 'tis con|venient
I &s;hould give &s;ome de&s;cription
of the City of <HI>Poto&s;i,</HI> as I have done of
<PB N="43" REF="130">
others. The <HI>Spaniards</HI> call it the Impe|rial
City, but no body could ever tell
me for what rea&s;on; 'tis Situate at the
Foot of a Mountain, call'd <HI>Araza&s;&s;ou,</HI>
and divided in the mid&s;t by a River,
which comes from a Lake inclos'd with
Walls, which lies about a quarter of a
League above the City, and is a kind of
re&s;erver to hold the Water that is nece&s;|&s;ary
for the Work-hou&s;es of that part
of the City, which is on this &s;ide of the
River, over again&s;t the Mountain, is
rais'd upon a little Hill, and is the larg|e&s;t
and mo&s;t inhabited part; for on
that which is on the &s;ide of the Moun|tain,
there's &s;carce any thing but Engines
and the Hou&s;es of tho&s;e that Work in
'em. The City has neither Walls, Ditch|es,
nor Forts for its defence, there are
reckon'd to be 4000 Hou&s;es well built
of good Stone, with &s;everal Floors, af|ter
the manner of the Buildings in <HI>Spain.</HI>
The Churches are well made, and all
richly adorn'd with Plate, Tape&s;try,
and other Ornaments, and above all
tho&s;e of the Monks and Nunns, of
whom there are &s;everal Convents of
different Orders, which are very well
furni&s;h'd. This is not the lea&s;t populous
City of <HI>Peru,</HI> with <HI>Spaniards, Me&s;tices,
<PB N="44" REF="131">
Strangers,</HI> and <HI>Natives</HI> (which la&s;t the
<HI>Spaniards</HI> call <HI>Indios</HI>) with <HI>Moulatos</HI> and
<HI>Negroes.</HI> They count there are between
3 and 4000 Natural <HI>Spaniards</HI> bear|ing
Arms, who have the Reputation of
being very &s;tout Men and good Souldi|ers.
The number of the <HI>Me&s;tices</HI> is not
much le&s;s, nor are they le&s;s expert at a
Weapon, but the greate&s;t part of 'em,
are Idle, apt to quarrel and Treache|rous,
therefore they commonly wear
Three or Four Buff-wa&s;t-coats one upon
another, which are proof again&s;t the
point of a Sword, to &s;ecure them&s;elves
from private &s;tabs. The Strangers there
are but few, there are &s;ome <HI>Dutch, Iri&s;h,</HI>
and <HI>Genoe&s;e;</HI> and &s;ome <HI>French,</HI> mo&s;t of
whom are of <HI>St. Malo, Provence</HI> or <HI>Bay|onne,</HI>
and pa&s;s for People of <HI>Navarre</HI>
and <HI>Bi&s;caye.</HI> As for the <HI>Indians</HI> they are
reckon'd to amount to near 10000 be|&s;ides
the <HI>Moulatos</HI> and the <HI>Blacks:</HI> but
they are not permitted to wear either
Swords or Fire-Arms, no not their Cou|racas
and Caciques, tho' they may all
a&s;pire to any degree of Knight-hood,
and to Benefices, to which they are of|ten
rais'd, for their laudable Actions,
and good Services. They are al&s;o for|bidden
to wear the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> habit, but
<PB N="45" REF="131">
are oblig'd to cloath them&s;elves in a dif|ferent
manner, in a clo&s;e-coat without
&s;leeves, which they wear next their Shirts,
to which their Band and lac'd Cuffs are
fa&s;ten'd, their Breeches are wide at bot|tom
after the <HI>French</HI> fa&s;hion; their Legs
and Feet naked. The <HI>Blacks</HI> and <HI>Mou|latos</HI>
being in the Service of the <HI>Spa|niards,</HI>
are habited after the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI>
Mode, and may bear Arms, and all the
<HI>Indian</HI> Slaves after Ten Years &s;ervice are
&s;et at liberty, and have the &s;ame privi|leges
with the others. The Government
of this City is very exact, by the Care
which is taken by Twenty four Magi|&s;trates,
who are con&s;tantly ob&s;erving,
that good orders be kept in it; be&s;ides
the Corregidor and Pre&s;ident of <HI>Los Char|cas,</HI>
who directs Officers after the man|ner
of <HI>Spain.</HI> It is to be ob&s;erv'd, that
excepting the&s;e two Principal Officers,
as well at <HI>Poto&s;i</HI> as every where el&s;e in
the <HI>Indies,</HI> all the People, whether
Knights, Gentlemen, Officers or others,
are concern'd in Commerce: of which
&s;ome of them make &s;o great an advan|tage,
that in the City of <HI>Poto&s;i,</HI> there
are &s;ome reckon'd to be worth, Two,
&s;ome Three, and &s;ome Four Millions of
Crowns; and a great many worth Two,
<PB N="46" REF="132">
Three, or Four hundred thou&s;and
Crowns. The common People to live
much at their ea&s;e, but are all proud and
haughty, and always go very fine, either
in Cloth of Gold and Silver, or in Scar|let,
or Silk trimmed with a great deal
of Gold and Silver-Lace. The Furni|ture
of their Hou&s;es is very Rich, for
they are generally &s;erv'd in Plate. The
Wives both of Gentlemen and Citi|zens,
are kept very clo&s;e, to a degree
beyond what they are in <HI>Spain;</HI> they ne|ver
go abroad, unle&s;s it be to go to
Ma&s;s, or to make &s;ome Vi&s;it, or to &s;ome
publick Fea&s;t; and that but rarely. The
Women here are generally addicted to
exce&s;s in taking Coca: This is a Plant
that comes from the &s;ide of <HI>Cu&s;co,</HI> which
when it is made up in Rowls and dry'd
they chew, as &s;ome do Tobacco; they
are &s;o heated, and &s;ometimes ab&s;olutely
fuddled by it, that they have no com|mand
of them&s;elves at all: 'Tis likewi&s;e
often us'd by the Men, and has the &s;ame
effects upon them. They are otherwi&s;e
very Temperate in eating and drinking,
tho' they have before dwelt in places
well &s;tor'd with all &s;ort of Provi&s;ions,
as Beef, Mutton, Fowls, Venizon, raw
and pre&s;erv'd Fruits, Corn and Wine,
<PB N="47" REF="132">
which are brought hither from other
parts, and &s;ome from a great di&s;tance,
which makes the&s;e Commodities dear, &s;o
that the meaner &s;ort of People; e&s;pecially
tho&s;e that have very little before-hand,
would find it hard enough to live there,
if Money were not very plenty, and
ea&s;ie to be got by them that are willing
to work.</P>
<P>The be&s;t and fine&s;t Silver in all the <HI>In|dies,</HI>
is that of the Mines of <HI>Poto&s;i,</HI> the prin|cipal
of which are found in the Mountain
of <HI>Aranza&s;&s;e,</HI> where be&s;ides the prodigious
quantities of Silver that have been taken
out of Veins, in which the Mettal evi|dently
appear'd, and which are now
exhau&s;ted, there is almo&s;t as great quan|tities
of it found in places where they
had not digg'd before; nay from &s;ome
of the Earth which they threw a&s;ide for|merly
when they open'd the Mines, and
made Pits, and Cro&s;s-ways in the Moun|tains,
they have taken Silver, and have
found by this, that the Silver has been
form'd &s;ince that time, which &s;hews how
proper the Quality of this Ground is
for the production of that Metal: But
indeed this Earth does not yield &s;o much
as the Mines that are found by Veins a|mong
the Rocks. There are be&s;ides
<PB N="48" REF="133">
the&s;e another &s;ort of Veins of Earth
which they call <HI>Paillaco,</HI> which are as
hard as a Stone, and of the Colour of
Clay, which were &s;lighted heretofore,
and yet as Experience has &s;ince taught,
were not &s;o contemptable as was &s;up|pos'd;
&s;ince Silver is got out of 'em
with &s;o little Charge, that there is no
incon&s;iderable profit found in the Work.
Be&s;ides the Mines of this Mountain, there
are a great many others about the Coun|try
at a greater di&s;tance, that are pretty
good, among&s;t others tho&s;e of <HI>Lippes,</HI>
of <HI>Carangas,</HI> and of <HI>Porco;</HI> but tho&s;e
of <HI>Ouroures</HI> that have been lately di&s;co|ver'd
are better.</P>
<P>The King of <HI>Spain</HI> does not cau&s;e any
of the&s;e Mines to be wrought on his
own account, but leaves 'em to tho&s;e
Per&s;ons that make the Di&s;covery of 'em,
who remain Ma&s;ters of 'em after the Cor|regidor
has vi&s;ited 'em, and declar'd
'em Proprietors, on the accu&s;tom'd Con|ditions
and Privileges. The &s;ame Cor|regidor
de&s;cribes and marks out the &s;u|perfices
of the Ground, in which they
are allow'd to open the Mine on the out|&s;ide,
which does not for all that, limit
or re&s;train their work under-ground;
every Man having liberty to follow the
<PB N="49" REF="133">
Vein he has found, let the extent and
depth of it reach never &s;o far, tho' it
&s;hould cro&s;s that which another has dig|ged
near it. All that the King re&s;erves
for him&s;elf, be&s;ides the Duties we &s;hall
hereafter &s;peak of, is to give a general
direction by his Officers, for all the
work of the Mines, and to order the
number of Savages to be employ'd in 'em;
to prevent the di&s;orders that would ari&s;e,
if every Proprietor of the Mines &s;hould
have liberty to &s;et as many of 'em to
work as he pleas'd; which would fre|quently
give occa&s;ion to tho&s;e that are
mo&s;t powerful and Rich, to ingro&s;s and
have &s;o great a Number of 'em, that few
or none would remain for others to em|ploy,
to keep their work going forward:
for this would be contrary to the Kings
Intere&s;t, which is to make Provi&s;ion that
that there be a &s;ufficient number of Slaves
for all the Mines that are open'd. For
this end he obliges all the <HI>Couracas</HI> or
Chiefs of the Savages, to furni&s;h every
one a certain number, which they mu&s;t
always keep compleat, or el&s;e are forc'd
to give twice as much Money as would
have been paid in Wages to tho&s;e that
are wanting, if they had been pre&s;ent.
Tho&s;e that are de&s;tin'd for the Mines of
<PB N="50" REF="134">
<HI>Poto&s;i,</HI> don't amount to above Two
thou&s;and and two or three hundred,
the&s;e are brought and put into a great
Enclo&s;ure which is at the Foot of the
Mountain, where the Corregidor makes
a di&s;tribution of 'em to the Conductors
of the Mines, according to the Number
they want, and after Six days con&s;tant
Work, the Conductor brings 'em back
the Saturday following to the &s;ame place,
where the Corregidor cau&s;es a review to
be made of 'em, to make the owners of
the Mines give 'em the Wages that are
appointed 'em, and to &s;ee how many
of 'em are dead, that the <HI>Couracas</HI> may
be oblig'd to &s;upply the number that is
Wanting: for there's no Week pa&s;&s;es but
&s;ome of 'em die, either by divers acci|dents
that Occur, as the tumbling down of
great quantities of Earth, and falling of
Stones, or by Sickne&s;s and other Ca&s;ual|ties.
They are &s;ometimes very much in|commoded
by Winds that are &s;hut up in
the Mines; the coldne&s;s of which joyn'd
to that of &s;ome parts of the Earth, chills
'em &s;o exce&s;&s;ively, that unle&s;s they
chew'd <HI>Coca,</HI> which heats and fuddles
'em, it would be intolerable to 'em. An|other
great hard&s;hip which they &s;uffer is,
that in other places, the Sulphurous and
<PB N="51" REF="134">
Mineral Vapours are are &s;o great, that it
&s;trangely drys 'em up, &s;o that it hinders
'em from free re&s;piration; and for this
they have no other remedy, than the
Drink which is made with the Herb of
<HI>Paraguay,</HI> of which they prepare a great
quantity to refre&s;h and moi&s;ten 'em,
when they come out of the Mines at the
times appointed for eating or &s;leeping;
this Drink &s;erves 'em al&s;o for Phy&s;ick
to make 'em Vomit, and ca&s;t up what|ever
incommodes their Stomachs. A|mong
the&s;e Savages they ordinarily
choo&s;e the be&s;t Workmen to break up
the Oar between the Rocks; this they
do with Iron-barrs, which the <HI>Spaniards</HI>
call <HI>Palancas,</HI> and other In&s;truments of
Iron; others &s;erve to carry what they
digg in little Baskets to the entrance of
the Mine; others to put it in Sacks, and
load it upon a &s;ort of great Sheep, which
they call <HI>Carneros de la Tierra,</HI> they are
taller than A&s;&s;es, and commonly carry
Two hundred Pound weight; the&s;e &s;erve
to carry it to the Work-hou&s;es which are
in the Town along the River, which
comes from the Lake I have &s;poken of
before. In the&s;e Work-hou&s;es which are a
Hundred and twenty in Number; the
Oar is refined, of which take the follow|ing
<PB N="52" REF="135">
account. They fir&s;t beat it well up|on
Anvils with certain great Hammers,
which a Mill continually keeps at work,
when they are pretty well reduc'd to
Powder, they pa&s;s it thro' a fine Sieve,
and &s;pread it upon the Ground about
half a Foot thick in a &s;quare place that
is very &s;mooth, prepar'd for the pur|po&s;e;
then they ca&s;t a great deal of
Water upon it, after which they with
a Sieve &s;pread upon it a certain quanti|ty
of Quick-&s;ilver, which is propor|tion'd
by the Officers of the Mint, and
al&s;o a Liquid &s;ub&s;tance of Iron, which
is prepar'd by Two Mill&s;tones, one of
which is fix'd, and the other is continu|ly
turning, between the&s;e they put an
Old Anvil, or &s;ome other Ma&s;&s;y piece
of Iron, which is worn away and Con|&s;um'd
with Water by the turning Mill|&s;tone,
&s;o that 'tis reduc'd to a certain
Liquid Matter. The Oar being thus pre|par'd,
they &s;tir it about and mix it, as
Men do when they make Mortar, for a
Fortnight together, every day temper|ing
it with Water; and after this they
&s;everal times put it into a Tub, where|in
there is a little Mill, which by its mo|tion
&s;eparates from it all the Earth with
the Water, and ca&s;ts 'em off together,
<PB N="53" REF="135">
&s;o that nothing but the Metallick Mat|ter
remains at the bottom, which is af|terwards
put into the Fire in Crucibles,
to &s;eparate the Quick-&s;ilver from it,
which is done by Evaporation, for as
for the Iron &s;ub&s;tance, that does not
Evaporate, but remains mix'd with the
Silver, which is the rea&s;on that there is al|ways
in Eight Ounces (for example &s;ake)
Three quarters of an Ounce or therea|bouts
of fal&s;e Alloy.</P>
<P>The Silver when thus refin'd is car|ried
to the Mint, where they make an
E&s;&s;ay of it whether it be of the right Al|loy,
after which it is melted into Barrs
or Ingots, which are weigh'd, and the
fifth part of 'em deducted, which be|longs
to the King, and are &s;tamp'd with
his mark; the re&s;t appertain to the Mer|chant,
who in like manner applies his
mark to them; and takes 'em away from
thence when he plea&s;es in Barrs, or el&s;e
converts 'em into Reals and other Money.
This fifth part is the only profit the King
has from the Mines, which yet are
e&s;teem'd to amount to &s;everal Millions;
But be&s;ides this, he draws con&s;iderable
Sums by the ordinary Impo&s;itions upon
Goods, without reckoning what he rai|&s;es
upon Quick-&s;ilver, both that which
<PB N="54" REF="136">
is taken out of the Mines of <HI>Guancave|lica,</HI>
which are Situated between <HI>Lima</HI>
and <HI>Cu&s;co;</HI> and that which is brought
from <HI>Spain,</HI> with which Two Ve&s;&s;els
are loaded every Year, becau&s;e that
which is taken out of the&s;e Mines is not
&s;ufficient for all the <HI>Indies.</HI></P>
<P>They u&s;e divers ways of Carriage, to
Tran&s;port all the Silver that is annually
made about <HI>Poto&s;i</HI> for <HI>Spain;</HI> fir&s;t they
Load it upon Mules, that carry it to <HI>Ari|ca,</HI>
which is a Port on the South-Sea,
from whence they Tran&s;port it in &s;mall
Ve&s;&s;els to the Fort of <HI>Lima,</HI> or <HI>Los
Reys,</HI> which is a Fort upon the &s;ame
Sea, Two Leagues from <HI>Lima;</HI> here
they Embark it with all that comes from
other parts of <HI>Peru,</HI> in Two great Gal|lions
that belong to his Catholick Ma|je&s;ty,
each of which carry 1000 Tuns,
and are Arm'd each with 50 or 60 Pie|ces
of Canon; the&s;e are commonly ac|companied
with a great many &s;mall
Merchant Ships as Richly Loaded, which
have no Guns but a few Petareroes to
give Salutes; and take their Cour&s;e to|wards
<HI>Panama,</HI> taking care always to &s;end
a little Pinnace 8 or 10 Leagues before
to make di&s;coveries. They might make
this way in a Fortnights time, having al|ways
<PB N="55" REF="136">
the help of the South-wind which
reigns alone in this Sea; yet they never
make it le&s;s than a Months Voyage, be|cau&s;e
by this delay the Commander of
the Gallions makes a great advantage in
furni&s;hing tho&s;e with Cards that have a
mind to play on Ship-board, during the
Voyage, which amounts to a very con|&s;iderable
Sum, both becau&s;e the Tribute
he receives is Ten Patagons for every
Pack of Cards, and becau&s;e there is a
prodigious quantity of 'em con&s;um'd,
they being continually at play; and
there being &s;carce any body aboard, but
is concern'd for very con&s;iderable Sums.
When the Gallions arrive at <HI>Panama</HI> on
the Continent, they put their Lading a|&s;hoar,
and wait to hear of tho&s;e from
<HI>Spain,</HI> who commonly about the &s;ame
time, or a little after, arrive at <HI>Porto|belo,</HI>
which is 18 Leagues from the
North-Sea; in the mean time they carry
thither part of the Gold, Silver, and other
Commodities of this Fleet which are de|&s;ign'd
for <HI>Europe,</HI> upon Mules by Land,
and part by Water upon the River of
<HI>Chiagre,</HI> in Boats made of an entire piece
of Wood call'd <HI>Piragouas.</HI> A few days
after they are unladen, and after the Gal|lions
are likewi&s;e arriv'd from <HI>Spain;</HI> a
<PB N="56" REF="137">
very great Fair is held there, for a Fort|night
together, in which they Sell and
Barter all &s;orts of Goods nece&s;&s;ary for
each Country; which is perform'd with &s;o
much hone&s;ty, that the Sale is made only
by the Inventories, without opening the
Bales, without the lea&s;t Fraud. The Fair
being ended, they all retire to the pla|ces
to which they re&s;pectively belong.
The Gallions that are to return into
<HI>Spain,</HI> go to <HI>Havana,</HI> in the I&s;land of
<HI>Cuba,</HI> where they wait for the Arrival of
the Flota of <HI>la Vera-Crux</HI> in <HI>New Spain;</HI>
as &s;oon as that has joyn'd 'em, they con|tinue
their Cour&s;e together, pa&s;&s;ing thro'
the Channel of <HI>Bahama</HI> along the Coa&s;t
of <HI>Florida,</HI> they touch at the I&s;land of
<HI>Bermudos,</HI> where they commonly meet
with Advice of the State of Affairs in
<HI>Europe,</HI> and with orders to direct them
how to avoid any di&s;a&s;ters, and to per|form
their Voyage in &s;afety. As for
the Gallions of <HI>Peru,</HI> after they have
taken in a new Cargo at <HI>Panama,</HI> they
return to <HI>Lima,</HI> &s;teering divers Cour&s;es,
becau&s;e of the Contrariety of the Wind,
which keeps 'em Two or Three Months
at Sea. Being there, they di&s;po&s;e of
what they have for <HI>Peru:</HI> And the re&s;t
of the Goods is taken off by the Mer|chants
<PB N="57" REF="137">
of <HI>Chili,</HI> who give a great many
Commodities of their Country in ex|change
for 'em; as Goats-leather, which
in the Language of the Country is call'd
<HI>Cordouan,</HI> Cordage, Hemp, Pitch and
Tar, Oyls, Olives, and Almonds, and
above all a great quantity of Du&s;t of
Gold, which is taken out of the Rivers
of <HI>Capiapo, Coquinbo, Baldivia,</HI> and others
which fall into the South-Sea. And now
we are &s;peaking of the Commodities of
<HI>Chili,</HI> &s;ome &s;mall matter mu&s;t be &s;aid
concerning this great Province or King|dom.
At the Mouths of tho&s;e Rivers,
of which I have ju&s;t been &s;peaking, there
are good Ports, and Cities, each of which
con&s;i&s;t of about 4 or 500 Hou&s;es, and
tho&s;e &s;ufficiently &s;tock'd with People.
The mo&s;t con&s;iderable Cities upon the
Sea-Coa&s;t, are <HI>Baldivia, la Conception,
Copiapo</HI> and <HI>Coquinbo. Baldivia</HI> is Forti|fied,
and has a Garri&s;on in it, u&s;ually
compos'd only of Bani&s;h'd Men, and
Malefactors of the <HI>Indies;</HI> the Three o|thers
are Cities of Trade. Farther up
in the Countrey is <HI>St. Jago de Chili,</HI>
which is the Capital of all <HI>Chili,</HI> where
there is likewi&s;e a &s;trong Garri&s;on, and
&s;ome regular Troops, by rea&s;on of the
continual War they have with the Sa|vages,
<PB N="58" REF="138">
call'd <HI>Aoucans.</HI> Beyond it in the
Mountains, lies the little Province of
<HI>Chicuito,</HI> of which the principal Places
are <HI>St. Juan de la Frontera,</HI> and <HI>Mendoca,</HI>
round about the&s;e Towns, there grows
a great deal of Corn, and abundance of
Vines, which furni&s;h the Country of
<HI>Chili,</HI> and the Province of <HI>Tucuman</HI> as far
as <HI>Buenos Ayres.</HI></P>
<P>Three Weeks after my Arrival at <HI>Po|to&s;i;</HI>
there were great rejoycings made
for the Birth of the Prince of <HI>Spain,</HI>
which la&s;ted for a Fortnight together,
during which time all Work cea&s;ed,
throughout the City, in the Mines, and in
the Adjacent places, and all the People
great and &s;mall, whether <HI>Spaniards, For|reigners,
Indians,</HI> or <HI>Blacks,</HI> minded
nothing el&s;e but to do &s;omething extra|ordinary
for the Solemnizing of this
Fe&s;tival. It began with a Cavalcade,
made by the Corregidor, the Twenty
four Magi&s;trates of the City, the other
Officers, the Principal of the Nobility
and Gentry, and the mo&s;t eminent Mer|chants
of the City; all richly Cloth'd.
All the re&s;t of the People, and particu|larly
the Ladies being at the Windows,
and ca&s;ting down abundance of per|fum'd
Waters, and great quantities of
<PB N="59" REF="138">
dry Sweet-meats. The following days
they had &s;everal Plays, &s;ome of which
they call <HI>Juegos de Toros,</HI> others <HI>Juegos
de Cannas,</HI> &s;everal &s;orts of Ma&s;querades,
Comedies, Balls, with Vocal and In&s;tru|mental
Mu&s;ick, and other Diverti&s;ements,
which were carry'd on one day by the
Gentlemen, another day by the Citizens;
one while by the Gold-&s;miths, another
while by the Miners; &s;ome by the Peo|ple
of divers Nations, others by the <HI>In|dians,</HI>
and all with great Magnificence,
and a prodigious Expence. The Re|joycings
of the <HI>Indians</HI> de&s;erve a par|ticular
remark, for be&s;ides that they
were richly cloth'd, and after a different
manner, and that Comical enough; with
their Bows and Arrows; they in one
Night and Morning, in the Chief Pub|lick
place of the City, prepar'd a Gar|den
in the form of a Labyrinth, the Plats
of which were adorn'd with Fountains
&s;pouting out Waters, furni&s;hed with all
&s;orts of Trees and Flowers, full of
Birds, and all &s;orts of Wild-bea&s;ts, as
Lions, Tygers and other kinds; in the
mid&s;t of which they expre&s;s'd their Joy
a Thou&s;and different ways, with extra|ordinary
Ceremonies. The la&s;t day
&s;ave one &s;urpa&s;s'd all the re&s;t, and that
<PB N="60" REF="139">
was a Race at the Ring, which was per|form'd
at the Charge of the City with
very &s;urpizing Machines. Fir&s;t there
appear'd a Ship Tow'd along by Sava|ges,
of the bulk and burden of a 100
Tuns, with her Guns and Equipage of
Men cloth'd in Curious Habit, her An|chors,
Ropes, and Sails &s;welling with
the Wind, which very luckily blew a|long
the Street through which they
drew her to the great publick place,
where as &s;oon as &s;he arriv'd, &s;he &s;aluted
the Company, by the di&s;charge of all
her Canon; and at the &s;ame time a <HI>Spa|ni&s;h</HI>
Lord, repre&s;enting an Emperor of
the <HI>Ea&s;t,</HI> coming to Congratulate the
Birth of the Prince, came out of the
Ve&s;&s;el attended with Six Gentlemen, and
a very fine Train of Servants that led
their Hor&s;es, which they mounted, and
&s;o went to &s;alute the Pre&s;ident of <HI>Los
Charcas,</HI> and while they were making
their Compliment to him, their Hor&s;es
kneel'd down, and kept in that Po&s;ture,
having been taught this Trick before.
They afterwards went to &s;alute the Cor|regidor,
and the Judges of the Field,
from whom when they had receiv'd per|mi&s;&s;ion
to run at the Ring again&s;t the
Defendants, they acquitted them&s;elves
<PB N="61" REF="139">
with great Gallantry, and receiv'd very
fine prizes di&s;tributed by the hands of
the Ladies. The Race at the Ring be|ing
fini&s;h'd, the Ship and a great many
other &s;mall Barks that were brought
thither advanc'd to attack a great
Ca&s;tle wherein <HI>Cromwel</HI> the Protector,
who was then in War with the King of
<HI>Spain,</HI> was feign'd to be &s;hut up; and
after a pretty long Combat of Fire-works;
the fire took hold of the Ship,
the &s;mall Barkes, and the Ca&s;tle and
all was con&s;um'd together. After this
a great many pieces of Gold and Silver
were di&s;tributed and thrown among the
People in the Name of his Catholick
Maje&s;ty: And there were &s;ome particu|lar
Per&s;ons that had the prodigality to
throw away Two or Three Thou&s;and
Crowns a Man among the Mob. The
Day following the&s;e Rejoycings were
concluded by a Proce&s;&s;ion, made from
the great Church to that of the Recol|lects,
in which the Holy Sacrament was
carry'd, attended with all the Clergy
and Laiety; and becau&s;e the way from
one of the&s;e Churches to the other had
been unpav'd for the Celebration of the
other Rejoycings, they repair'd it for
this Proce&s;&s;ion with Barrs of Silver,
<PB N="62" REF="140">
with which all the way was entirely
cover'd. The Altar where the Ho&s;t was
to be Lodg'd in the Church of the Re|collects
was &s;o furni&s;h'd with Figures,
Ve&s;&s;els, and Plates of Gold and Silver,
adorn'd with Pearles, Diamonds, and
other Precious Stones, that &s;carce ever
could any thing be &s;een more Rich:
For the Citizens brought thither all the
rare&s;t Jewels they had. The extraordi|nary
Charge of this whole time of Re|joycing,
was reckon'd to amount to a|bove
500000 Crowns.</P>
<P>The&s;e Diverti&s;ements being ended, the
re&s;t of the time that I continued at <HI>Poto&s;i,</HI>
was employ'd in compleating the Sale
of the Goods, the Inventories of which I
had brought with me, and I oblig'd my
&s;elf to cau&s;e the&s;e Goods to be deliver'd
in a certain time at <HI>Xuxui,</HI> and to pay
all the Charge of Carriage &s;o far. I
took mo&s;t of my Payment in Silver,
namely in Patagons, Plate, Barrs, and
Pignas, which is Virgin-&s;ilver; and the
re&s;t in <HI>Vigogne</HI> Wool, and when I had
quite fini&s;h'd the bu&s;ine&s;s for which I
was &s;ent to <HI>Poto&s;i;</HI> I left the place to
return to <HI>Buenos Ayres</HI> the &s;ame way I
came. I loaded all my Bales upon Mules,
which is the ordinary way of Carriage
<PB N="63" REF="140">
to pa&s;s the Moutains which divide <HI>Peru</HI>
from <HI>Tucuman.</HI> But when I was arriv'd
at <HI>Xuxui,</HI> I thought meet to make u&s;e of
Waggons, which is much more Com|modious,
and thus I continu'd my Tra|vels;
and after a Journey of 4 Months
happily arriv'd at the River of <HI>Lucan;</HI>
which is 5 Leagues from <HI>Buenos Ayres;</HI>
where I met with <HI>Ignatio Maleo,</HI> who
was got thither before me; he came thi|ther
by the River in a little Boat, which
we re&s;olv'd to make u&s;e of, to convey
mo&s;t of the Silver I had brought with
me, privately to our Ship; we thought
meet to take this Cour&s;e to avoid the
ri&s;que we mu&s;t have run of being Con|fi&s;cated,
if we had brought our Ve&s;&s;el by
<HI>Buenos Ayres,</HI> becau&s;e of the Prohibition
of the Exportation of Gold and Silver,
tho' this order is not always very regu|larly
ob&s;erv'd, the Governour &s;ometimes,
&s;uffering it to be carried out privately,
Conniving at it, for &s;ome pre&s;ent, or
el&s;e not being very &s;trict in taking no|tice
of it.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t not omit here to tell the rea|&s;on
why the <HI>Spaniards</HI> will not &s;uffer the
Silver of <HI>Peru,</HI> and of other Neighbouring
Provinces to be Tran&s;ported by the River
of <HI>la Plata,</HI> nor all &s;orts of Ve&s;&s;els to go
<PB N="64" REF="141">
and Trade there without Permi&s;&s;ion:
It is from this Con&s;ideration, that if
they &s;hould give way to a free Trade
on that &s;ide, where the Country is good
and Plentiful, the Earth Fruitful, The
Air whole&s;ome, and Carriage Commo|dious;
the Merchants that Trade in <HI>Pe|ru,
Chili,</HI> and <HI>Tucuman,</HI> would &s;oon
quit the way of the Gallions, and the
Ordinary Pa&s;&s;ages through the North
and South-Seas, and through the Conti|nent,
which is difficult and Incommodi|ous;
and would take the way of <HI>Bue|nos
Ayres:</HI> And this would infallibly
cau&s;e mo&s;t of the Cities of the Conti|nent
to be de&s;erted, where the Air is
bad, and the Nece&s;&s;aries and Accomo|dations
of Life are not to be had in &s;uch
plenty.</P>
<P>When we had &s;ecur'd our Silver by
the precaution we had us'd, I came to
<HI>Buenos Ayres</HI> with the re&s;t of our Goods;
where I was no &s;ooner Arriv'd, but our
return to <HI>Spain</HI> was re&s;olv'd on. But
lea&s;t any thing &s;hould be found on board
us to give occa&s;ion for any Seizure, when
the Kings Officers &s;hould make their u&s;u|al
Vi&s;it on our Ve&s;&s;el, before it went out
of the Port; we thought convenient at
fir&s;t to Embark only tho&s;e Commodities
<PB N="65" REF="141">
that took up the mo&s;t room, as <HI>Vigogne</HI>
Wool, Leather of &s;everal &s;orts, among&s;t
others 16000 Bulls-hides, with a great ma|ny
other Bales and Che&s;ts belonging to the
Pa&s;&s;engers that were to return with us, and
about 30000 Crowns in Silver, which is
the large&s;t Sum that is permitted to be carri|ed
away, to &s;upply all nece&s;&s;ary charges that
may occur in the Voyage, and to pay off
the Ship. But after this Vi&s;it was made,
we made an end of Embarking the Silver
we had hidden, which with the re&s;t of the
Lading might amount to about Three Mil|lions
of Livers.</P>
<P>We parted from <HI>Buenos Ayres</HI> in the Month
of <HI>May</HI> 1659, in company of a <HI>Dutch</HI>
Ve&s;&s;el, Commanded by <HI>I&s;aac de Brac,</HI> which
was al&s;o richly Laden; he engag'd us to
&s;teer our Cour&s;e with him, becau&s;e his Ship
leak'd; and this fault increa&s;ing in the &s;e|quel
of the Voyage, we were oblig'd to put
in at the I&s;land of <HI>Fernande de Lorona,</HI> with|in
3 Degrees and a half of the Line on the
South-&s;ide. It prov'd well for us, as well
as for the <HI>Dutch,</HI> that we &s;top'd here. For
having a mind for fear of the wor&s;t to take
in a new Provi&s;ion of Fre&s;h-Water here,
we perceiv'd the greate&s;t part of that we had
taken in at <HI>Buenos Ayres</HI> was run out, and
of a Hundred Barrels, which we thought we
had remaining of our Store; we had but
<PB N="66" REF="142">
Thirty left. Therefore tho' the Water we
found there had a very flat Ta&s;te, and had
this ill quality, that it pre&s;ently ca&s;t them
that drank of it into a Loo&s;ene&s;s, we were
however nece&s;&s;itated to fill our Barrels with
it. And an Accident unhappy enough
befell tho&s;e of our Men that went to fetch
it from the Rock out of which it &s;prang,
for having &s;tripp'd them&s;elves almo&s;t naked,
to work the more commodiou&s;ly, the heat
of the Sun &s;corch'd 'em &s;o vehemently, that
it made their Bodies all over red, and after|wards
tho&s;e parts upon which the Sun dart|ed
its Rays with the greate&s;t violence, were
full of Buboes and Pu&s;tules, which were
very trouble&s;ome, and made 'em very un|ea&s;ie
for a Fortnights Time.</P>
<P>I went a&s;hore to &s;ee this I&s;land, which is
about a League and an half in compa&s;s, and
uninhabited. One of our Pilots told me
that the <HI>Dutch</HI> po&s;&s;e&s;s'd it, while they held
<HI>Fermanbues</HI> in <HI>Bra&s;il,</HI> and that they had a
&s;mall Fort there, &s;ome &s;mall remains of
which were &s;till left, that they &s;ow'd Mil|let
and Beans there, of which they had a
tolerable Crop, and that they bred up a
great many Fowls, Goats and Hogs. We
&s;aw a great number of Birds, of which &s;ome
were good to eat; we continu'd there
Four days, but when we &s;aw the <HI>Dutch</HI>
could not be &s;o &s;oon in a condition to con|tinue
<PB N="67" REF="142">
their Voyage, being oblig'd to put
their Cargo a&s;hore, and to lay their Ve&s;&s;el
upon one &s;ide to refit; we &s;et &s;ail, and af|ter
a Voyage &s;ufficiently trouble&s;ome by
the Storms we &s;uffer'd, which &s;ometimes
drove us towards the Coa&s;ts of <HI>Florida,</HI> and
&s;ometimes upon others, we at la&s;t di&s;cover'd
the Coa&s;ts of <HI>Spain.</HI> In&s;tead of going to
<HI>Cadiz,</HI> being under apprehen&s;ions of meet|ing
the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> who were &s;till at War with
the <HI>Spaniards;</HI> we thought convenient to
make to <HI>St. Andero,</HI> where we happily ar|riv'd
about the middle of <HI>August.</HI> We were
immediatly inform'd that the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Galli|ons
came to Moor at the &s;ame Port in their
return from <HI>Mexico,</HI> for the &s;ame rea&s;on
that brought us thither, and that they &s;et
Sail but Two days before our Arrival. And
becau&s;e the Officers of the King of <HI>Spain,</HI>
that had been &s;ent to 'em were &s;till there,
we thought be&s;t to treat with them, as well
to &s;ave the Fine we had incurr'd, for not re|turning
to the place from whence we were
&s;ent out, as that we might not be troubled
with a vi&s;it from them. And for 4000 Pa|tagons,
which we pre&s;ented 'em, we were
excus'd and exempted from any &s;earch. We
therefore put our Silver and other Commo|dities
a&s;hore there, part of which was after|wards
&s;ent to <HI>Bilboa,</HI> and part to <HI>St. Seba&s;ti|an,</HI>
where in a little time they were &s;old
<PB N="68" REF="143">
and di&s;tributed to &s;everal Merchants, who
Tran&s;ported 'em to divers places to put 'em
off. When we had fini&s;hed the Sale of all
our Commodities, there was an exact account
&s;tated among tho&s;e that were concern'd in
the Ship, both of their Charge and Profit of
this Voyage; about the detail of which I
&s;hall not trouble my head. I &s;hall only &s;ay,
to give a &s;hort account of it in Gro&s;s, that
the Charge con&s;i&s;ted fir&s;t in 290000 Crowns
employ'd in buying the Goods with which
our Ve&s;&s;el was Loaded at <HI>Cadiz,</HI> and in pay|ing
the Dues of Exportation from <HI>Spain.
74000 Livers</HI> for the Freight of the Ve&s;&s;el
for 19 Months, at the rate of 3200 <HI>Livers
per</HI> Month, 43000 <HI>Livers</HI> more for the pay
of 76 Seamen great and &s;mall for the time,
at the rate of 10 Crowns <HI>per</HI> Month one
with another. 30000 Crowns &s;pent in
Victualling the Ship for that time, as well
for the Ships Crew as for the Pa&s;&s;engers,
there being a very good Provi&s;ion made, be|cau&s;e
in tho&s;e long Voyages beyond the
Line the Sailers mu&s;t have good Su&s;tenance,
and the Pa&s;&s;engers mu&s;t have a great many
Sweet-meats, good Liquors, and other Co&s;t|ly
things. More 2000 Crowns for the
Dues of Entry at <HI>Buenos Ayres,</HI> and in Pre|&s;ents
to the Officers of the Place; and 1000
Crowns in Cu&s;tom at our going from
thence; more in Expences, Impo&s;ts and
<PB N="69" REF="143">
Charges in carrying our Goods from <HI>Buenos
Ayres</HI> to <HI>Poto&s;i,</HI> and from <HI>Poto&s;i</HI> to <HI>Buenos
Ayres,</HI> at the rate of 20 Crowns for a Quin|tal
or 100 weight; more 4000 Crowns to
procure an Exemption from being &s;earch'd
and vi&s;ited at our return to <HI>Spain.</HI> And in
fine &s;ome other Expences, as well in Cu|&s;toms
of Entry, when we Landed our
Goods in <HI>Spain,</HI> as in &s;ome other things not
fore-&s;een, which did not amount to any
great Sums. The&s;e were almo&s;t all the
Principal Articles of the Charge, which
being deducted and paid, the Profit was
found to amount to 250 <HI>per Cent.</HI> Compre|hending
that which was got by the Hides,
which came to 15 <HI>Livers</HI> a piece, that being
the Ordinary Price, tho' they co&s;t but a
Crown at the fir&s;t hand; and likewi&s;e what
was got by the Pa&s;&s;engers, of whom we had
above 50 on board us, as well in going as
coming, which was not incon&s;iderable; for
one Man who had nothing but his Che&s;t
paid 800 Crowns, and the re&s;t paid propor|tionably
for their Pa&s;&s;age and Diet.</P>
<P>We were told at <HI>St. Andero,</HI> that the <HI>Dutch</HI>
Ve&s;&s;els which we had &s;een at <HI>Buenos Ayres</HI>
were &s;afely arriv'd at <HI>Am&s;terdam,</HI> but that
the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Emba&s;&s;ador being inform'd that
they came from the River <HI>de la Plata,</HI> and
had brought thence a prodigious Quantity
of Silver and other Commodities, as well
<PB N="70" REF="144">
on the account of &s;ome <HI>Dutch</HI> Merchants, as
for &s;everal <HI>Spaniards,</HI> who had taken the
opportunity of the return of the&s;e Ve&s;&s;els to
come back into <HI>Europe,</HI> and had remitted
their Money from <HI>Am&s;terdam</HI> to <HI>Cadiz</HI> and
<HI>Sevil</HI> by Bills of Exchange, be&s;ides the
<HI>Dutch</HI> Goods which they &s;ent thither, had
given advice of it to the Council for the <HI>In|dies</HI>
at <HI>Madrid,</HI> who judged this Money
and the&s;e Effects liable to Confi&s;cation, be|cau&s;e
all <HI>Spaniards</HI> are Prohibited from
Trading upon Forreign Ve&s;&s;els, and from
Tran&s;porting Silver to any other place be|&s;ides
<HI>Spain;</HI> and accordingly had &s;eiz'd and
confi&s;cated the greate&s;t part of 'em, the re&s;t
being &s;aved by the precautions &s;ome of the
Merchants took, who were not &s;o much in
ha&s;te as the others. The &s;ame Emba&s;&s;ador
having remon&s;trated at the &s;ame time, what
would be the Con&s;equence of Tolerating
Strangers to continue to trade in the River
of <HI>Plata,</HI> without putting any re&s;traint
upon 'em, the Council had &s;o much regard
to his advice, as to Equip a Ve&s;&s;el with all
&s;peed at <HI>St. Seba&s;tian,</HI> which they Loaded
with Arms and Men, to &s;end to <HI>Buenos
Ayres</HI> with very &s;trict orders, as well to &s;eize
the Per&s;on of the Governor for having &s;uf|fer'd
the&s;e <HI>Dutch</HI> Ve&s;&s;els to come and Trade
in the Country, as to take an exact account
of the Acquaintance and Intelligence the
<PB N="71" REF="144">
<HI>Dutch</HI> had gotten there, as al&s;o to ree&s;ta|bli&s;h
things &s;o well there, in fortifying the
Garri&s;ons, and in Arming them better than
they had yet been in time pa&s;t, that for the
Future they might be in a condition to re|&s;i&s;t
Forreigners, and to hinder their De|&s;cent
and Communication in the Country.
Soon after our Arrival, <HI>Ignatio Maleo</HI> the
Captain of our Ship, receiv'd an Order
from the Court of <HI>Spain</HI> to come to <HI>Madrid,</HI>
to inform the Council for the <HI>Indies</HI> of the
Condition in which he found and left
things at <HI>Buenos Ayres:</HI> He was de&s;irous
that I would accompany him thither, which
I did. As &s;oon as we arriv'd at <HI>Madrid,</HI> he
gave in the Memories, not only of all he
had ob&s;erv'd in the River of <HI>Plata,</HI> but
al&s;o of the means that might be us'd to hin|der
Strangers from having the lea&s;t thoughts
of Trading there, and that fir&s;t by keeping
Two good Men of War at the Mouth of
the River, to di&s;pute and hinder the Pa&s;|&s;age
of &s;uch Merchant Ships as &s;hould at|tempt
to go up to <HI>Buenos Ayres;</HI> in the
&s;econd place by &s;ending every Year Two
Ships Loaded with all things the People of
tho&s;e parts have occa&s;ion for. That being
this way &s;ufficiently &s;upply'd, they might
have no thoughts of favouring the de&s;cent
and entrance of Strangers, when they &s;hould
come thither. He moreover made a propo|&s;al
<PB N="72" REF="145">
of changing the u&s;ual Way of carrying
Goods, which are &s;ent to <HI>Peru,</HI> and brought
them by the Way of the Gallions; that it
might be &s;ettled on the River of <HI>Plata,</HI> from
whence he a&s;&s;ur'd 'em, the Carriage of 'em
by Land to <HI>Peru,</HI> would be more conveni|ently
perform'd, and at a cheaper Rate, as
well as with le&s;s Ri&s;que, than any other
Way. But of all the&s;e Propo&s;als the Coun|cil
of <HI>Spain</HI> reli&s;h'd only that of &s;ending
to <HI>Buenos-Ayres</HI> Two Ve&s;&s;els laden with
Commodities proper for the Country. And
<HI>Maleo</HI> having obtain'd a Grant, and a Com|mi&s;&s;ion
for this Purpo&s;e, upon the A&s;&s;u|rance
of it, we return'd to <HI>Guipu&s;coa,</HI> to
make Preparation for this Voyage, and to
&s;et our Affairs in order; which we &s;o well
di&s;patch'd, that in a little time, we had a
Ve&s;&s;el ready to &s;et &s;ail, which <HI>Maleo</HI> order'd
to be bought at <HI>Am&s;terdam,</HI> and to be
brought to the Port from whence we were
to go, being partly laden with <HI>Dutch,</HI> and
with other Commodities, taken up at <HI>Bay|onne,</HI>
St. <HI>Seba&s;tian,</HI> and <HI>Bilboa,</HI> bought in
gro&s;s at a Venture, in which Affair I was
employ'd, having undertaken it by <HI>Maleo</HI>'s
Commi&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>During the&s;e Preparations, and while
we waited for the Di&s;patch of the Grant,
that had been promis'd him by the Council
of <HI>Spain,</HI> it happen'd that the Baron of <HI>Va|teville</HI>
<PB N="73" REF="145">
being in ha&s;te to go into <HI>England,</HI>
in Quality of Amba&s;&s;ador from his Catho|lick
Maje&s;ty; and having Orders to make
u&s;e of the fir&s;t Ship that was ready to Sail,
took <HI>Maleo</HI>'s Ve&s;&s;el; which, yet &s;erv'd on|ly
to carry his Baggage, the King of Great
<HI>Britain</HI> having &s;ent him a Frigat at the &s;ame
time, in which he cro&s;s'd the Sea. During
the Stay, which <HI>Maleo</HI> was oblig'd to make
in <HI>England,</HI> he made new Provi&s;ion for his
Voyage to the <HI>Indies;</HI> and &s;eeing his Grant
was not yet &s;ent him, he thought it expe|dient
to take a Commi&s;&s;ion, from the Ba|ron
of <HI>Vateville,</HI> as Captain-General of the
Province of <HI>Guipu&s;coa,</HI> in my Name, and
that of <HI>Pa&s;coal Hiriarte,</HI> commanding his
Ship to go in pur&s;uit of the <HI>Portugue&s;e,</HI> on
the Coa&s;t of <HI>Brezil;</HI> that this might &s;erve
us for a Pretext, to go into the River of
<HI>Plata.</HI> Being fortified with this Order,
we embark'd, and having &s;topp'd at <HI>Havre
de Grace</HI> to &s;et <HI>N</HI>&mdash;a&s;hoar, who thought
good to return to <HI>Madrid,</HI> to &s;olicite a
Commi&s;&s;ion al&s;o from the Council of <HI>Spain,</HI>
for the Two Ve&s;&s;els, with which we agreed,
that they &s;hould come and joyn us at <HI>Bue|nos-Ayres;</HI>
we continued our Cour&s;e, and
after many cro&s;s Winds, we arriv'd in the
River of <HI>Plata:.</HI> As we enter'd into it, we
met Two <HI>Dutch</HI> Ve&s;&s;els that came from <HI>Bue|nos
Ayres;</HI> the Captains of which inform'd
<PB N="74" REF="146">
us, that one of 'em could by no means ob|tain
leave to Trade there; but that the o|ther
Arriving there before him, in a con|juncture
when the Government was oblig'd
to &s;end a very important Me&s;&s;age in all ha&s;te
to his Catholick Maje&s;ty, relating to his
Service, was &s;o happy, by the promi&s;e he
made of taking the Courrier, who was or|der'd
for <HI>Spain</HI> on board him, as to find
means of di&s;po&s;ing of all his Goods, and
of bringing away a very Rich Cargo, in
which he &s;pake the very Truth; for he had
the prudence before he came to the Port, to
take out his riche&s;t Goods, and leave 'em
in an I&s;land below, and only re&s;erv'd tho&s;e
of the greate&s;t bulk to be expos'd to the
View of the Officers, of which he had made
a fal&s;e Envois at the price of the Country,
&s;eparate from the general one, and had
made the Value of his Cargo to amount to
270000 Crowns. He agreed with the Go|vernor
to leave the&s;e Goods with him, pro|vided
he would give him for 'em 22000
Hides at a Crown apiece, 12000 pound of
<HI>Vigogne</HI> Wool at 4 <HI>Livers 10 Sous per</HI>
Pound, ane 30000 Crowns in Silver to pay
the Charges of Equipping his Ship; which
was perform'd accordingly. But under the
pretence of his Bargain, and while the Lea|ther
was Loading in the Ve&s;&s;el, the Cap|tain
under-hand &s;old his Riche&s;t Commo|dities,
<PB N="75" REF="146">
and for the Value of 'em which a|mounted
to 100000 Crowns, he got at lea&s;t
400000. Thus the Captain of the Ship
and the Governor both made a great Ad|vantage;
but this Governor who&s;e Name
is <HI>Don Alonza de Mercado</HI> and <HI>de Villacorta,</HI>
being a very di&s;intere&s;ted Man, and not at
all greedy of Money, declar'd that the Pro|fit
of this bu&s;ine&s;s was for the King his
Ma&s;ter, and gave him advice of it by this
Courrier.</P>
<P>Being &s;eparated from the&s;e Ve&s;&s;els, we
came to an Anchor before <HI>Buenos Ayres;</HI>
but for all the In&s;tances and Offers we could
make one time after another to this Go|vernor,
we could never obtain his Permi&s;|&s;ion
to put our Goods a&s;hore, and to expo&s;e
'em to Sale to the People of the Place; be|cau&s;e
we had no Licence for it from <HI>Spain.</HI>
He only con&s;ented to let us go into the
City from time to time to procure Victuals
for our Men, and &s;uch other Nece&s;&s;aries as
we wanted. He treated us with this Rigour
for Eleven Months, after which there hap|pen'd
an Occa&s;ion which oblig'd him to
u&s;e us better, and to enter into a &s;ort of an
Accommodation with us. There was ano|ther
<HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Ship in the Port, the &s;ame that
a Year before had brought Troops and
Arms from <HI>Spain,</HI> to reinforce the Gari&s;ons
of <HI>Buenos Ayres,</HI> and of <HI>Chili,</HI> of which I
<PB N="76" REF="147">
have &s;poken above; which contin'd here
all this time upon her own private bu&s;ine&s;s,
but the Captain that Commanded her could
not manage his Affairs with &s;o much &s;ecre|cy,
but it came to the Governor's Ear, that
he de&s;ign'd in prejudice of the Prohibition
that was made, to carry away a great
quantity of Silver, and indeed he &s;eiz'd on
a Sum of 113000 Crowns that was ju&s;t rea|dy
to be carry'd of, of which the Captain
could have no re&s;titution made; and fearing
a greater di&s;apointment, namely that he
&s;hould be &s;eiz'd, he &s;et Sail to return into
<HI>Spain,</HI> without waiting for any Letters for
his Catholick Maje&s;ty, with which the Go|uernor
would have intru&s;ted him, together
with the Information he had receiv'd
of the Intelligence the <HI>Dutch</HI> had gotten
in the Country, which he had a mind
to &s;end into <HI>Spain</HI> with all &s;peed, as
well as &s;ome Per&s;ons whom he had &s;eiz'd,
that were guilty of holding this Corre&s;pon|dence
with the <HI>Dutch,</HI> among whom there
was a Captain, nam'd <HI>Alberto Jan&s;on,</HI> a
<HI>Dutch</HI>-man. The flight of this <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Ve&s;|&s;el
therefore oblig'd the Governor to alter
his carriage toward us, and to facilitate the
Return of our Ve&s;&s;el, which he thought
good to make u&s;e of, for want of another
to carry his Letters and Pri&s;oners into <HI>Spain;</HI>
upon condition we would take upon us
<PB N="77" REF="147">
this Charge, he &s;uffer'd us after a tacite
manner to do our bu&s;ine&s;s, and to carry off
4000 Hides; but we having great Acquain|tance
with the Merchants of the Place, ma|nag'd
our Affairs &s;o well, that under the
Umbrage of this permi&s;&s;ion, we &s;old all
our Goods, and brought away a Rich Car|go,
in Silver, Hides, and other Commodi|ties,
after which without loo&s;ing any time
we took our Cour&s;e for <HI>Spain.</HI></P>
<P>At our Arrival in the River of <HI>Corunna</HI>
in <HI>Gallicia,</HI> we receiv'd Advice by the Let|ters
which <HI>N</HI>&mdash;&s;ent us to the Ports upon
all the Coa&s;ts, that there was an Order from
the King of <HI>Spain</HI> to &s;eize us at our return,
becau&s;e we had been at <HI>Buenos Ayres</HI> with|out
leave. Upon this we re&s;olv'd (after
we had &s;ent the Letters and Pri&s;oners, that
were committed to our Charge to the Go|vernor
of <HI>Corunna</HI> by the hand of the Ser|geant
Major of <HI>Buenos Ayres,</HI> who came a|bout
the Affairs of that Country in our
Ve&s;&s;el) to pa&s;s out of that River, and to
go 6 Leagnes from thence into the Road
of <HI>Barias,</HI> where I found a &s;mall Ve&s;&s;el, in
which I loaded the greate&s;t part of what I
had on my own account, and that of my
Friends. The Governor of <HI>Corunna</HI> re|ceiving
advice of it, di&s;patch'd a Hoy af|ter
me to &s;top me, but I us'd that precauti|on
and diligence, that this Hoy could ne|ver
<PB N="78" REF="148">
come up with me, &s;o that I happily ar|riv'd
in <HI>France</HI> at the Port of <HI>Socca,</HI> where
I by this means &s;av'd the fruit of my La|bours
and long Voyage. The great Ship
which I left in the Road of <HI>Barias</HI> had not
&s;o favourable a Lot, and one may &s;ay, was
&s;hip-wrack'd at the very Port; for having
left the Road of <HI>Barias,</HI> to get &s;peedily to
that of <HI>Santonge,</HI> to &s;ecure all the Goods
&s;he had on board, except 4000 Hides, of
which her Bill of Lading gave an account,
and having begun to put 600 Hides into a
<HI>Dutch</HI> Ve&s;&s;el that &s;he met there, the bad
Weather con&s;train'd her to put in at the
Port from whence &s;he fir&s;t went out, where
&s;he was Confi&s;cated with all her Cargo for
the u&s;e of the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> under the pre|tence
before &s;poken of, that &s;he had not the
Permi&s;&s;ion of his Catholick Maje&s;ty for her
Voyage.</P>
<P>While the&s;e things were tran&s;acting, the
Sergeant Major of <HI>Buenos Ayres</HI> Arriv'd at
<HI>Madrid,</HI> and the King of <HI>Spain</HI> having
Cau&s;ed the Informations he brought to be
examin'd, which principally in&s;i&s;ted upon
the nece&s;&s;ity there was of &s;ending new Re|cruits
of Men and Ammunition, to aug|ment
the Cari&s;ons of <HI>Buenos Ayres,</HI> and of
<HI>Chili,</HI> the better to &s;ecure the Country a|gain&s;t

<PB N="79" REF="148">
immediately orderd Three Ve&s;&s;els to be
Equipp'd for this purpo&s;e, the Command

good &s;tore of Ammunition Embark'd in
'em, but for Recruits of Souldiers, there
were but 300 Men, of whom the greate&s;t

agreed to have a &s;ecret Enterview upon the
Frontiers; accordingly we met, and gave

<SALUTE>Reverend Father,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE Di&s;covery that I and Father <HI>Be|chamel,</HI>
have made of divers Savage
Nations on the Continent of <HI>Guiana,</HI> near the
I&s;land of <HI>Cayenne,</HI> obliges me to draw up a
brief Relation of our Voyage, and to pre&s;ent it to
your Reverence, that you may know what Em|ployment
we may have here, and how many
Mi&s;&s;ionaries may find a fit Occa&s;ion for the Ex|erci&s;e
of their Zeal. If I had had &s;ome Com|panions
whom I might have left with the <HI>Nou|ragues</HI>
and the <HI>Acoquas,</HI> I &s;hould have pierc'd
much farther into the Country; but the <HI>Nou|ragues</HI>
who were our Guides, not daring to ad|vance
farther into the Country of the <HI>Acoquas,</HI> to
retain the good will of 'em both, we &s;hould have
left a Mi&s;&s;ionary in each of the&s;e Nations, that
the <HI>Acoquas</HI> might have conducted us to their
Friends, who (as far as I can conjecture) reach
quite to the <HI>Equinoctial Line.</HI> We might al&s;o
have pa&s;s'd to the We&s;t of the River <HI>Maroni,</HI>
and have enter'd into an Alliance with the Na|tions
that extend to the River of <HI>Surinam,</HI>
upon which the <HI>Dutch</HI> have planted (1) a Co|lony:
<PB REF="151">
but &s;ince we have confin'd our &s;elves to
tho&s;e Countries that are from Three Degrees of
Northern Latitude to the <HI>Equinoctial Line,</HI>
we need not be afraid that the People of any
<HI>European</HI> Nation will trouble us in our Mi&s;|&s;ions,
becau&s;e there's no gain to be made by
'em; be&s;ides, that we run the ri&s;que of being
Ma&s;&s;acred by the Natives. 'Tis from your
Reverence that we expect Support and A&s;&s;i&s;t|ance
&s;o far as you are capable, and &s;hall think
convenient in &s;ending us Mi&s;&s;ionaries of a Vi|gorous
Con&s;titution, of great Vertue, and of a
Di&s;po&s;ition ready to &s;uffer hard&s;hips; becau&s;e
in the&s;e parts there can little or no Accommoda|tions
be brought to relieve them in ca&s;e of Sick|ne&s;s;
for the le&s;s one carries thither &s;o much
the better; be&s;ides that the Ignorance and Bar|barity
of tho&s;e People always give a Mi&s;&s;ionary
ju&s;t occa&s;ion to fear, that they take up mi&s;chie|vous
Re&s;olutions against him at the very fir&s;t
&s;hadow of di&s;&s;atisfaction they receive. I ex|pect
here a good number of Mi&s;&s;ionaries to di&s;|po&s;e
up and down this va&s;t Country; and I
hope your Reverence will not refu&s;e this Re|que&s;t;
which obliges me particularly to recom|mend
my &s;elf to your good Prayers, who am</P>

<P>THE Reverend Father <HI>Francis Mer|cier</HI>
having been &s;ent from <HI>France,</HI>
in Quality of Vi&s;itor of the Mi&s;&s;i|ons
of our Society, both in the I&s;lands,
and Continent of the Southern <HI>America,</HI> by
the Reverend Father, <HI>John Pinet,</HI> Provin|cial
of the Je&s;uits in <HI>France;</HI> with the
Reverend Father <HI>Gerard Brion,</HI> Superior-General
of the &s;aid Mi&s;&s;ions, and Father
<HI>Mace,</HI> and Father <HI>Alarole;</HI> he arriv'd in the
I&s;land of <HI>Cayenne</HI> the <HI>21&s;t</HI> of <HI>December,</HI> 1673.
and parted thence Ten Days after: Du|ring
his Stay there, he regulated divers
Affairs, as well Temporal as Spiritual; and
among other Things, finding we had yet
no Knowledge of any other People, but
the <HI>Galibis,</HI> and <HI>Aracarels,</HI> our Neighbours,
who dwell near the Sea, and among whom
<PB N="2" REF="152">
the Fathers of our Society employ'd their
Talents, with abundance of Zeal; he re|&s;olv'd
to attempt a Di&s;covery of tho&s;e Na|tions
that lie remote from the Sea. It was
my Happine&s;s to be cho&s;en for &s;o pious a
Work; and I was particularly in&s;tructed
by my Orders, to di&s;cover the <HI>Acoquas,</HI> a
very populous Nation, according to the
Report, &s;ome <HI>Nouragues,</HI> who frequent the
<HI>Galibis,</HI> gave us; withal, telling us, they
were a Warlike People, and us'd to eat
Men. One of the&s;e <HI>Nouragues</HI> being ask'd,
Two Months before the Arrival of the Re|verend
Father-Vi&s;itor, <HI>If it were true, that
the</HI> Acoquas <HI>us'd to eat their Enemies,</HI> an|&s;wer'd,
<HI>That he came from 'em Four Months
ago, and then they had just made an end of
boiling in their Pots, and eating a Nation,
which they had de&s;troy'd.</HI> I de&s;ir'd the Re|verend
Father, <HI>Francis Bechamel,</HI> for my
Comrade, who has a great Deal of Zeal
for the&s;e Mi&s;&s;ions, and has an extraordina|ry
Faculty of learning &s;trange Languages;
be&s;ides that, he already under&s;tood the
Tongue of the <HI>Galibis,</HI> which many of the
<HI>Nouragues</HI> al&s;o &s;peak; &s;ome of whom we
were oblig'd to take for our Guides, to
conduct us to the <HI>Acoquas;</HI> for we yet
know no other Way to come at 'em, but
through the Country of the <HI>Nouragues:</HI> And
Father <HI>Bechamel</HI> took care to provide &s;ome
<PB N="3" REF="152">
<HI>Galibis,</HI> to conduct us to the <HI>Nouragues,</HI>
who dwell above the Source of the River
(2) <HI>&V;via,</HI> and to buy &s;ome <HI>Ca&s;&s;ave</HI> and
<HI>Pa&s;te</HI> of (3) <HI>Ovicou</HI> for his Voyage, which
we counted would be for about Ten Days.</P>
<P>This Father having provided all Nece&s;|&s;aries;
namely, Three <HI>Galibis,</HI> &s;ome <HI>Ca&s;&s;ave,</HI>
and <HI>Pa&s;te</HI> of <HI>Ovicou,</HI> in hopes of finding
by the good Providence of God, either Fi&s;h,
or Veni&s;on, with the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of our <HI>Indi|ans,</HI>
we left the Port of <HI>Cayenne</HI> the <HI>25th</HI>
of <HI>January,</HI> taking our Leave of the Reve|rend
Father <HI>Brion,</HI> Superior-General, and
Father <HI>Mace,</HI> and Father <HI>Bechet;</HI> but par|ticularly
of the (4) <HI>Chevalier de Lezy,</HI> our
Governour, who did us the Honour to con|duct
us together, with the Fathers of our
Society, quite to the <HI>Canoo,</HI> in which we
embark'd in the Afternoon, having our Fi|&s;herman
to &s;teer the <HI>Canoo,</HI> and Three <HI>In|dian
Galibis</HI> to row with our Two Ser|vants.
All of us were of Opinion, That
our <HI>Canoo</HI> was too &s;mall, and indeed it
would have prov'd &s;o, if we had embark|ed
at the coming up of the Tide, for at that
time the Waves are very rough near the
Shoar; but we avoided this Danger by em|barking
a little before the Tide came up;
&s;o that we were out of all danger when the
Tide began to drive us into the River,
which gives its Name to this I&s;land; be|&s;ides,
<PB N="4" REF="153">
our <HI>Canoo</HI> being very light, and not
ea&s;ie to be turn'd, was very fit to get clear
of &s;everal little Falls that are in the River
<HI>&V;via,</HI> which we were to pa&s;s almo&s;t quite
through, 'till we came to the Entrance of
a le&s;&s;er River, that let us into the Country
of the <HI>Nouragues,</HI> the fir&s;t Nation that we
were willing to be acquainted with, that
by their Means we might find a Pa&s;&s;age to
the <HI>Acoquas.</HI> Our Way was between the
I&s;land of <HI>Cayenne,</HI> and the main Land; and
in the Evening we arriv'd at the Hou&s;e of
one <HI>De&s;lauriers,</HI> that had &s;ettled him&s;elf
there; we continued with him for a certain
Rea&s;on, all the next Day, being the <HI>26th</HI> of
<HI>January.</HI> Since God was pleas'd to protect
and lead us by the Hand, as it were in all
this Voyage; we mu&s;t confe&s;s, that it was
he who in&s;pir'd us with the Re&s;olution to
begin it by the River <HI>&V;via;</HI> for we knew
but two Ways of entering into the Coun|try
of the <HI>Nouragues,</HI> one by the River <HI>&V;via,</HI>
and t'other by the River (5) <HI>Aproague;</HI> this
la&s;t is very difficult, becau&s;e the Falls of the
Water are &s;o great, that the <HI>Sapayes,</HI> and
<HI>Galibis,</HI> that live at the Mouth of this Ri|ver,
require a very large Reward to per|form
this Voyage; and indeed, are the
more unwilling to undertake it, becau&s;e
they are afraid of tho&s;e <HI>Nouragues,</HI> that eat
Humane Fle&s;h: So, that when any of 'em
<PB N="5" REF="153">
go into tho&s;e Parts, they &s;tay there as little
time as they can: Therefore it is &s;carce po&s;|&s;ible
to go this Way, and if we had gone
it, we &s;hould have been altogether unac|quainted
with tho&s;e <HI>Indians,</HI> that dwell
on the Coa&s;ts of the River <HI>&V;via,</HI> and with
the <HI>Nouragues</HI> that dwell above the Source
of it. But without knowing any thing of
this before, we cho&s;e to pa&s;s into the Coun|try
of the <HI>Nouragues,</HI> by the <HI>&V;via,</HI> and have
this Way vi&s;ited that whole Nation.</P>
<P>The <HI>27th</HI> of <HI>January</HI> we left the Sieur
<HI>De&s;lauriers</HI> &s;omewhat late, and therefore
proceeded but a little way that Day: Our
<HI>Galibis</HI> brought us into a Hut of the (6)
<HI>Maprouanes,</HI> as well to &s;helter us from a
great Shower of Rain, as to lodge us
(7) there that Night. The&s;e <HI>Maprouanes</HI>
are about Thirty in Number, who retir'd
from their Country, near the River of <HI>A|mazons,</HI>
to avoid the Per&s;ecution of the
<HI>Portuge&s;e,</HI> and of tho&s;e <HI>Indians</HI> call'd the
(8) <HI>Arianes,</HI> who have almo&s;t extirpated
that Nation: We found nothing there but
<HI>Ca&s;&s;ave</HI> and <HI>Ovicou;</HI> and to the <HI>6th</HI> of <HI>Fe|bruary,</HI>
we had nothing but <HI>Ca&s;&s;ave,</HI> be&s;ides
Two Fi&s;hes, and a Couple of Fowls, which
the <HI>Galibis</HI> took, (which &s;erv'd us for Four
&s;mall Meals) and a little Piece of Fi&s;h we
met with at another <HI>Indian</HI> Cottage.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="154">
The <HI>28th</HI> we arriv'd at a Mountain, where
a certain <HI>Galibi,</HI> nam'd <HI>Maure,</HI> dwells;
this is Twelve Leagues from the Mouth of
the <HI>&V;via:</HI> And Two Leagues below this
Mountain, the Land upon the River, which
is hitherto very low, and almo&s;t always
overflow'd, is a high, fine Country, as far
as the Dwelling of the fir&s;t <HI>Nouragues.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>29th</HI> we lay in a Wood, and &s;o we
did on the <HI>30th,</HI> having pa&s;s'd by a Vil|lage
of the <HI>Galibi</HI>'s, which contain'd but
very few People, to make the bigger Day's
Journey.</P>
<P>The <HI>31&s;t</HI> we lodg'd in a <HI>Galibi</HI>'s Cot|tage,
who&s;e Family con&s;i&s;ted of about Six
or Seven, but Three or Four of 'em were
ab&s;ent.</P>
<P>The Fir&s;t of <HI>February</HI> we pa&s;s'd the Night
in the Woods, and on the Second we lay
at a <HI>Galibi</HI>'s Cottage again; and this was
the poore&s;t, and mo&s;t pitiful Hut that ever
I &s;aw among the <HI>Indians</HI> of this Country;
there was in it only one Man, and his Wife
and Children, who had nothing at all that
Day to &s;up on. One of their Children
was much &s;well'd, and in a langui&s;hing
Condition, with a continual Fever, of
which we thought it could never recover;
therefore Father <HI>Bechamel</HI> baptiz'd it; and
the Con&s;olation this gave us &s;weeten'd all
our pa&s;t Hard&s;hips.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="154">
The Third we went a&s;hoar in the Coun|try
of the <HI>Nouragues,</HI> after having this Day,
and the Day before pa&s;s'd Three Falls in
the River <HI>&V;via,</HI> and another in the River
of the <HI>Nouragues;</HI> but this was nothing in
compari&s;on of the Falls of Water we were
to pa&s;s on the Rivers of <HI>Aproague</HI> and <HI>Ca|mopi.</HI></P>
<P>And it was now time to land, for our (9)
<HI>Ca&s;&s;ave</HI> would have been &s;pent if we had
had but a little farther to go in tho&s;e great
De&s;arts, and va&s;t Fore&s;ts, that are all along
upon this River; upon which there are
no other Cottages but tho&s;e I have been
&s;peaking of, and tho&s;e of &s;ome <HI>Galibis</HI> and
<HI>Areacarets,</HI> who live towards the Mouth
of it, and are in all about a Hundred or
Six&s;core Per&s;ons. This River winds very
much, and runs a Cour&s;e of near Fifty
Leagues.</P>
<P>Our <HI>Galibis</HI> &s;erv'd us in this Voyage with
a great deal of Re&s;pect, and gave us Acce&s;s
to the Chief of the&s;e fir&s;t <HI>Nouragues,</HI> to
whom we pre&s;ented a Hatchet, to engage
him to enter into an Alliance with us; they
did not remember, that they had &s;een above
One <HI>French</HI> Man before in their Country;
&s;o that the Women and Girls, who had ne|ver
travell'd into the Country of the <HI>Gali|bis,</HI>
were mightily amaz'd at the Sight of
us. If one might judge of the whole Na|tion
<PB N="8" REF="155">
by the&s;e People, one might very well
&s;ay, the <HI>Nouragues</HI> are a very courteous and
affable People. Some of 'em could &s;peak
the Language of the <HI>Galibis</HI> very well, and
&s;erv'd for our Interpreters. They did all they
could to &s;eek Provi&s;ion, to treat us well;
but being un&s;ucce&s;sful in their Hunting, we
had only <HI>Ca&s;&s;ave,</HI> and a little Meat at one
of our Repa&s;ts, but with great Demon&s;tra|tions
of their Kindne&s;s. We bought <HI>Ca&s;&s;ave</HI>
of 'em for the Supply of the Men that be|long
to our <HI>Canoo;</HI> and on the Sixth of
<HI>February,</HI> after the <HI>Galibis</HI> had been treated
with a &s;mall Fea&s;t after the Fa&s;hion of the
Country, they parted from us at about Ten
a Clock in the Morning.</P>
<P>We al&s;o left this fir&s;t Cottage of the <HI>Nou|ragues,</HI>
on the Seventh of <HI>February,</HI> to go
a Journey of Four and Twenty Leagues by
Land, over very rugged Mountains; but
went only half a League from thence to
lodge that Night, being attended with Two
young <HI>Nouragues,</HI> each of about Sixteen
or Seventeen Years of Age, who were to
carry our Baggage; here we were to take
another Man, who had promis'd to carry
our Provi&s;ion for us, which con&s;i&s;ted of
<HI>Ca&s;&s;ave,</HI> and <HI>Pa&s;te</HI> of <HI>Ovicou:</HI> This Man's
Wife, in this Second Hut, was ill of a Can|cer
in her Brea&s;t, which &s;o tormented her,
and had &s;o exceedingly wa&s;ted her, that
<PB N="9" REF="155">
&s;eeing her under &s;o terrible a Di&s;temper,
without the Help of any Medicine, we &s;up|pos'd
&s;he could not recover, and that in
Probability, &s;he would live morally the
re&s;t of her Days; for the&s;e People endure
their Pains and Hard&s;hips very patiently, as
we ob&s;erv'd in all the <HI>Galibis;</HI> therefore we
re&s;olv'd to baptize her: In order to this,
Father <HI>Bechamel</HI> took care to in&s;truct her,
having already made &s;ome Improvement
in the Language of this People, and had
likewi&s;e the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of one of our young
<HI>Nouragues,</HI> who under&s;tood the <HI>Galibis</HI>
Tongue. This poor &s;ick Woman receiv'd
his In&s;tructions very well, and was bapti|zed,
which was an occa&s;ion of great Com|fort
to us.</P>
<P>The Eighth, having Bread and Pa&s;te of
<HI>Ovicou</HI> enough to &s;erve us Four Days, we
&s;et forward with our Three <HI>Nouragues,</HI> to
perform our Journey of Four and Twenty
Leagues, over Mountains all the way, which
the <HI>Nouragues</HI> &s;ometimes perform in a Day
and a half; but ordinarily in Two or
Three Days, when they have Women in
their Company. One of our <HI>French</HI> Men
of <HI>Cayenne,</HI> that came thence on the <HI>27th</HI>
of <HI>January,</HI> follow'd us clo&s;ely with Seven
<HI>Galibis,</HI> and overtook us where we lodg'd
the Second Night, who gave me a Letter
from the Reverend Father <HI>Brion,</HI> our Su|perior
<PB N="10" REF="156">
written the day he came away,
which gave us no &s;mall joy, for it con|tain'd
a great deal of Good Advice, that
might be &s;erviceable to us in our Expedi|tion.</P>
<P>This <HI>French</HI>-Man was much fatigu'd with
his Journey, and &s;ent his <HI>Indians</HI> before him
the day following, who in that one day be|ing
the Tenth of <HI>February,</HI> went as much
ground as we could do in a day and a half,
by rea&s;on of the difficulty of the ways. He
having joyn'd him&s;elf to our Company, and
comparing our <HI>Nouragues</HI> with his <HI>Galibis,</HI>
found a great alteration, and could not
but admire the Meekne&s;s and Patience of
the&s;e Three <HI>Indians,</HI> but e&s;pecially their
Re&s;pect. They carry'd our Provi&s;ions, yet
they dur&s;t not take any without asking, tho'
we had often told 'em that they might take
of 'em when they pleas'd. This day we
pa&s;&s;ed the River <HI>Aratay,</HI> which throws it
&s;elf into the <HI>Aproague.</HI> The <HI>Aratay</HI> is a fine
River, which comes from a Country that
is Situate between the Source of the River
<HI>&V;via</HI> and the County of the <HI>Mercious,</HI> which
the <HI>Nouragues</HI> &s;ay is a &s;pace of Land that
extends about Seven days Journey. We
were forc'd to pa&s;s this River <HI>Aratay</HI> which
is pretty wide and deep, and the Stream of
which is &s;omewhat Rapid, in a little <HI>Canoo,</HI>
in much danger of being ca&s;t away, as this
<PB N="11" REF="156">
<HI>French</HI>-Man that joyn'd us happen'd to be,
when he repa&s;s'd it in his return, where he
lo&s;t what he carry'd with him; which
was all he had in the World. After this
we lodg'd a third time in the Woods, and
on the Eleventh of <HI>February,</HI> being very
weary we about Noon Arriv'd at the Cot|tage
of <HI>Imanon</HI> the <HI>Nourague</HI> a Famous
(10) <HI>Piaye</HI> (or Phy&s;ician) in all that Coun|try,
where we found the <HI>Galibis</HI> that had
advanc'd before us the preceding day.
The&s;e <HI>Galibis</HI> mutinied again&s;t this poor
<HI>French</HI>-Man, and probably were the occa|&s;ion
of hindring the <HI>Nouragues</HI> of that place
from &s;elling any thing to him; &s;o that he
lo&s;t his Journey. Nay he was oblig'd to
entreat one of our <HI>Nourague</HI> Guides to car|ry
part of his Iron Wares, which he
brought to trade with, becau&s;e the&s;e <HI>Galibis</HI>
refus'd to help him. And there was no re|medy
for it but Patience, &s;ince he was 80
Leagues from <HI>Cayenne,</HI> in a Nation that had
no Commerce with the <HI>French.</HI></P>
<P>We did not part with our Three Guides
without regret; but we could not detain
'em, becau&s;e they were oblig'd to return for
&s;everal good Rea&s;ons. The Principal of
'em who&s;e Name was <HI>Paratou,</HI> told us, for
our comfort, that in the place where we
now were, which they call <HI>Caraoribo,</HI> from
the Name of a little River that pa&s;&s;es by it,
<PB N="12" REF="157">
we &s;hould find a great many <HI>Paratous,</HI> he
meant a great many <HI>Nouragues,</HI> as good
humor'd as him&s;elf. But we found a great
deal of difference in the Temper of tho&s;e
Guides we had from <HI>Caraoribo</HI> to the <HI>Aco|quas,</HI>
and of tho&s;e we had before.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as the&s;e had left us, we enter'd
into a good Corre&s;pondence with the Chief
<HI>Camiati</HI> the Father of <HI>Imanon,</HI> by pre&s;enting
him with a Hatchet; this is a very Famous
Chief, and the Principal one the <HI>Nouragues</HI>
have, and the next to him in Eminence, is
the Chief of the <HI>Nouragues</HI> of <HI>&V;via.</HI> This
<HI>Camiati</HI> the day after our Arrival came to
his Son's Cottage, (for his own is upon the
River <HI>Aproague</HI>) he may be about 60 Years
of Age, and &s;eems to be &s;till very Vigo|rous:
His Countenace tho' lean has a War|like
Mien, but withal he has a Savage A&s;|pect;
his Humour is but very indifferent to|ward
Strangers, tho' mild enough toward his
own People, to whom according to the Fa|&s;hion
of the Country, he every day gives
the Good-morrow, and the Good-night,
from the Olde&s;t People to Children of
Fifteen Years of Age. He promis'd us to con|duct
us quite to the <HI>Acoquas,</HI> when his <HI>Canoo</HI>
was made, to who&s;e Country he pretended
he would go him&s;elf, and de&s;ir'd but the
&s;pace of Ten Days to fini&s;h this <HI>Canoo;</HI> now
tho' we knew well enough after what man|ner
<PB N="13" REF="157">
the <HI>Indians</HI> us'd to reckon, who are
often Three Months in doing what they
might perform in the &s;pace of Ten Days:
we re&s;olv'd however to continue with him
to have the advantage of being under his
Protection; and to per&s;wade him, if we
&s;hould find him make too long a delay, to
borrow another <HI>Canoo,</HI> that was at Five
Days Journy di&s;tance from us; and in the
mean time to acquaint our &s;elves with
the Language of the <HI>Nouragues</HI> as much as we
could, which (as we were told) differ'd but
little from that of the <HI>Acoquas</HI> and <HI>Mercious.</HI>
The Language of the <HI>Galibis,</HI> which &s;ome of
us under&s;tood, and which was very Familiar
to Father <HI>Bechamel</HI> was &s;ome help to us on
this Occa&s;ion. This <HI>Nouragues</HI> Tongue is
not of an ea&s;ie and &s;oft Pronunciation like
that of the <HI>Galibis,</HI> but has a great number of
Words that mu&s;t be pronounc'd with very
rough A&s;pirations, others of 'em can't be
pronounc'd without &s;hutting the Teeth; at
another time one mu&s;t &s;peak through the
No&s;e; and &s;ometimes the&s;e Three difficul|ties
all occur in the &s;ame Word.</P>
<P>Father <HI>Bechamel</HI> immediately began to
apply him&s;elf to the &s;tudy of this Lan|guage;
and I made &s;o much advantge of
his Labour in which he &s;ucceeded to admi|ration,
that by means of the <HI>Galibis</HI> Lan|guage
I made a &s;mall Di&s;cour&s;e of the Cre|ation
<PB N="14" REF="158">
of the World; to make the&s;e People
know &s;omething of their Creator. <HI>Imanon</HI>
the Ma&s;ter of this Hut was the fir&s;t that
took delight in hearing this Di&s;cour&s;e, and
after him the Chief him&s;elf; and Five or
Six others, as they were working would
repeat in that very indiffent <HI>Galibis</HI>
I could &s;peak, the&s;e Words; <HI>God made
the Heavens, God made the Earth,</HI> &amp;c. Here
were many Men that had each of 'em Two
Wives, and one of 'em who had Three;
this did not hinder me from telling 'em in
the Account I gave 'em of the Creation of
Mankind; that God made but one Woman
for the Fir&s;t Man, and that he did not al|low
one Man to have Two Wives. And
tho' all the&s;e <HI>Nouragues</HI> perceiv'd we con|demn'd
their Cu&s;tom of taking Two or
Three Wives at a time, yet they &s;aid not a
word again&s;t the Chri&s;tian Law for not in|dulging
the &s;ame Liberty.</P>
<P>Seeing the&s;e People &s;o docile and pliable,
I was willing to try if the Songs of the
Church would plea&s;e 'em, and accordingly
I &s;ang the <HI>Magnificat</HI> in the fir&s;t Tune, Fa|ther
<HI>Bechamel</HI> and our Two Servants joyn|ing
in with me. This was &s;o grateful
to 'em, that afterwards we ordinarily &s;ang
&s;ome Hymns three-times a day to their
great &s;atisfaction. Nay &s;ome of 'em learn'd
to an&s;wer to the <HI>Litanies</HI> of the Ble&s;&s;ed Vir|gin,
<PB N="15" REF="158">
which we &s;ang every Evening. In
the mean while our Chief's <HI>Canoo</HI> went
forward but very (11) &s;lowly, and we
thought we had mnch better endeavour to
prevail with him to borrow another, with
which he comply'd, and &s;ent Two of his
Men for this end Five Days Journey
from his Hou&s;e, to get a convenient one
for us.</P>
<P>It was the Twenty eighth of <HI>February,</HI>
when the&s;e Men parted from us, and &s;ee|ing
him the next day which was the Fir&s;t
of <HI>March</HI> di&s;patch away another Company
of his Men, we thought convenient to
make u&s;e of this occa&s;ion to engage &s;ome of
'em to carry our Baggage, whom Father
<HI>Bechamel</HI> accompany'd, together with one
of our Servants, while I and our other Ser|vant
remain'd with the Chief, that we
might give him no offence; becau&s;e we
&s;tood in need of his Protection.</P>
<P>After I had continu'd a Fortnight with
him, making all the Children &s;ay their
Prayers Morning and Evening, and repeat|ing
my little In&s;tru&s;tions to the greate&s;t
part of tho&s;e I was acquainted with, but
e&s;pecially to Three Young Men who were
well Marry'd, confirming 'em in the Re&s;o|lution
they had made never to take a Se|cond
Wife; of which promi&s;e they &s;eem'd
to make no difficulty. I &s;et forward the
<PB N="16" REF="159">
Fifteenth of <HI>March,</HI> to &s;eek Father <HI>Bechamel,</HI>
and to wait for the Chief of the Cottage,
who was to go by Water Five days after
with his <HI>Canoo;</HI> I had but Three Leagues to
go by Land, whereas it was near Fifteen by
Water. From that time I found tho&s;e Peo|ple
&s;till more teachable, and when the
Captain return'd, among Four and twenty
Per&s;ons, there were not above Three, but
&s;ignified they took a great deal of plea&s;ure
in my In&s;tructions. During our &s;tay here,
a Serpent came in the Night in the place
where we lay, and bit a Hound, &s;o that he
died in 30 Hours after. This Accident was
Injurious to us, becau&s;e the Chief, and the
Owner of the Dog attributed it to the Pray|ers
which we &s;ang; &s;o that I dur&s;t not
Sing any more, but contented my &s;elf to
make every body in the Cottage &s;ay their
Prayers, except three (as I &s;aid before)
namely the Chief <HI>Camiati</HI> and Two other
Old Men.</P>
<P>The Ninth of <HI>April,</HI> after I had much
importun'd the Chief, that we might &s;et
forward; he told us, he was not willing to
make this Voyage, and that all his Men
&s;hould go to &s;et us in our way, and &s;hould
leave us when we went a&s;hore to go by
Land to the Rivers that lead to the <HI>Acoquas,</HI>
whether Four of the Company &s;hould at|tend
us. We under&s;tood that their Voy|age
<PB N="17" REF="159">
was determin'd without any regard to
us; however we did not &s;cruple to pay 'em
for it, being willing to make u&s;e of this
Opportunity, becau&s;e it was no ea&s;ie matter
to meet with another. However I oppos'd
the De&s;ign of having &s;o many Men go with
us, becau&s;e the Two <HI>Canoos</HI> they had were
too &s;mall for &s;uch a Company: This was
a great difficulty with us, and was not re|&s;olv'd
till the next day, when we repre&s;ent|ed
to the Chief, that we would leave
him our little Che&s;t, that we would take
very few of our (12) things out of it for
our Voyage, that when we return'd I would
continue with him; that if he was not
pleas'd to a&s;&s;i&s;t us in our Voyage, I mu&s;t re|turn
to <HI>Cayenne,</HI> that then he mu&s;t never
expect to &s;ee any of us again, and would
have no more of our Commodities; this
made him re&s;olve to le&s;&s;en the number of
his Men.</P>
<P>The Tenth of <HI>March</HI> we parted, being
Sixteen in Number, of which the Chief
would needs be one for Three days, that
he might bring back his <HI>Canoo.</HI> In the E|vening
we went a&s;hore into the Woods,
and on the Eleventh, after we had pa&s;s'd
&s;everal Falls of Waters in the way we made
the Two days, we Arriv'd at a Cottage of
the <HI>Nouragues,</HI> Ten Leagues from the for|mer;
here we were well receiv'd, and went
<PB N="18" REF="160">
forward the Third day with a Third <HI>Canoo</HI>
which was very &s;mall; it carry'd only Two
Men, a Woman, and a Girl of Ten or
Twelve Years Old. We pa&s;&s;ed Two Falls
that were difficult enough, and Arriv'd at
a Third, which the <HI>Canoo</HI> could not pa&s;s,
which has oblig'd the <HI>Nouragues</HI> to make a
way to draw their <HI>Canoos</HI> by Land almo&s;t
half a League, this fall is at Two Degrees, and
Forty Six Minutes of Northern Latitude.
The <HI>Indians</HI> drew only the little <HI>Canoo</HI> by
Land; for the Chief left us and return'd
back with the Two others; and we who
were then Fifteen in Number went to Em|bark
in a great <HI>Canoo,</HI> that was above the
Water-fall, which the Two Per&s;ons that
were &s;ent by <HI>Camiati</HI> had borrow'd; Four
Leagues higher, we found the Mouth of
the River <HI>Tenaporibo:</HI> and went to lie in a
Cottage hard by, which was yet upon the
River <HI>Aproague,</HI> where we found Five <HI>Nou|rague</HI>
Travellers, who were going to the
Country of the <HI>Mercious;</HI> be&s;ides whom
there was a Woman who had a little Girl
of Seven or Eight Months Old that was ve|ry
ill. <HI>Imanon</HI> (of whom I have &s;poken)
was now the Chief of our Company; he is
the greate&s;t Phy&s;ician (that is the greate&s;t
Juggler) of the Country: who tho' he is a
great Hypocrite, and very much for plura|lity
of Wives; yet did not &s;cruple to ac|quaint
<PB N="19" REF="160">
us, that this Child was very Sick;
when we had examin'd the matter we jud|ged
it nece&s;&s;ary to Baptize her, which Father
<HI>Bechamel</HI> did, at the time when the&s;e Tra|vellers
parted from us. I had before Bap|tiz'd
a little Girl in the Cottage of this <HI>Ima|non</HI>
immediately after it was born, becau&s;e
the Mother of it when &s;he brought it into
the World had left it in the (13) Dirt, from
whence they would not take it up for a
long time, being told of this di&s;order, and
finding they would put nothing under the
Infant to keep it from the coldne&s;s of the
Mud, and of the Night I baptiz'd it.</P>
<P>The Fourteenth we left this Hutt, and
pre&s;ently enter'd into the River of <HI>Tenapo|ribo,</HI>
which is very deep and rapid, tho' it
winds much; we were not the Fir&s;t <HI>French</HI>-Men
that had been upon this River; and
we have been inform'd that Three <HI>Engli&s;h</HI>-Men
were kill'd and Eaten there (14) &s;ome
Years ago by the <HI>Nouragues:</HI> 'Tis very dif|ficult
to Navigate this River, meerly be|cau&s;e
of its narrowne&s;s, and becau&s;e the
great Trees upon the Banks of it when they
fall, often extend their Branches to the o|ther
&s;ide, &s;o that one mu&s;t either pa&s;s over
or under the&s;e Trees, which is not done
without a great deal of difficulty. We lay
one Night in the Woods, and on the Fif|teenth
Arriv'd at a Hutt where we conti|nued
<PB N="20" REF="161">
to the Eighteenth, which was the
la&s;t Day we were upon this River, and in
the Evening we &s;aw the la&s;t Company of
the <HI>Nouragues</HI> on this River, 80 Leagues
from the Mouth of it: This Company
con&s;i&s;ts of Four Huts, at a little di&s;tance
one from another, wherein there are above
Six&s;core Per&s;ons, of a good natural Di&s;po&s;i|tion,
and very teachable: There was not
one in the Cottage, where we lodg'd, but
was taught by us, to pray to God every
Day; this Cottage was compos'd of &s;eve|ral
Men, &s;ome of whom were &s;ingle Per|&s;ons,
others were married only to one Wife,
with whom they liv'd very well; and there
is great Probability of making good Chri|&s;tians
of 'em. This Cottage is at Two De|grees,
Forty Two Minutes of Northern
Latitude, and together with the Neigh|bouring
ones, and two others at Two
Leagues di&s;tance, might give employ to a
good Mi&s;&s;ionary.</P>
<P>We left this Hut, on the Twenty Se|venth
of <HI>April,</HI> towards Evening, to go
and &s;eek our Guides, who were not far off,
with whom we advanc'd by Land, and
went only Five Leagues among very diffi|cult
Mountains.</P>
<P>The Twenty Ninth we travell'd about
Ten Leagues, in a Way a little more plea|&s;ant,
and lay in the Woods as we had
<PB N="21" REF="161">
done the Night before. Our Three Guides
&s;hew'd us Two Rivulets, which they &s;aid
were <HI>Tenaporibo</HI> and <HI>Camopi,</HI> that were ve|ry
rapid; and Five or Six Leagues beyond,
<HI>Tenaporibo</HI> is Forty Foot broad, and full
Twelve in depth: And at Fifteen Leagues
di&s;tance, or a little more, the River <HI>Camo|pi</HI>
is as big as the <HI>Sein</HI> is below <HI>Paris,</HI> from
whence one may conjecture what Compa&s;s
it takes in its cour&s;e.</P>
<P>The Thirtieth we went to lodge upon
the River <HI>Eiski,</HI> from whence Two of our
<HI>Nouragues,</HI> went to the <HI>Nouragues</HI> of the
River <HI>Inipi,</HI> to borrow a <HI>Canoo,</HI> and &s;o to
come again at us, where we lodg'd; for the
River <HI>Eiski</HI> runs into the <HI>Inipi.</HI> This they
did for our Ea&s;e, our Journey having been
very hard, con&s;idering our Weakne&s;s.</P>
<P>The Fir&s;t of <HI>May</HI> they came to us again,
with a pretty hand&s;ome <HI>Canoo,</HI> wherein
there were Three <HI>Nouragues,</HI> that never had
&s;een a <HI>French</HI> Man, or any other <HI>European,</HI>
in their Lives. Their A&s;pect was very
&s;weet, and they &s;eem'd to be of a very
tractable Di&s;po&s;ition; when they had &s;een
us they returned Home, and we embarked
in this <HI>Canoo,</HI> a little after Noon, and came
to lodge in the Woods, upon the River
<HI>Inipi,</HI> where our Guides (15) mended the
<HI>Canoo;</HI> and the next Day, being the Second
of <HI>May,</HI> having gone down this River,
<PB N="22" REF="162">
which has a very rapid Stream, about Ten
Leagues, we enter'd into the River <HI>Camo|pi,</HI>
in which we we went Four Leagues
more, and that again&s;t the Stream: For <HI>I|nipi</HI>
lo&s;es its Name, and with <HI>Camopi</HI> makes
a great River, which goes and joyns it &s;elf
to the River (16) <HI>Yapoque,</HI> Five Days Voy|age
from thence. <HI>Camopi</HI> is very &s;wift, and
has &s;o many difficult Falls, that 'tis no ea&s;ie
Matter to number them; we went up this
River the Third and Fourth of <HI>May,</HI> with
a great deal of Difficulty and Danger. The
Fourth of <HI>May</HI> we lay upon a flat Rock,
where we found a Piece of a Min'd Cot|tage,
the Covering of which our Men
mended with Boughs: That Day we pa&s;s'd
through a perilous Place, not only becau&s;e
of a dangerous Fall of Water; but like|wi&s;e,
becau&s;e it was commanded by a Cot|tage
of <HI>Nouragues,</HI> which is the La&s;t of that
Nation, the Ma&s;ter of it is a <HI>Morou,</HI> the
Name of an <HI>Indian</HI> Nation, one of whom
was hang'd at <HI>Cayenne,</HI> above a Year ago,
for killing a <HI>French</HI> Man: We had Rea&s;on
to fear, that he would, after the Manner
of the <HI>Indians,</HI> revenge this Man's Death
upon us; but one of our Guides, who
was al&s;o a <HI>Morou,</HI> had married his Daugh|ter,
and we hop'd the Pre&s;ence of this
young Man, whom we then took to be a
<HI>Nourague,</HI> would divert his ill Humour;
<PB N="23" REF="162">
as indeed it happen'd: And after we were
got a&s;hoar upon our flat Rock, which is
in the Country of the <HI>Acoquas,</HI> we were
greatly comforted to &s;ee our Three Guides
ask for their Supper by the Sign of the
Cro&s;s, where no Per&s;on had ever done it
before; and that, without having any need
to be put in mind of it. But that which
&s;till increas'd our Joy, was, that the young|e&s;t
of our Guides, who might be about
Seventeen Years of Age, after Supper, of
his own accord, &s;ang in the Tune of the
Church, <HI>Sancta Maria, Ora pro nobis;</HI> ha|ving
been yet taught no more than that. I
continued the Litanies, and he an&s;wer'd
me. Towards Evening our principal Guide
gave a Signal, with a &s;ort of a Pipe, that
may be heard at a great Di&s;tance. The next
Day, being the Fifth of <HI>May,</HI> we had a
very rainy Morning, which hinder'd us
from going forward; but notwith&s;tanding
the Rain about Nine a Clock in the Morn|ing,
we &s;aw three young <HI>Acoquas,</HI> who were
&s;ent to know who we were, we went with
them towards Noon, and about Three a
Clock arriv'd &s;oon after them, at the fir&s;t
Hut of the <HI>Acoquas;</HI> which is at Two De|grees,
and Twenty Five Minutes of Nor|thern
Latitude. They were mightily pleas'd
to &s;ee us; for in all appearance, they had
&s;ome con&s;iderable time before heard of our
<PB N="24" REF="163">
Voyage. They &s;o familiarly acquainted
them&s;elves with us, that in Three Days
time, there was not one of them that refus'd
to pray to God; and we every Day put 'em
upon &s;aying their Prayers Morning and
Evening. The Second Day our fir&s;t Guide
brought us to two other Cottages not far
off; where we were entertain'd with as
much Kindne&s;s, as Strangers could de&s;ire of
a Savage People: Immediately, tho&s;e that
liv'd about a Day's Journey more remote
receiv'd the News of our Arrival, and came
to &s;ee us. They all admir'd our Hats, our
Ca&s;&s;ocks, our Shooes, a Gun; which we
made our fir&s;t Guide di&s;charge from time
to time, in great Companies of 'em; the
Pictures of our <HI>Breviaries,</HI> our Writing,
and the Songs of the Church, which they
de&s;ir'd to hear a great many times in a Day.
They heard our In&s;tructions with Attenti|on;
and &s;eem'd to have very good Senti|ments,
and to be much affected, when we
told 'em, that formerly the People of our
Country were ignorant of God, and that
&s;ome good People came into our Nation,
who taught us, that there was a God, who
would make us happy for ever in Heaven;
and what we were to do, that we might
go to that ble&s;&s;ed Place: That we were
come to do them the &s;ame good Office, that
they might go to Heaven as well as we.
<PB N="25" REF="163">
That which gives me good Hopes of the
Conver&s;ion of this Nation, is, that they
heard tho&s;e Commands of God with Re|verence,
which are mo&s;t oppo&s;ite to their
ancient Manner of living. And this gives
me occa&s;ion to &s;peak more di&s;tinctly of
what I have remark'd in the&s;e Two Nati|ons.</P>
<P>The <HI>Nouragues</HI> and the <HI>Acoquas,</HI> in Mat|ter
of Religion, are the &s;ame with the <HI>Ga|libis.</HI>
They acknowledge there is a God,
but don't wor&s;hip him. They &s;ay he dwells
in Heaven, without knowing whether he
is a Spirit or no, but rather &s;eem to believe
he has a Body. The <HI>Galibis</HI> call God
(17) <HI>Tamoucicabo;</HI> that is as much as to &s;ay,
the Ancient of Heaven. The <HI>Nouragues</HI> and
the <HI>Acoquas</HI> call him <HI>Maire,</HI> and never talk
of him but in fabulous Stories: They have
a great many Super&s;titions, which are on|ly
like the idle Tales and Fooleries of Chil|dren,
in which I never ob&s;erv'd 'em practi&s;e
any Idolatry: But I am very much afraid
their Phy&s;icians, by their juggling Tricks,
debauch the Women and Maids; for they
have given me great Rea&s;on to think &s;o.</P>
<P>The natural Di&s;po&s;ition of the <HI>Nouragues</HI>
and <HI>Acoquas</HI> is mild; but the more remote
from the Sea the <HI>Nouragues</HI> live, the more
tractable you'll find 'em; for the frequent
Concour&s;e they have with the <HI>Indians,</HI> on
<PB N="26" REF="164">
the Sea-Coa&s;ts, renders 'em more uncontrou|lable
and difficult to be treated with. 'Tis
certain, the <HI>Acoquas</HI> are quite another &s;ort
of People, than the <HI>French</HI> at <HI>Cayenne</HI> ima|gine
'em to be, who account 'em fierce,
cruel, treacherous and perfidious, to tho&s;e
they entertain, For if one may judge of
that Nation, by near Two Hundred of 'em,
whom we have &s;een, they are an hone&s;t,
affable, plea&s;ant People, and are very at|tentive
and ready to receive what is &s;aid to
'em. Tis true, they not long &s;ince exter|minated
a &s;mall Nation, and eat &s;everal of
them; but I attribute this Barbarity to the
ill Cu&s;tom of the Country, rather than to
the Di&s;po&s;ition of the People; and this
&s;eems the more probable, becau&s;e being in|form'd
Two or Three Days after our arri|val,
that there was half a Day's Journey
from us, &s;ome of the Fle&s;h of a <HI>Magapa</HI>
(the Name of a People that are their Ene|mies)
whom they had newly kill'd with
another, while they were watching their
opportunity to &s;urprize one or other of the
<HI>Acoquas</HI> alone; and be&s;ides, one of the Peo|ple
of the Cottage having &s;et before us the
Jaw of a young Man; we told 'em, <HI>This
was not well done, and that God forbids us
to kill an Enemy, when we take him Pri&s;oner,
and to eat him afterwards:</HI> At this they
look'd down very much without giving
<PB N="27" REF="164">
one Word of a Reply. Another time, the
Ma&s;ter of one of the Cottages having heard,
that the <HI>Galibis</HI> to hinder us from underta|king
this Voyage, had threaten'd us, that
we &s;hould be roa&s;ted by the <HI>Acoquas,</HI> was
fill'd with great Indignation at it, and
could not be pacified till I told him, I took
tho&s;e <HI>Galibis</HI> for Lyars and Fools: Having
moreover, told 'em, I had been made Pri|&s;oner
of War by the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> and re&s;tor'd
to the <HI>French,</HI> without receiving any harm;
and that God would not allow us to kill
tho&s;e we took in War; they &s;eem'd pretty
well to approve of this Law. And tho'
this barbarous Cu&s;tom is a Point &s;o much
e&s;tabli&s;h'd and receiv'd in all Times among
the <HI>Acoquas,</HI> and among the <HI>Nouragues</HI> too;
yet it &s;eems, by what I have been relating,
to be no difficult Matter to re&s;train 'em
from this Savage Practice, of killing and
eating their Enemies.</P>
<P><HI>Polygamy</HI> is a Second Ob&s;tacle which we
found again&s;t the Chri&s;tian Religion a|mong
the&s;e Two Nations of the <HI>Nouragues,</HI>
and <HI>Acoquas;</HI> for where there's one Man
to be found, that has but one Wife, there
are &s;ix, who have each of 'em two or
three. The Hope that may be conceiv'd
for the eradicating of this Vice, is, not
concerning Per&s;ons that are already pre-in|gag'd
in this evil Cu&s;tom, but only tho&s;e

<P>The Way of Living among the People
of the&s;e Two Nations, is very agreeable,
and has &s;omething more courteous in it,
than that of the <HI>Galibis.</HI> For In&s;tance, A|mong
the <HI>Galibis,</HI> tho&s;e that are married,
dine every one apart, and tho&s;e that are
unmarried eat all together; and all the
Women, Maids and little Children, go to
another &s;ide of the Hut to eat. The <HI>Nou|ragues</HI>
and <HI>Acoquas</HI> do quite otherwi&s;e, for
the Husband eats with his Wife, or Wives
and Children with admirable Agreement
and Union. They don't drink (19) much,
but are great eaters; and are always Fi&s;hing
or Hunting, in which they &s;pare no Pains,
to get their Living. They are all Lyars,
as well as all other <HI>Indians,</HI> that we know.
And when they perceive their Lyes are di&s;|cover'd,
they retire, &s;eeming to be a little
a&s;ham'd, but will not fail to frame a Lye
again on the next Occa&s;ion. The <HI>Nouragues</HI>
endeavour'd to fright us with a great many
Stories of their own Invention, to make us
alter our Re&s;olution of going to the <HI>Aco|quas,</HI>
that we might &s;pend all our Stock of
Goods with them; &s;ometimes telling us,
<PB N="29" REF="165">
they had &s;een the Track of &s;ome &s;trange
wild Bea&s;t; &s;ometimes that the <HI>Caranes,</HI>
their Enemies, were running up and down
their Woods, and that they had ob&s;erv'd
the Steps of Three of that Nation not far
from their Hut: But when they &s;aw they
could not terrifie us, they did what we
would have 'em. This Vice induces 'em
to promi&s;e much, and to perform but little;
which al&s;o is occa&s;ion'd by the little Judg|ment
they have, to e&s;teem any thing ac|cording
to the Value and Importance of
it; for this makes 'em not matter what In|jury
they do any one, in breaking their
Word; nor how much they di&s;honour
them&s;elves in &s;o doing. To have a thorough
Conception, how common this is in the&s;e
Two Nations (which is al&s;o rife among all
the <HI>Indian</HI> Nations we are acquainted with)
one mu&s;t compare 'em to little Children,

They are al&s;o &s;ubject to Steal; &s;o that &s;ome

or four times &s;tronger than that of the
<HI>Nouragues;</HI> for having ask'd an old Wo|man,
how many Cottages there were on
one &s;ide, to which we pointed; &s;he told
us, there were Ten; then pointing toward
the Quarter, where their Chief dwelt, &s;he
took a (20) Handful of her Hair, to &s;ignifie
to us, the great Number of Cottages there
were on that &s;ide. Between the <HI>Acoquas,</HI>

the Nation of the <HI>Pirios,</HI> which the <HI>Acoquas</HI>
&s;ay, are equal to them&s;elves in Strength:
On the Ea&s;t and South-Ea&s;t-&s;ide are the

<P>After we had been with the <HI>Acoquas</HI>
Twelve or Thirteen Days, the Air grew

which &s;eldom fails to blow in tho&s;e Coun|tries;
and indeed, 'tis that that renders 'em
habitable. Father <HI>Bechamel</HI> was taken with
a Tertian Ague, and the &s;tronge&s;t of our
Servants al&s;o fell very &s;ick: We therefore
pre&s;s'd our Guides to return, &s;ince they
were not willing to conduct us any farther,
nor &s;uffer the <HI>Acoquas</HI> to go and fetch their
Chief, who dwelt at the Di&s;tance of Three
Days Journey, from the Place where we
were, with whom we would have con|tracted
an Alliance. The&s;e Three Guides
became in&s;olent, upon the Suppo&s;ition, that
it was to honour them that the <HI>Acoquas</HI>
came in &s;uch great Numbers; tho' in all
appearance, it was the Curio&s;ity of &s;eeing
us <HI>French</HI> Men that brought 'em together:
They became very trouble&s;ome, e&s;pecially
<PB N="32" REF="167">
the <HI>Morou,</HI> who gave &s;ufficient Indications
of his wicked Di&s;po&s;ition, per&s;wading the
<HI>Acoquas,</HI> that we ought to leave them
all our Wares; the&s;e &s;o unrea&s;onable Pro|po&s;als
did not much &s;urprize us; but to give
'em good Hopes of our Return, we left an
(22) Iron Tool of Half a Crown Price with
one of 'em, who had but one Wife, upon
Condition, that I &s;hould have a great
(23) Hamock when I came again; promi|&s;ing
I would then give him a Bill and a
Knife, to make up what this wanted of the
Value of it. I made choice of this Man
on purpo&s;e to &s;ignifie what re&s;pect I had
for lawful Marriages; and he under&s;tood
me very well, and promis'd me, he would
not take a Second Wife, during the Life
of this he already had, with whom he had
liv'd at lea&s;t Eight or Nine Years, for
they had a Daughter about Seven Years
old; however, this Project facilitated our
Return.</P>
<P>The <HI>25th</HI> of <HI>May</HI> we embark'd on the

was in the lea&s;t of 'em, with our
principal <HI>Nourague,</HI> and an <HI>Acoquas,</HI> who
had a Mind to go with us to <HI>Cayenne;</HI> and
I went in the other with our Two Servants,
the <HI>Morou,</HI> and the young <HI>Nourague,</HI> who
not taking care to guide the Ve&s;&s;el right,
let it run &s;o near the Precipice of a great
<PB N="33" REF="167">
Fall of Water, that tho&s;e in the other <HI>Canoo,</HI>
cry'd out, believing we &s;hould be lo&s;t: But
the&s;e Two young Men, with much ado,
brought our <HI>Canoo</HI> under a Rock, that brake
the Violence of the Stream, and getting up
the Rock, with all their Might, drew the
<HI>Canoo</HI> out of this Danger. 'Tis abundant|ly
more dangerous to go down the&s;e Falls,
than to get up 'em; becau&s;e they cho&s;e
tho&s;e places where the Water runs le&s;s vio|lently
to get the <HI>Canoo</HI> up with main
Strength, whereas in going down 'em they
take the &s;wifte&s;t Part of the Stream, &s;o that
one runs a greater Hazard of one's Life,
than can ea&s;ily be expre&s;s'd.</P>
<P>After having pa&s;s'd the&s;e Dangers, the
Second Day after we embark'd, our young
<HI>Nourague,</HI> that had never run the like Ri&s;que
before, &s;aid in his own Language, <HI>God is
good, and is not angry with us.</HI> When we
came to the Place, where we were to go
by Land, betwixt the River <HI>Inipi</HI> and <HI>Te|naporibo,</HI>
our Guides, who were well load|ed
with Hamocks, and other things, which
they had bought of the <HI>Acoquas,</HI> were not
willing to help us, which yet they would
have done, if that <HI>Morou</HI> had not put 'em
out of Humour: They walk'd very fa&s;t, as
the <HI>Indians</HI> are wont to do, when they
are loaded, and at la&s;t left us at Five
Leagues di&s;tance from <HI>Tenaporibo;</HI> but
<PB N="34" REF="168">
by the Goodne&s;s of God we got thro'
without lo&s;ing our Way, by following a
Path, in which the&s;e <HI>Indians</HI> had thrown
little Boughs, in &s;everal places where it
was not ea&s;ie to di&s;cern the Track; to &s;ig|nifie
which Way they went. When we
came within Three quarters of a League of
the fir&s;t Cottages, we heard &s;ome <HI>Nouragues</HI>
calling to us, who brought us <HI>Ca&s;&s;ave</HI> and
<HI>Fi&s;h</HI> to eat, and &s;ome <HI>Ovicou</HI> to drink.</P>
<P>The Fir&s;t Day of <HI>June</HI> our young <HI>Morou,</HI>
being drunk, treated us very ill, which
made us re&s;olve to return to <HI>Cayenne</HI> in ano|ther
<HI>Canoo,</HI> and in the Company of other
<HI>Indians,</HI> and the rather becau&s;e our Di|&s;tempers
increas'd upon us. I had a vio|lent
Fever, and a great Cough, and Father
<HI>Bechamel</HI> was very ill, as well as the lu&s;ti|e&s;t
of our Servants. And now as we had
need of the &s;pecial A&s;&s;i&s;tance of Provi|dence,
to find a Conveniency for our Re|turn;
&s;o it pleas'd God to manife&s;t to us,
how particular a Care he took of our Pre|&s;ervation,
in furni&s;hing us with what we
needed; not indeed, at the Time we wi&s;h'd,
nor after that Manner we thought be&s;t, but
in &s;uch a Sea&s;on, and in &s;uch a Way, as
was mo&s;t convenient for us, 'till at length
we arriv'd at <HI>Cayenne.</HI></P>
<P>The Second Day of <HI>June</HI> we made an A|greement
with the fir&s;t <HI>Nourague,</HI> who had
<PB N="35" REF="168">
done us &s;ome Service at <HI>Caraotibo,</HI> Three
Leagues from <HI>Aproague,</HI> who was of a very
good Temper, and was come thither with
two other <HI>Nouragues</HI> of the &s;ame Place,
who had a Kindne&s;s for us, and were wil|ling
to return Home as &s;oon as they could.
We determin'd to &s;et forward the next
Day, to prevent our <HI>Morou,</HI> and our other
Guides, who were el&s;ewhere, from oppo&s;ing
our De&s;ign. We were to go three Leagues by
Land, or Seven by Water, to get to this
Man's <HI>Canoo;</HI> but I was &s;o ill, I could not
go by Land, and our Servant was asbad as I,
&s;o that we were forc'd to &s;eek a <HI>Canoo,</HI> to go
by Water, the Providence God provided
us a little One, which we hired, that was
&s;unk in the Water, but was big enough to
carry Four of us; namely, the <HI>Indian</HI> and
his Wife, our Servant and my &s;elf. Father
<HI>Bechamel,</HI> tho' very weak, had the Courage
to undertake the Journey on Foot, with
our other Servant. We were de&s;irous to have
gone forward the next Day, from the Place
where this <HI>Nourague</HI>'s <HI>Canoo</HI> lay; but we
&s;hould not have been able to have under|gone
this Fatigue: It pleas'd God to pro|vide
for our Welfare, on this occa&s;ion, in
permitting the <HI>Indians</HI> to detain us Eleven
Days in this Place, where there were near
Sixty Per&s;ons: The Chief of whom, who
had a Son in the Neighbourhood of <HI>Cayenne,</HI>
<PB N="36" REF="169">
plac'd us in a Cottage by our &s;elves, that
we might not be di&s;turb'd, with the Noi&s;e
of a great Merry-meeting they were going
to have, and order'd his Wife to treat us
the be&s;t &s;he could: This was partly from
his good Humour, and partly to &s;ecure
his Son from receiving any ill Treatment
from the <HI>French</HI> at <HI>Cayenne.</HI> God was pleas'd,
during our &s;tay here, to give us an Oppor|tunity
again, to in&s;truct a Woman that was
almo&s;t eaten up with Cancers; &s;o that &s;he
was at length baptiz'd by Father <HI>Bechamel,</HI>
the Day before we left this Place: This Fa|ther
was &s;o weak, that he could not repeat
his Breviary walking; and yet the next
Day, he was &s;trong enough to walk near
a League from thence to embark. There
now remain'd but one Difficulty to encoun|ter
with, &s;ince we were in the Hands of
Three very hone&s;t <HI>Nouragues;</HI> and that was,
how to get away from <HI>Camiati</HI>'s Cottage,
with our little Che&s;t that contain'd all our
Goods; and to find a convenient Pa&s;&s;age
to the Mouth of the <HI>Aproague;</HI> for I had
promis'd <HI>Camiati,</HI> to continue with him af|ter
my return from the <HI>Acoquas;</HI> and tho&s;e
People are not very ea&s;ie, when they &s;ee
us carry our Commodities out of their Cot|tages;
&s;o that we had Rea&s;on to fear, that
he would detain us with him, at lea&s;t Two
Months, before he would conduct us to
<PB N="37" REF="169">
the <HI>Indians,</HI> that dwell at the mouth of the
<HI>Aproague:</HI> But it pleas'd God to remove all
the&s;e Ob&s;tructions; for our Three <HI>Noura|gues</HI>
promis'd to convey us to the Sea, upon
condition that we would give 'em an indif|ferent
Reward. And as we went by <HI>Cami|ati</HI>'s
Cottage, we found he was gone a Hunt|ing,
and tho&s;e we found in his Cottage
were only his Two Wives, and &s;ome Stran|gers,
who dur&s;t not hinder us from taking
our little Che&s;t, and our Three Guides,
tho' they were affraid to di&s;plea&s;e <HI>Camiati</HI>
their Chief, yet knew not how to refu&s;e to
lead us to a Cottage that was a League low|er,
where at that time no body dwelt, and
hither they were to go in order to pa&s;s by
Land to <HI>Caraotibo</HI> where they dwelt, and to
conduct their Wives thither, and then to
come back again to us; tho' they would
fain have &s;et us a&s;hore at <HI>Camiati</HI>'s Hou&s;e, and
left us there.</P>
<P>When we Arriv'd at the empty Cottage, I
found my &s;elf &s;o ill, that I thought I &s;hould
have died; but being &s;omewhat recruited a|gain,
and perceiving the Ma&s;ter of the <HI>Ca|noo</HI>
had a mind to go and &s;peak with <HI>Cami|ati,</HI>
and that one of our Servants de&s;ir'd to
go with him, to fetch a Hound he had
bought that was run away thither. I gave him
an Iron-tool of half a Crown price to pre|&s;ent
from me to <HI>Camiati,</HI> that he might or|der
<PB N="38" REF="170">
his Wives to prepare me a Hamock, and
bid him tell him I would pay the re&s;t at my
return, which &s;hould be as &s;oon as I had
recover'd my Health: this I did to prevent
his offering any injury to our Servant, and
that he might not oppo&s;e us in our de&s;ign
of going back. The Ma&s;ter of the <HI>Canoo</HI>
told the Story of the Affront the Young
<HI>Morou</HI> gave us, and of the ill Condition of
my Health, &s;o well to <HI>Camiati;</HI> that when
he had receiv'd the Pre&s;ent I &s;ent him, he
would needs accompany me to the Mouth
of the <HI>Aproague,</HI> to the Cottage of the Chief
of the <HI>Sapayes,</HI> whom he had had a mind to
Vi&s;it a great while, being his very good
Friend. He came accordingly the next day
with one of his Sons, who was about Thir|thy
Years of Age, and his Two Wives, and
&s;ent home Two of our Guides, taking their
places, he &s;ent the Woman, and one of our
Servants one League by Land. Our other
Servant continued in the <HI>Canoo</HI> to row, or
to u&s;e the Term of the Country to <HI>Pagay,</HI>
with the&s;e Three &s;tout <HI>Nouragues;</HI> we al&s;o
remain'd in the <HI>Canoo,</HI> by rea&s;on of our
Weakne&s;s, which would not &s;uffer us to go
this League by Land. They lighted the <HI>Ca|noo</HI>
thus, that they might the better pa&s;s a
fall of the River, that was &s;o rough and
difficult, that the <HI>Indians</HI> could not choo&s;e
but turn pale at the extreme danger we
<PB N="39" REF="170">
were in. One time among&s;t others they
toil'd &s;o hard to keep the <HI>Canoo</HI> from being
carry'd down a precipice of Water, that
when they had made &s;hift to get under a
Rock, that breaks the Violence of the Stream,
they were forc'd to re&s;t them&s;elves for half
a quarter of an Hour, becau&s;e they were &s;o
much &s;pent, that they could &s;carce fetch
their Breath. I have twice been very near
being ca&s;t away in two Ships, but the &s;ight
of this fall of the River was more dreadful
to me, than any thing I ever &s;aw at Sea.</P>
<P>The Nineteenth of <HI>June</HI> we pa&s;s'd down
Two of the&s;e Falls, at the fir&s;t they &s;ent the
Women away by Land, and cro&s;s'd the Ri|ver
to know of a <HI>Galibi</HI> that was lately come
thither to make a new Cottage, what cour&s;e
they had be&s;t take to avoid being over-&s;et,
becau&s;e the Bed of the River declin'd, &s;o that
it gave an extraordinary rapidity to the
Stream; and be&s;ides there were a great many
Rocks under water, again&s;t which we were
liable to be da&s;h'd, and &s;o ca&s;t away. And
ob&s;erving our Men were in a great perplex|ity
in their minds about it, notwith&s;tand|ing
all the directions this Man gave 'em,
we intreated him to conduct us through
this difficult pa&s;&s;age, promi&s;ing him a
Fi&s;hing-hook for his pains, which he wil|lingly
undertook, and happily perform'd.
At the Second which was the la&s;t we met
<PB N="40" REF="171">
with upon the <HI>Aproague,</HI> we all went a&s;hore
and walk'd along the River-&s;ide upon ve|ry
uneven Rocks, and the <HI>Nouragues</HI> held
the <HI>Canoo</HI> by a Line which they tied behind
it, and &s;o let it go gently down this place,
which is very dangerous at Low-water, for
the Flowing of the Tide covers it, tho'
'tis Twenty Leagues up the River.</P>
<P>After we had pa&s;s'd the&s;e many difficul|ties
by the mercy of God; we at la&s;t had no
Ca&s;&s;ave left, no Meat nor Fi&s;h, nor <HI>Ovicou,</HI>
when we were di&s;tant a days Voyage and
a half from the Cottage of the <HI>Sapayes,</HI> but
God of his Goodne&s;s was pleas'd to make
Provi&s;ion for our great nece&s;&s;ity; for as
we coa&s;ted along the River we &s;aw a Dog
barking; upon which the <HI>Nouragues</HI> call'd
out to know if any body were a Hunting,
and pre&s;ently to their great joy perceiv'd it
was their good Friend, the Chief of the
<HI>Sapayes,</HI> who came to us, and &s;aluted us all
with demon&s;trations of Friend&s;hip. We
did what the <HI>Nouragues</HI> would not venture
to do, that is, to ask him to &s;ell us &s;ome
Provi&s;ion; acquainting him, that neither
we nor the <HI>Nouragues</HI> had any left. When
he under&s;tood in what nece&s;&s;ity we were,
he &s;ent to fetch his <HI>Canoo,</HI> which was a
large one, and very well &s;tor'd with <HI>Ca&s;&s;ave,
Ovicou,</HI> Meat and Fi&s;h (24) <HI>Boucaneed;</HI>
which he furni&s;h'd us and the <HI>Nouragues,</HI>
<PB N="41" REF="171">
and we paid him for it immediately. He
told us his Lodging was a League off,
whither he would come and meet us in the
Evening, and that becau&s;e his little half-cover'd
Hut had only room enough for
him and his Men, we mu&s;t make another
for our &s;elves. He came according to his
word toward Night, and the next day he
made Father <HI>Bechamel</HI> and me go into his
<HI>Canoo,</HI> becau&s;e he thought the <HI>Nouragues
Canoo</HI> was over-loaded.</P>
<P>On the 21&s;t we Arriv'd at the Cottage of
this Chief of the <HI>Sapayes,</HI> where we were
kindly entertain'd. We were no &s;ooner got
thither, but we began to think how we
&s;hould get from thence to <HI>Cayenne;</HI> and we
could think of no better way, than to per|&s;wade
the Chief of the <HI>Sapayes</HI> to conduct
us thither him&s;elf, which would have ta|ken
up Three Weeks time, and would have
been a great charge to us, but the Provi|dence
of God had made Provi&s;ion for us,
for the next day we were inform'd that a
Chief of the <HI>Galibis</HI> would come the day
following to take a <HI>Sapaye</HI> with him to go
to <HI>Cayenne,</HI> and from thence to <HI>Maroui,</HI>
from whence he was to fetch his Son, who
had been there with the <HI>Sapayes</HI> for Two
Years, as well as the Son of the Chief of
the <HI>Sapayes.</HI> He was willing to take us in
his <HI>Canoo</HI> for a &s;mall matter, and we went to
<PB N="42" REF="172">
Lodge at a &s;mall I&s;land, which is in the
River at a pretty good di&s;tance from the
Sea; here we &s;tay'd the Twenty fourth of
<HI>June.</HI> I ob&s;erv'd that the Sea came up here
Eight Foot high, and concluded from
thence, becau&s;e it covers the la&s;t Fall of the
River, that it declines but Eight Foot in
the &s;pace of Twenty five Leagues from the
Sea. In the Night they heard the Cry of a
Bird, and &s;aid to one another in the <HI>Galibis</HI>
Tongue, <HI>Hark how the Devil cries;</HI> I re|prov'd
'em, telling 'em they were mi&s;taken,
and that the Devil had no Body, but was
a Spirit as our Souls are, which they con|fe&s;s
to be Invi&s;ible and Immortal, which
yet they do not &s;ay of the Devils, but pre|tend
that their Phy&s;icians or <HI>Piaies</HI> kill 'em
with great Clubs. <HI>The Nouragues</HI> of one
Cottage made the Figure of a Man in the
the way by which they thought the Devil
came to their Cottage in the Night, to
make 'em Sick; that &s;o while he &s;top'd at
this Fantome and took it to be a <HI>Nourague,</HI>
the <HI>Piaies</HI> that watch'd for him might take
their opportunity, when they &s;aw him, to
knock him on the head. We parted from
this I&s;land to go and lodge at <HI>Co,</HI> from
whence the next day we &s;aw a great many
<HI>Canoos</HI> of the <HI>Galibis</HI> at Sea, which were go|ing
toward the River of <HI>Amazons,</HI> the&s;e
the Ma&s;ter of our <HI>Canoo,</HI> and the <HI>Sapaye</HI>
<PB N="43" REF="172">
went to vi&s;it, drawing their <HI>Canoos</HI> along
over the Mud at Low-water, and found in
one of 'em the Two Young Men they were
going to &s;eek for at <HI>Maroui.</HI> They had
now nothing to do but to carry us to <HI>Ca|yenne;</HI>
and becau&s;e the Sea was &s;o rough,
that they could not well bear up again&s;t it,
we de&s;ir'd 'em to &s;et us a&s;hore at <HI>Mahuti,</HI>
the fir&s;t place we could land at in the I&s;land
of <HI>Cayenne,</HI> which they compa&s;s'd with a
great deal of Labour. As &s;oon as I &s;et my
Foot upon the Sand, I fell down upon my
Knees to thank God for the Protection he
had favour'd us with for a Hundred and
Seventy Leagues, &s;ince we came from the
Country of the <HI>Acoquas,</HI> for our whole
Voyage was Two hundred and forty
Leagues. We went to lodge at the Hou&s;e of
Mon&s;. <HI>Fontain,</HI> who&s;e E&s;tate lies in this part
of the I&s;land; and he receiv'd us with
great Joy. The next day being the Twen|ty
&s;eventh, Father <HI>Bechet</HI> came to fetch us
with Two Hor&s;es, and we borrow'd ano|ther
of (25) Mon&s;ieur <HI>Fontaine,</HI> and &s;o
Arriv'd at the Fort of <HI>Cayenne,</HI> where the
Governor was pleas'd to treat us with all
imaginable Friend&s;hip. And all the Peo|ple
came about us, to &s;ee us, and to &s;ignifie
the geat affection they had to us. In three
Months I hope by the Grace of God to Vi|&s;it
the Mar&s;hes of the <HI>Aracarets,</HI> the <HI>Pali|cours,</HI>
<PB N="44" REF="173">
the <HI>Mayes,</HI> the <HI>Marones,</HI> and the
<HI>Cou&s;&s;ades,</HI> who&s;e Habitations &s;tand more
thick and clo&s;e one to another, than tho&s;e
I have given an account of in this Relation.
Here's a great Field open'd to the Go&s;pel-Labourers,
into which I am ready to conduct
tho&s;e that are willing to employ them&s;elves
in it, as well as to di&s;cover to 'em a great
many other Nations: Being fully re&s;olv'd
by the Grace of God to expo&s;e my Life for

<P>A Fort which the <HI>Dutch</HI> took from the

which is pretty Numerous, and was E&s;ta|bli&s;h'd
there Eight or Ten Years before un|der
the Command of the Lord <HI>Willoughby.</HI>
This Fort was built by the <HI>French</HI> in 1644,

that have been reported in divers Relations.</P>

<P><HI>Note (7) Ibid.</HI> In the&s;e Huts or Cottages
the <HI>Indians</HI> hang their Hamocks or Cotton-beds
when the Sun &s;ets, in which they re|po&s;e
them&s;elves all Night. They ordinarily
ri&s;e with the Sun, and then their Wives take
down their Beds and Hamocks, and hang 'em
in the <HI>Carbet,</HI> which is their kind of Hall or
Out-hou&s;e, the Props of which not only
&s;erve to &s;upport the Roof, which is made of
Palm-leaves, but al&s;o to hang up all the Beds
of the Men and Boys in the Family, and
tho&s;e of Strangers, when at any time they
entertain 'em. This <HI>Carbet</HI> is plac'd Ten or
Twelve paces on the upper-&s;ide of the Cot|tage,
in which the Women always leave
their own Beds. At one end of the Cottage
<PB N="47" REF="174">
they commonly make <HI>Ca&s;&s;ave,</HI> and their Li|quor
<HI>Ovicou;</HI> this part of it &s;erves for the
Kitchin, and for all the Work that belongs to
the &s;ub&s;i&s;tance of the Family. Some of the&s;e
Cottages have a Loft above to hang their
Beds in in the Night; and then the lower-part
of the Hut &s;erves for the <HI>Carbet;</HI> where
the Men &s;pend the day (when they are at
home) in making their Bows and Arrows,
and what other conveniencies they want;
for their bu&s;ine&s;s is different from that of
the Women in the&s;e Parts, as well as in mo&s;t
other Places. But there's one thing belonging
to the other Sex which the Men have u&s;urp'd,
that de&s;erves to be treated on in a particular
Article, of which I &s;hall only &s;peak a word
or two here by the by. They go to bed, when
their Wives are deliver'd, and receive the
Compliments of their happy delivery as if
they had endur'd the pain, and accordingly
an&s;wer their Vi&s;itors as the Women do on
the like occa&s;ion in other places. This Cu|&s;tom
is not peculiar to the <HI>Galibis,</HI> but is
us'd in a great many other Nations of <HI>Bra&s;il,</HI>
and in other parts of <HI>America.</HI></P>
<P>'Tis farther to be noted, that their <HI>Carbets</HI>
are the places where they hold their Con&s;ul|tations,
and deliberate on their mo&s;t weighty
Affairs, which is ordinarily done with great
Solemnity; tho&s;e that are concern'd and in|vited,
a&s;&s;embling together from divers pla|ces
for this purpo&s;e.</P>

<HI>Note (8) Ibid.</HI> This Nation dwells near
the mouth of the River of <HI>Amazons.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Note (9) P.</HI> 7. This is the ordinary Bread of
the Country, made of a &s;ort of Root, which
they &s;crape, and then pre&s;s to get the Water
out of it, which is a cold Poi&s;on, and will
kill Men, or Bea&s;ts if they drink but half a
gla&s;s of it; which for all that may be put in
Sauces and Pottage, and gives 'em a better
reli&s;h, provided it be but boyl'd tho' never &s;o
little, afterwhich it has no pernicious quality.</P>
<P><HI>Note (10) P. 11. Piaie</HI> is a Name which
the <HI>Galibis</HI> give their Phy&s;icians, who be&s;ides
the practi&s;e of Phy&s;ick pretend al&s;o to Divi|nation;
but they profe&s;s neither, till they
have made divers Experiments, one of which
is &s;o dangerous that it often makes 'em bur&s;t.
They &s;tamp the green Leaves of <HI>Tobacco,</HI> and
&s;queeze out the Juice of it, of which they
drink the quantity of a large Gla&s;s full; &s;o
that none but tho&s;e that are of a very ro|bu&s;t
Con&s;titution, who try this practi&s;e up|on
them&s;elves, e&s;cape with their Lives. Be|&s;ides
divers &s;orts of Plants, Gumms, and
Wood they u&s;e to cure di&s;ea&s;es and wounds,
they have a way of &s;ucking their Patients in
that part of the Body in which they feel
their pain; and this method is mo&s;t com|monly
very &s;ucce&s;sful.</P>
<P><HI>Note (11) P.</HI> 15. The rea&s;on why they
employ &s;o much time in making their <HI>Canoos</HI>
<PB N="49" REF="175">
is becau&s;e after they have cho&s;en and fell'd a
Tree, and have with a Hatchet made it hol|low,
about the breadth of half a Foot, and
about the &s;ame depth through the whole
length of it, they hollow the re&s;t of it with
a gentle Fire; and this work, which goes on
very &s;lowly; continues in proportion to the
bulk of the piece of Timber, and to the
length they give their <HI>Canoo.</HI> This way of
making their <HI>Canoos</HI> is very tedious, but tends
much to their duration, &s;o that they &s;carce
ever rot, becau&s;e after they are thus made, the
Worm never touches 'em, which is al&s;o part|ly
owing to the hardne&s;s of the Wood;
there being &s;carce any betwixt the Tropicks
but has this quality.</P>

<P><HI>Note (14) Ibid.</HI> In the Year 1625, the <HI>En|gli&s;h</HI>
attempted to make a Settlement at <HI>Cayen|ne,</HI>
&amp; the&s;e Three who were devour'd by the
<HI>Indians</HI> were probably &s;ome of 'em, for their
E&s;tabli&s;hment did not &s;ucceed, they being
defeated by the <HI>Indians,</HI> for not managing
them&s;elves well towards 'em. Their Princi|pal
Plantation was at <HI>Cayenne,</HI> upon the Ri|ver
<HI>Remire.</HI> The &s;ame di&s;appointment be|fel

<P><PB N="50" REF="176">
<HI>Note (15) P.</HI> 21. The Poop of great <HI>Canoos</HI>
being commonly joyn'd to the re&s;t, they
caulk it with a &s;ort of fat Earth, which the
Water in a little time wa&s;hes away, and
therefore they are oblig'd to put it in a fre&s;h
from time to time; and this they call mend|ing
or refitting a <HI>Canoo.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Note (16) P.</HI> 22. The mouth of this River

came from <HI>Barbadoes,</HI> with 4 or 5 Fri|gats,
to make a de&s;cent upon <HI>Cayenne</HI> in the
Year 1666, Father <HI>Grillet</HI> was Superior of
the <HI>Je&s;uits</HI> there, and was &s;ome time among&s;t
the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> who left him there with the re&s;t
of the Colony when they went away.</P>
<P><HI>Note (19) P.</HI> 28. 'Tis true, they drink
but little or nothing at their ordinary meals
till they have done eating, and then com|monly
<PB N="51" REF="176">
drink one draught; but when they
a&s;&s;emble together, either for Warlike Enter|prizes,
or to begin a <HI>Canoo,</HI> or to launch it
when 'tis made, and when they make a
Chief, or admit him into their Council, af|ter
they have expos'd him to &s;everal rude
kind of Trials; they have extraordinary Re|joycings,
which frequently hold 3 or 4 days,
continuing till they have drank up all their
Liquor; which is what the <HI>French</HI> call <HI>Faire
un Vin.</HI> For the&s;e occa&s;ions they make 3 or 4
different &s;orts of Drink, &s;ome of which be|come
very &s;trong by fermentation, as that
which they call <HI>Palinot,</HI> which they make
with <HI>Ca&s;&s;ave</HI> that is bak'd more than ordina|ry:
The pieces of which they pile up one
upon another when they are very hot, and
keep 'em thus till they begin to be mouldy,
after which they mix them with <HI>Potatoes,</HI>
which they cut in &s;mall pieces as well as the
<HI>Ca&s;&s;ave,</HI> and put them in great Earthen Jarrs,
then they pour a proportionate quantity of
Water upon 'em, and &s;o leave all to fer|ment
and work together till this Liquor is
as &s;trong as they de&s;ire; which is after about
5 or 6 days fermentation. They &s;train it
before they u&s;e it, and then 'tis of the Co|lour
and Con&s;i&s;tence of Beer, of a much bet|ter
ta&s;t, but much more heady and intoxi|cating.
They have be&s;ides a great many
&s;orts of drink, the diver&s;ity of which Re&s;ults
<PB N="52" REF="177">
from the different Fruits of which they make
'em. But that which they ordinarily make u&s;e
of, is as white as Milk, and of the &s;ame con|&s;i&s;tence.
It is very refre&s;hing and nouri&s;h|ing,
and is compos'd of <HI>Ca&s;&s;ave</HI> bak'd after
their ordinary manner, and <HI>Potatoes</HI> boil'd
with it, till they are of the con&s;i&s;tence of
Pa&s;te, this they put into Baskets lin'd with
the Leaves of <HI>Bonano</HI>-trees, in which it keeps
good for a Month, and then begins to grow
&s;ower, but not quite &s;o &s;oon if it be kept in
a cool place. When they u&s;e it they &s;teep
as much as they have pre&s;ent occa&s;ion for in
a &s;ufficient quantity of Water, and if they
are at lei&s;ure they &s;train it: But they often
only &s;teep it, and drink it without &s;training,
and if Sugar or Sugar-cains bruis'd be mix'd
with it, it comes very near the ta&s;t, and co|lour,
and con&s;i&s;tence of <HI>Orgeate,</HI> the u&s;e of
which the <HI>French</HI> have taken from the <HI>Ita|lians</HI>
&s;ome Years &s;ince. This drink is call'd
<HI>Ovacou</HI> upon the Continent; and <HI>Ovicou</HI> in
the I&s;lands. 'Tis believ'd that the rea&s;on
why the <HI>Europeans</HI> can never attain to make
it &s;o good as the <HI>Indians</HI> do, is becau&s;e the&s;e
chew the <HI>Potatoes</HI> and <HI>Ca&s;&s;ave,</HI> before they
boil 'em together, and under&s;tand better
what degree of boyling they require, to give
this Liquor its greate&s;t perfection. But the
&s;eeing this way of its preparation turns ones
&s;tomach more than the reading of it; and
<PB N="53" REF="177">
the Wine that wa&s;hes the dirty Feet of the
Grape-gatherers as they tread the Grapes is
no le&s;s nau&s;eous, but the Fermentation
both of the one and the other corrects all
this uncleanline&s;s.</P>
<P><HI>Note (20) P.</HI> 30. This is their common way

<P><HI>Note (23) Ibid.</HI> A Hamock is an <HI>Indian</HI>
Bed, made of Cotton; tho' they all hang
'em up by the two ends, when they would
lie in 'em, &s;ometimes upon 2 Trees, at 10
or 12 Foot di&s;tance, and &s;ometimes at two
of the Po&s;ts that &s;upport their Hou&s;es, or
their Carbets; yet they differ very much
both in the Stuff and Work. For In&s;tance,
All the Hamocks that are made from the
River of <HI>Amazons</HI> to the <HI>Orenoque,</HI> are of
Cotton, made full, and almo&s;t all without
Fringe on the &s;ides; mo&s;t of 'em colour'd
with <HI>Rocou,</HI> or red Paint, quarter'd in Flou|ri&s;hes
that are made with pretty good Pro|portion
and exactne&s;s; the&s;e are mo&s;t e&s;teem'd
for U&s;e, e&s;pecially in the I&s;lands, becau&s;e
they la&s;t a great while; and are &s;tronger
than tho&s;e of <HI>Brazil,</HI> which are &s;o thin, one
may generally &s;ee through 'em, and are made
of twin'd Cotton, much finer than tho&s;e of
<HI>Guiana,</HI> which are al&s;o made of twi&s;ted
<PB N="55" REF="178">
Cotton-thread, but cour&s;er. Tho&s;e of <HI>Brazil</HI>
have all a great Fringe on each &s;ide, and have
for the mo&s;t part very much work about 'em,
the <HI>Brazilian</HI> Women are &s;o ingenious, that
there is &s;carce two of their Cotton Beds in
a hundred, which are brought from the &s;ame
place, that are made ju&s;t alike: The <HI>Galibis</HI>
paint mo&s;t of 'em Red, after they are made,
and while they are yet upon the Loom. The
<HI>Brazilian</HI> Women make &s;carce any but white
Hamocks; and if they mix either Red, or
Blue, or Green, with the White, or all of
'em together (as they do frequently) they
work 'em with Thread ready dyed, and &s;o
the Men don't touch 'em; whereas in <HI>Gui|ana</HI>
the&s;e Beds are painted only by the Men,
the Women leaving this Work to them,
when they have fini&s;hed the Web: They
weave 'em after the following Manner, as
well in <HI>Brezil</HI> as in <HI>Guiana.</HI> All their Imple|ments
are two round Sticks, about 8 or 9
Foot long, and 3 or 4 Inches Diameter;
the two Ends of one of the&s;e round Sticks
lie a-cro&s;s upon two Pieces of Wood, about
8 or 9 Foot from the Ground, more or le&s;s,
according to the Length the Work-woman
is order'd, or de&s;igns her &s;elf to make her
Bed. The other round Stick hangs direct|ly
under this, and 'tis to the&s;e two round
Sticks that the Warp of the Hamock is fa|&s;ten'd,
after which they have a kind of
<PB N="56" REF="179">
Shuttle, which they put through the
Threads, to weave it after the Manner of
our Gloth: But becau&s;e they put their Shuttle
through Thread by Thread, one above and
the other below; this Work is extreamly
tedious, and has need of no le&s;s Patience
than theirs.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e of <HI>Brazil</HI> having much more work
about 'em, require the more Time and In|du&s;try
to make 'em; but one &s;ort and ano|ther
are very much bought in the I&s;lands,
where almo&s;t all the <HI>Europeans</HI> make u&s;e of
'em; and they are very good to u&s;e in <HI>Eu|rope,</HI>
e&s;pecially in tho&s;e Places, where they
have but bad and uncleanly Beds, particular|ly
<HI>Spain</HI> and <HI>Italy,</HI> whither one might carry
'em without much trouble, they being very
light; for the bigge&s;t of 'em don't weigh
above 5 or 6 Pound, and tho&s;e of <HI>Brazil</HI> not
above half &s;o much, becau&s;e they are thin
and fine; with 2 Pegs, or 2 great Nails
they may be hang'd up any where. The <HI>In|dians</HI>
place the Props of their Hou&s;es at a
convenient di&s;tance one from another, for
this Purpo&s;e: They don't go out far into
the Country without the&s;e Beds; and there
are always enough left in their Hou&s;es for
Strangers.</P>

<HEAD>A
RELATION
OF
G&V;IANA,
AND OF THE
COMMERCE
THAT
May be Settled there.</HEAD>
<P><HI>G&V;iana</HI> is a great Country, on the Con|tinent
of Northern <HI>America,</HI> which
extends in Latitude, from the Equi|noctial
Line, to the Tenth Degree, on the
&s;ide of the Arctique Pole, and in Longi|tude
from the River of <HI>Amazons</HI> to the <HI>O|renoque,</HI>
which contains near Four Hun|dred
Leagues on the Sea-Coa&s;ts, with an
immen&s;e Stretch into the Countries that
border upon <HI>Brazil,</HI> on the South-&s;ide, and
<HI>New Audalou&s;ia</HI> on the We&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="60" REF="181">
Our <HI>French</HI> Seamen are wont to call <HI>Gui|ana</HI>
by the Name, of the <HI>North-Cape,</HI> be|cau&s;e
that is the mo&s;t remarkable Cape on
that Coa&s;t; and tho&s;e that have Bu&s;ine&s;s in
tho&s;e Parts, commonly put a&s;hoar there, to
get &s;ome Knowledge of the Country.</P>
<P>This Cape is between the 2 and 3 De|grees
of Northern Latitude, and between
the 345 and the 346 Degrees of Longitude.
This Part of the Continent is water'd with
abundance of Rivers, &s;ome of which will
carry great Ve&s;&s;els up a con&s;iderable Way
beyond the Mouths of 'em; and upon the
Shoars of 'em; an infinite Number of Plan|tations
might be made, which would turn
to a very con&s;iderable Account, as well in
regard of the Traffick that might be made
with the Natives, and the Fi&s;hing-Trade
that might be carried on in the&s;e Rivers,
and along the Sea-Coa&s;t, as of the Pro|duct
of the Labour and Indu&s;try of the
Planters.</P>
<P>The divers Settlements the <HI>French</HI> have
made there at different Times, &s;ufficiently
prove the Po&s;&s;ibility of living in good Cor|re&s;pondence
with the <HI>Indians,</HI> provided
they be treated civilly; and with more
Hone&s;ty and Sincerity than
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Mon&s;ieur <HI>de la Barre</HI> had not yet made a Settlement there, when this Account was writ|ten.</NOTE> they have done, who have
hitherto had the Conduct of
the&s;e kind of Enterprizes,
<PB N="61" REF="181">
fall into their Hands. The ill Treatment
the Natives have receiv'd from them, for
which they have &s;ometimes made them|&s;elves
amends by way of Reprizal, have not
render'd 'em irreconcileable, as we have been
taught by Experience, when we have made
tryal of it on different Occa&s;ions.</P>
<P>They are tolerably endued with good
Sen&s;e, which they have opportunity to cul|tivate
and refine by a long Train of Expe|riences,
with which the many Years they
live, furni&s;h 'em: For they count a Man
dies young, if he don't live above 100 Years.</P>
<P>They have a pretty good Judgment, and
have good rational Thoughts, about things
within the Compa&s;s of their Notice, and
within the Reach of the Light of Nature,
with which alone they are furni&s;h'd.</P>
<P>They ob&s;erve their Words with great Ex|actne&s;s,
and inviolably practi&s;e the Maxim,
of not doing to others, what they would
not have others do to them.</P>
<P>They are rather inclin'd to Peace than
War, which yet they engage in, either when
they have &s;ome ju&s;t Quarrel, or when Re|venge
or Honour prompt 'em to it.</P>
<P>They are &s;ufficiently indu&s;trious, and al|though
they have both Patience and Skill
in Fi&s;hing and Hunting, yet they have the
Fore-&s;ight, not to let their Sub&s;i&s;tance de|pend
upon Hazard; and therefore willing|ly
<PB N="62" REF="182">
cultivate their Ground, in proportion
to their Occa&s;ions, and the Bigne&s;s of their
Families.</P>
<P>Before <HI>Europe</HI> had furni&s;h'd them with
Tools of Iron and Steel for this Purpo&s;e,
they made them&s;elves &s;ome of hard Stones;
but be&s;ides that the Labour of making 'em
was intolerable, the Pains they took in
u&s;ing of 'em, was al&s;o &s;o very great, that
they laid a&s;ide the u&s;e of 'em, as &s;oon as they
found they could do more Work in a Day
with our Hatchets, Bills and Knives, than
they could do in 6 Months with their Stone
Tools; which now are good for nothing,
but to be kept in the Clo&s;ets of the Curious,
as &s;o many Proofs of the wonderful Pati|ence
of tho&s;e People.</P>
<P>They &s;peak a Tongue, which is not only
under&s;tood by all the Nations, which the
<HI>Spaniards</HI> on one &s;ide, and the <HI>Portuge&s;e</HI> on
the other, have oblig'd to retire into <HI>Gui|ana;</HI>
but is al&s;o intelligible to the <HI>Carraibes,</HI>
who are the Natives of the <HI>Antilles,</HI> and
u&s;e this Language: Which I have known
by the <HI>Indians</HI> of the I&s;les of St. <HI>Vincent,</HI>
St. <HI>Domingo,</HI> and others where I had occa|&s;ion
to conver&s;e with them. In &s;hort, this
Language is &s;poken for the Space of above
Four Hundred Leagues on the Sea-Coa&s;ts,
and in many Places above Six&s;core Leagues
up in the Country.</P>
<P><PB N="63" REF="182">
They bring up all &s;orts of tame Fowl,
which they exchange with us for Toys, as
well as wild Fowl, and other Game, which
is there in great Plenty; as al&s;o abundance,
both of Sea, and Fre&s;h-water Fi&s;h.</P>
<P>They build us Hou&s;es after their Fa&s;hion,
which are commodious enough for the
Country; they clear our Ground and car|ry
our Letters, they &s;erve to load and un|load
Merchant Ships; and in a Word,
there's &s;carce any kind of Service but may
be obtain'd of 'em by a courteous Carriage,
and by giving 'em a few Trifles of a &s;mall
Value, when they have occa&s;ion for 'em.
They undertake even to load Ships entire|ly
with a kind of Fi&s;h, which they catch
in the Rivers with a &s;ort of Harping-Iron;
and this they perform upon &s;uch rea&s;on|ble
Terms, that tho&s;e who follow this
Trade by their Means, always find an ex|traordinary
Profit in it; becau&s;e the Vent
of 'em is always &s;peedy and certain in the
I&s;lands, where there is a great Con&s;umption
of 'em made; &s;o that one may &s;ay, this &s;ort
of Fi&s;h, and the Sea-Tortoi&s;e, are the Cod-fi&s;h
of the Continent, and the <HI>Antego</HI> I&s;lands.</P>
<P>And 'tis the <HI>Manna,</HI> upon which the
Colonies between the <HI>Tropiques</HI> live, as much
as many of the <HI>Europeans,</HI> and &s;ome others,
do upon Cod-fi&s;h. This Fi&s;hing Trade
is practis'd all the Year in mo&s;t of the Ri|vers
<PB N="64" REF="183">
on this Coa&s;t, except the Fi&s;hing for
Tortoi&s;e, which holds but 3 or 4 Months in
the Year; during which, the Females come
to lay their Eggs in the Sand, beyond the
Marks that are left of the highe&s;t Tides, and
that in &s;o great abundance, (e&s;pecially on
the Shoars that are lea&s;t frequented) as can
hardly be imagin'd: For 10 Men can turn
as many of 'em in a Night, as 100 can dre&s;s
in a Week.</P>
<P>In the Night, which is the only time
they take to lay their Eggs, they wait 'till
they have pa&s;s'd the Bounds, which the
highe&s;t Tides have mark'd, and then turn
'em upon their Backs, and being once in this
Po&s;ture, they can by no means recover them|&s;elves
upon their Feet to go back into the Sea.</P>
<P>Among the Plants which the <HI>Indians</HI> cul|tivate
in their Plantations, Cotton is one of
tho&s;e that principally employs 'em, e&s;peci|ally
the Women who make this their
particular bu&s;ine&s;s; and thus find means to
adorn them&s;elves; for they know how to
&s;pin it as fine as can be de&s;ir'd. And if the
di&s;orders that have happen'd in the Colo|nies
upon the Continent, had not hinder'd
the E&s;tabli&s;hing a Regular Traffick of it,
which might have been ea&s;ily accompli&s;h'd;
I &s;ay, if it had not been for this, all <HI>Europe</HI>
might have been furni&s;h'd with it, in all
manner of ways in which it could have been
<PB N="65" REF="183">
imploy'd, without co&s;ting the <HI>French</HI> any
more trouble or charge in a manner, than
that of receiving it; becau&s;e of the natural
and general inclination the <HI>Indians</HI> have
both for Work, and for Finery; e&s;teeming
a grain of Chri&s;tal to hang about their Neck
or at their Ears, as much as we &s;hould do a
Diamond of the &s;ame bigne&s;s.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, it being well known, that Cot|ton
is one of tho&s;e Commodities that are
con&s;um'd the mo&s;t in <HI>Europe,</HI> and the Price
of which is lea&s;t varied, the Inhabitants of
the I&s;lands would never have left off culti|vating
it, if there had been Women enough
to &s;pin it, without which it can't be Tran&s;|ported
but with a great deal of Trouble,
and little Profit.</P>
<P>The Hamocks or Cotton-beds which the
<HI>Indians</HI> &s;ell us for a Bill or Hatchet, are after|wards
&s;old in the I&s;lands with con&s;iderable
Advantage; every one there having one of
'em, and there are none of them brought from
any other Country than <HI>Guiana,</HI> except from
<HI>Bra&s;il,</HI> and that but rarely, becau&s;e of the
&s;mall Commerce the <HI>French</HI> have there.</P>
<P>Their <HI>Rocou</HI> is a red Die, and valuable
when 'tis natural, &s;uch as the <HI>Indians</HI> &s;ell
us, before it has been fal&s;ified by For|reigners,
who carry it into <HI>Europe.</HI> See
<HI>&V;rucu in Catal. Plant. Jamaic.</HI> P. 150.</P>
<P><PB N="66" REF="184">
There are to be had among 'em likewi&s;e
divers &s;orts of Gumms, Woods, and Roots
proper for Phy&s;ick, which are good Com|modities
in <HI>France,</HI> as well as &s;everal &s;orts
of Wood proper for Dying; and for ma|king
of Cabinets and Inlaid Works, among
which is the Letter-wood, which the <HI>French</HI>
call <HI>Bois de la Chine,</HI> and which grows in no
other place in the World but on this part of
the Continent. The Natives cut it and car|ry
it in great burthens quite to the Ships &s;o
cheap, that a 1000 weight of it comes to
but a Crown; whereas that quantity was a
long time &s;old for a 100 Crowns, and ne|ver
for le&s;s than 150 <HI>Livres.</HI></P>
<P>Be&s;ides tho&s;e Animals that are fit for
&s;port; as <HI>Apes</HI> of divers kinds, <HI>Sapajous, Ta|marins,
Sagovius, Parrots, Arras</HI> and <HI>Tocaus:</HI>
I omit a great many other things, which
this Country produces; and one may &s;ay,
this large Compa&s;s of Ground has more|over
this Advantage above the I&s;lands of
<HI>America,</HI> that there is no fear of tiring it;
as we are taught by Experience, the I&s;land
of St. <HI>Chri&s;topher,</HI> and others have been in
a little Space of Time, where the Land is
become almo&s;t barren, meerly by being o|ver-burden'd
with continual Crops, becau&s;e
it can never be &s;uffer'd to re&s;t, by Rea&s;on
of the &s;mall Portion of Ground that every
Inhabitant po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es; which yet does not
<PB N="67" REF="184">
hinder 'em from rai&s;ing every Year a prodi|gious
Quantity of Sugar, be&s;ides Ginger,
Indigo, Ca&s;&s;ia, and other Commodities that
are cultivated and made there.</P>
<P>This Country of <HI>Guiana</HI> is diver&s;ified
with Hills, Plains and Meadows; and there
are &s;carce any Mountains but would turn
to a good Account, if they were manur'd:
The Land is every where &s;o fertile, that one
Man may ea&s;ily get, with his own Hands,
a Livelihood for Twenty People, the Cul|tivation
of it is &s;o very ea&s;ie. The Fruits
of it are excellent, and very plentiful; and
all our &s;orts of <HI>Corn</HI> grow there all the
Year round, without di&s;tinction of Sea|&s;ons,
and that in a very little time: And
there being no Winter, the Trees are alter|nately
cover'd with Blo&s;&s;oms and Fruits,
and always with Leaves.</P>
<P>The Air is very good, and the Climate
very Temperate, tho' it be between the
<HI>Tropiques;</HI> for the Heat is continually mi|tigated
by a fre&s;h Ea&s;t-wind, which blows
all the Year, except in the Night, when
the <HI>Breezes</HI> come from the Land, which
are only felt one or two Leagues toward
the Sea.</P>
<P>The Waters are excellent, and keep good
throughout the longe&s;t Voyages, as has
been often experienc'd in <HI>Europe,</HI> where
they are never found to &s;tink at the Re|turn
<PB N="68" REF="185">
of the Ships, that have taken in their
Provi&s;ion of 'em in this Country. It mu&s;t
not be omitted, that there are on this Coa&s;t
a great many I&s;lands &s;o proper for the Feed|ing
of Cattle, that provided &s;ome nece&s;&s;ary
Precautions be ob&s;erv'd, there is no doubt
but there would in a &s;hort time be as great
a Number of 'em produc'd (if a Stock were
carried thither) in proportion, as in the
other I&s;lands, whither Ships go every Day
for Hides; as they do to St. <HI>Domingo,</HI> and
el&s;ewhere.</P>
