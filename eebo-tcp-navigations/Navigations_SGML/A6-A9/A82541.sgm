<HEAD>A Narrative of the late Engagement betwen the Engli&s;h Fleet under the Command of General <HI>Blake,</HI> and the Holland Fleet under the Command of Lieutenant Ad|miral <HI>Trump</HI> near <HI>Dover.</HI></HEAD>
<P>UPon Tue&s;day the Eighteenth of <HI>May</HI> 1652. in the morning, General <HI>Blake</HI> being gone to the We&s;t|ward as far as <HI>Rye</HI> Bay eight days before with twelve or thirteen Ships, leaving Major <HI>Bourn</HI> in the <HI>Downs</HI> with eight Ships onely, there appeared upon the back&s;ide of the <HI>Goodwin</HI> a <HI>Holland</HI> Fleet of Men of War con&s;i&s;ting of two and forty Ships, one whereof had a Flag on the main-top-Ma&s;t head, the re&s;t Jacks and Ancients; and being come unto the South-&s;ands head, two of them bore up towards the Engli&s;h Ships in the <HI>Downs,</HI> where|upon Major <HI>Bourn</HI> &s;ent out the <HI>Greyhound</HI> to examine them, and to know the rea&s;on of their &s;o near approach; who an&s;wering, That they had a Me&s;&s;age to the Com|mander in chief in the <HI>Downs,</HI> were permitted to come in, and having &s;aluted the Flag, the two Captains na|med <HI>Ty&s;on</HI> and <HI>Aldred</HI> came Aboard the &s;aid Major <HI>Bourn,</HI> and acquainted him that they were &s;ent by <HI>Van Trump</HI> to let him know that he had been Riding about <HI>Dunkirk</HI> with his Fleet, where by rea&s;on of foul Wea|ther they had lo&s;t many of their Cables and An|chors, and the wind being Northerly, were driven fur|ther to the Southward then they intended, which <HI>Van Trump</HI> thought fit to &s;ignifie to prevent any mi&s;appre|hen&s;ions or Jealou&s;ies. And having &s;aid this, and re|ceived for an&s;wer, That the Reality of what they &s;aid would be&s;t appear by their &s;peedy drawing off from this Coa&s;t, they departed to their Fleet; and immediately upon their arrival with them, the whole Fleet &s;tood up
<PB N="6" REF="4">to <HI>Dover,</HI> and came to an Anchor within little more then &s;hot of the Ca&s;tle the &s;ame day in the afternoon. Upon their coming before <HI>Dover</HI> Ca&s;tle, and Riding there with Flag in the Main-top, without &s;aluting the Ca&s;tle, the Ca&s;tle made three &s;hot at them; notwith|&s;tanding which, the Dutch Admiral kept up his Flag, and rode there at Anchor until the next day noon, and exerci&s;ed his Mu&s;quetiers, by di&s;charging Volleys of &s;mall &s;hot many hours together. Upon Wedne&s;day about twelve a clock the Dutch Fleet weighed Anchor and &s;tood off towards <HI>Calice</HI> &s;ome four Leagues into the South-ea&s;t; about the &s;ame time the Engli&s;h Fleet un|der General <HI>Blake</HI> coming from the We&s;t towards the <HI>Downs</HI> di&s;covered them, and &s;uppo&s;ed by their cour&s;e they had been going back; Major <HI>Bourn</HI> likewi&s;e was in &s;ight, coming from the <HI>Downs</HI> to joyn with General <HI>Blake.</HI> About an hour or two after, the Holland Fleet altered their cour&s;e, came back again, made all the Sail they could, and bore directly with General <HI>Blake, Van Trump</HI> the headmo&s;t with his Flag in the Main-top; and being come within &s;hot, the General &s;hot a Gun at his Main-top, and then two &s;ingle &s;hot more: whereupon <HI>Trump</HI> &s;hot a &s;ingle &s;hot through the Generals Flag, and then immediately gave the fir&s;t Broad-&s;ide and took in his Pendants, and hung out his Red Flag under the Holland Colours, which was the Signal on their part for their whole Fleet to ingage, and &s;o the Fight began, which happened between four and five a clock in the af|ternoon, and continued until nine of the clock. In the Fight the Engli&s;h took two of the Holland Fleet, one whereof having &s;ix foot water in the Hold they left, ta|king the Captain and Officers aboard, the other being a Ship of thirty Guns. General <HI>Blake</HI> lay all night
<PB N="7" REF="4">where the Fight began, or near thereabouts, and the Holland Fleet was e&s;pyed about four Leagues di&s;tant towards the Coa&s;t of <HI>France</HI> next morning.</P>
<P>The truth of this Relation appears in the Letters of General <HI>Blake,</HI> Major <HI>Bourn,</HI> and others in the Action, by the Examinations of the Dutch Captains, and other Officers taken in the Fight; the In&s;tructions given to the Dutch Captains and Commanders, and other Pa|pers, all which are hereunto annexed.</P>
<P>And whereas <HI>Van Trump</HI> in the accompt he gives of this Action, makes the occa&s;ion of his coming back upon the Engli&s;h Fleet, the guarding of &s;ome Mer|chant men richly laden from the <HI>Streights,</HI> which had been in fight with &s;ome of our Friggots: That action is &s;et down in a Letter written by Captain <HI>Yong</HI> (here|unto al&s;o annexed) whereby the occa&s;ion, beginning and ending thereof is declared: And be&s;ides, the&s;e very Ships which he pretends to come to protect or re|&s;cue, upon Saturday before had pa&s;t by General <HI>Blake,</HI> and were gone to the Ea&s;tward.</P>

<P>UPon the Eighteenth of <HI>May,</HI> the Wind being at North-Ea&s;t, the weather &s;omething hai&s;ie, about
<PB N="16" REF="9">Ten in the morning we &s;aw a great Fleet on the back &s;ide of the <HI>Goodwyn &s;and,</HI> which lay with their &s;ayls hayl'd up, and drove to the fouthward the later Tyde of Ebb in land; about twelve they were &s;o nigh, that we plainly de&s;cried them to be all Men of War, con&s;i&s;t|ing of One and forty in number, one whereof had a Flag at the main Top-ma&s;t head, the re&s;t Jacks and An|cients, <HI>Hollands</HI> Colours, at which time they were near the <HI>South &s;ands</HI> Head: There was in the <HI>Downs</HI> the <HI>Andrew, Triumph, Fairfax, Entrance, Centurion, Adventure, A&s;&s;urance, Greyhound,</HI> and the <HI>Seven Bre|thers,</HI> all the re&s;t of the Fleet being with the General to the We&s;tward, by who&s;e &s;pecial Command I wore a Flag at the main Top-ma&s;t head; the appearance of which I humbly conceive was one cau&s;e among&s;t others which moved their General to &s;end two Frigots to|wards me, which as &s;oon as I perceived plying into the Road, I &s;ent out the <HI>Greyhound</HI> to examine them, and know the ground of their Approach; who returned this An&s;wer to the Captain, That they had a Me&s;&s;age from their Admiral to the Commander in the <HI>Downs,</HI> at which he made &s;ayl towards me, permitted them to come in, the two Frigots came near and &s;aluted the Flag, and then the Captains came on Board, who&s;e names were, one <HI>Ty&s;on,</HI> and the other <HI>Aldred,</HI> who brought this Me&s;&s;age from their Admiral <HI>Van Trump,</HI> That by rea&s;on of much Northerly Winds, he with his Fleet was put the &s;outhward farther then he intended, and having Anchored the day before off <HI>Dunkirk,</HI> ma|ny of his &s;hips had lo&s;t Anchors and Cables, and &s;o were forced to leewards; but withal declared, that they had &s;pecial Command from their Admiral to &s;ignifie thus much, That it was the onely cau&s;e of their coming
<PB N="17" REF="9">to prevent any thoughts or mi&s;aprehen&s;ions, for that he had not the lea&s;t purpo&s;e to offer injury to any of the Engli&s;h Nation, but for fear lea&s;t any noi&s;e or Alarum &s;hould be given either at Land or Sea, he thought good to &s;end this me&s;&s;age. And further, the one of them in di&s;|cour&s;e &s;aid, that their Admiral <HI>Trump</HI> would have come him&s;elf into the Road, but that he was not willing to breed any difference about his Flag, fora&s;much as he had not order to take it down: To whom I replied, That I pre&s;umed there would be no new thing required of them, and neither more nor le&s;&s;e would be expected from them, but what they knew to be the ancient Right of this Nation; and withal I de&s;ired them to return this An&s;wer from me to their General, That their Me&s;&s;age was civil, that our General was to the We&s;t-ward, whom I looked for hourly, and that received; and if what they delivered was &s;o intended, I de&s;ired the Re|ality there of might be manife&s;ted by their &s;peedy draw|ing off from this place with their Fleet, for el&s;e this their appearance would be otherwi&s;e expounded; and &s;o I di&s;mi&s;&s;ed them, who made &s;ail to their Admiral who lay off the South-Sands head. I expected them to come into the Road every moment, and therefore was in readine&s;s with the &s;mall &s;trength I had under my charge; &s;o &s;oon as the two Friggots before mentioned came back to their General, they all made Sail and &s;tood toward <HI>Dover,</HI> and there they came to an Anchor that Tyde. At the fir&s;t appearance of them, after I had made them certainly to be the <HI>Holland</HI> Fleet, I did according to my duty give &s;uch an Accompt thereof to the Right Honorable the Councel of State, as the time and other bu&s;ine&s;s would admit, &amp; withal I immediate|ly
<PB N="18" REF="10">di&s;patched a Ketch to our General, who met with the advi&s;e thereof that night about <HI>Ne&s;&s;e.</HI> All the next night we lay in readine&s;s, our Anchors apeck, and kept two Friggots one at a di&s;tance from the other be|twixt us and them, giving them In&s;tructions to make a Signal to me either night or day, that I might under|&s;tand their motion whether towards, the General or el&s;e|where, to the end I might the better be able to order my &s;elf and the party with me to the be&s;t advantage for &s;ecurity of the Generals Fleet and our &s;elves. In the morning about ten a clock I received advice from the General being a little to the We&s;t-ward of <HI>Foul&s;tone,</HI> and according to Order received from him, calculated the time and Tyde, &s;o that we might mo&s;t opportunely make conjunction of our Forces. About twelve a clock I &s;et &s;ail out of the <HI>Downs,</HI> the wind being Ea&s;terly, im|mediately after I perceived the <HI>Hollanders</HI> to be under &s;ail &s;ome of them, and the re&s;t making ready: we &s;teer|ed along&s;t, and when we came as high as the South|foreland, the <HI>Hollanders</HI> Fleet was got off the Shore and were <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 word"> Channel over plying to wind-ward towards <HI>Ca|lice,</HI> at which time I &s;aw our General and tho&s;e with him, and within an hour after or thereabouts, the <HI>Hol|land</HI> Fleet bore up and made Sail toward him; we ha&s;t|ned towards him, and hope I may &s;ay, &s;ea&s;onably came in, for by that time the Guns were fired betwixt the Admirals, we were with the body of their Fleet and in|gaged with them from half an hour pa&s;t four in the afternoon till it was dark; what execution we did upon them they be&s;t know, I &s;hall not determine it, but &s;urely they were &s;en&s;ible of us, for they did their utmo&s;t to decline us and avoid our coming near, which we en|deavored
<PB N="19" REF="10">by all means; but their Admiral leading the Van, they all made &s;ail after him, and &s;o &s;hot them|&s;elves to Leeward of us, and &s;o left the Rear of the Fleet to us, which we endeavored to &s;ever from the re&s;t, and accordingly did in part break the Body, and &s;ome of us who were the neare&s;t and had the Advan|tage of the Wind, fell upon the Stern mo&s;t, who I &s;uppo&s;e found it hot work; the one of them of thirty Guns we took which fought &s;toutly, another of the &s;ame force &s;o lamed, her main Ma&s;t &s;hot down, and having much water in Hold yielded, and the Captain thereof came in to our Boat to &s;ave him&s;elf; the night coming on and no hope left him, I pre&s;ume &s;he &s;unk in the night. We not knowing what might be the i&s;&s;ue of this beginning, endeavored to finde out our Gene|ral, to the end we might receive In&s;tructions how to order our &s;elves in the morning, expecting certainly to pro&s;ecute the bu&s;ine&s;s then, for which end we pre&s;ently came to an Anchor, becau&s;e we would be near them in the morning, but they did not &s;top, &s;o that in the morn|ing we could &s;carce di&s;cern them at Top-ma&s;t head; by which we concluded that they were bound over to the coa&s;t of <HI>France,</HI> and were not willing to try it farther at this time, and therefore that evening plyed it up to|ward <HI>Foul&s;tone,</HI> and between that and <HI>Dover</HI> anchored again, and the next day came into the <HI>Downs.</HI></P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>Mo&s;t Honorable Lords,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WE are here by rea&s;on of and unhappy an unex|pected Mi&s;chance; An horrible Report hath amazed us, That a Fight at Sea &s;hould have been be|twixt the Fleet of this Commonwealth and of the United Provinces, and That ours &s;hould have been the rea&s;on of this unfortunate bu&s;ine&s;s, That we began the Fight, and that thereupon is fought mo&s;t cruelly; and that from thence the Rumor of the breaking of the Treaty, and of open War (which &s;hould be very near at hand between the two Nations) was &s;pread: We a&s;toni&s;hed by this &s;ad Report, direct our &s;elves to this Honorable A&s;&s;embly, and do Declare before God, and out of all our Hearts, That the Fact, &s;o as it is re|ported, is committed without the knowledge, and again&s;t the will of the States of the United Provinces
<PB N="27" REF="14">our Lords, and of us their Amba&s;&s;adors. Moreover we do affirm, That the Hearts of ours do de&s;ire nothing but Unity, Peace, League, and a very near Friend&s;hip with this Commonwealth, and hope that with all their wi&s;hes. In the mean while, we do think it not to be ami&s;s, if we give notice unto your Honors, That we have received Letters from the Admiral of the Fleet of the United Provinces, Dated the Thirtieth of the la&s;t Moneth, wherein the occa&s;ion and rea&s;on of the &s;aid Fight-quite otherwi&s;e is declared then the common Re|port is: For the truth of which bu&s;ine&s;s, we &s;uppo&s;e to be convenient to inquire exactly; But this is worth ob&s;ervation in the mean time, That our Admiral <HI>Trump</HI> in the &s;ame Letter doth declare plainly to have no other Order from the Lords the States, then to &s;ail about, and to view the &s;hore and coa&s;ts of our country, as far as <HI>O&s;tend</HI> and <HI>Newport</HI> and no farther. By which it doth appear as clearly as the Sun is under Heaven, That by all means the States of the United Provinces have had no minde to attempt any thing again&s;t the Fleet or other &s;hips of this Commonwealth. If any thing then in this bu&s;ine&s;s be done otherwi&s;e then it ought to be, this doth not concern the &s;aid States, but them which have executed the &s;aid bu&s;ines, and let them make it good. We have been here now almo&s;t &s;ix Moneths about the concluding of a League, by &s;pecial Order of the &s;aid States, and have delivered &s;ome days ago to your Commi&s;&s;ioners a Paper, in which not onely the different Points touching the Treaty, but al&s;o the means by which the &s;ame could be brought to a good Agree|ment, and reconciled one with another, were &s;ufficient|ly declared; &s;o that vve did expect nothing every day,
<PB N="28" REF="15">but a happy end to &s;o good a Work; and truly that ex|cellent matter may in very few hours be fini&s;hed. But who &s;hould ever believe that &s;o Noble a Work, and de|&s;ired vvith &s;o many vvi&s;hes of all hone&s;t men, and e&s;pe|cially of all the Churches of the Reformed Chri|&s;tian Religion, &s;hould be cut off or hindred by any &s;uch imprudent and turbulent man (who&s;oever he may be) without knowledge and again&s;t the will of the Lords the States? By Law of Nature and Cu|&s;toms of all Nations is very well known, That he to whom a Charge is given in particular things, an Am|ba&s;&s;ador in Publique Bu&s;ine&s;s going beyond the limit of their Commi&s;&s;ions, a General of an Army Depopu|lating without order of his Superiors any Grounds of the Neighbors; a wilde bea&s;t doing any mifchief after it hath broken its bond, that not the Ma&s;ters but tho&s;e that have done the wrong are obliged, e&s;pecially if the di&s;approving of the &s;ame Ma&s;ters followeth thereupon; which without que&s;tion (if the bu&s;ine&s;s be &s;o as it is re|lated) is to be expected from the States of the United Provinces. In the mean while we make no doubt, that to attempt any Ho&s;tility before the other party is heard, cannot be approved neither by God, nor by any men, e&s;pecially Chri&s;tians. It is a Cu&s;tom by all rea|&s;onable Nations to demand re&s;titution of their Goods if any trouble be done, and in ca&s;e Satisfaction be given or offered, to lay a&s;ide all Ho&s;tility. And it is no wonder that all Nations are &s;o much again&s;t War and inclined to e&s;tabli&s;h a Peace, the War being plainly a cruel mon|&s;ter, a world of evil, and a meer deluge of innocent blood; therefore the mo&s;t holy Fathers of our Religi|on have expre&s;ly declared the War (although ju&s;t) to be
<PB N="29" REF="15">execrable, e&s;pecially in relation to the Chri&s;tians, who are taught by their meeke&s;t Savior to &s;pare other mens blood as well as their own. But among&s;t all kinde of Wars, is this to be reputed the mo&s;t dete&s;table and hor|rible if between the&s;e Nations War be ri&s;en. Truly the experience teacheth us, that the be&s;t and &s;tronge&s;t Wine (if it be corrupted) becomes the &s;owre&s;t Vineger; and indeed if two Nations having been friends of old times, of the &s;ame Religion, lovers of Liberty, joyning upon the &s;ame Sea, next Neighbors, both Valiant and Warlike be cla&s;hed together, what is to be expected but the Ruine of both, and as the Proverb &s;aith, a Cad|mean Victory. And what el&s;e is this then to afflict and depre&s;&s;e your Friends and Companions in Religion to plea&s;e our Enemies, and to give occa&s;ion openly for to hurt them both. An Author, being none of the lea&s;t among&s;t yours, hath very well compared, as we con|ceive, both the Nations to two earthen Pots driving in the Sea with this device, If we hurt, we break; He hit|ted it very well that hone&s;t man, and we may believe you are of the &s;ame opinion. But if the two Nations come to an Agreement, Oh Lord, what &s;tore of Hap|pine&s;s will this bring forth! The true Gods Service will be e&s;tabli&s;hed, the Sea be quiet, and Opportunity taken away from all Enemies to trouble them both; all Companions in Religion be re&s;oiled, and which is to be reputed the chiefe&s;t of all, To the mo&s;t good and gra|cious Lord, Prai&s;es and Thank&s;giving will be lift up in|to the Heavens. We conclude then, mo&s;t Honorable Lords, and in&s;tantly demand and de&s;ire, &s;o as we have longed to propo&s;e to your Honors this three days &s;ince;</P>
<PB N="30" REF="16">
<P>Fir&s;t, That a Copy may be given unto us of the Re|lation of the things that are pa&s;t.</P>
<P>Secondly, That we may &s;end that over by your leave to our Lords the States, and that the other part being heard, the truth of the Bu&s;ine&s;s may be known.</P>

<P>MY la&s;t Letter was of the twentieth in|&s;tant, &s;ent by the Me&s;&s;enger that brought my In&s;truction aboard, &s;ince when I cro&s;&s;ed the Sea before the Ma&s;e, <HI>Wi&s;|lingen, O&s;tend</HI> and <HI>Newport,</HI> until the twenty four of the &s;ame Moneth, when we were forced to ca&s;t our Anchor, and &s;tay there in a hard weather and a rough &s;ea, until the twen|ty
<PB N="31" REF="16">&s;ix in the morning: The weather grow|ing fairer, and being under Sail, divers Cap|tains of the <HI>Direction</HI> came aboard, complain|ing, That they lo&s;t their Anchors and Cables, &s;ome having but two Anchors &amp; two Cables left; It was re&s;olved, becau&s;e the wind did grow big, to go under the point of <HI>Dover</HI> for to prevent the lo&s;s of our Ships. At one of the clock coming before Downs, we did &s;end the Commander <HI>John Thi&s;&s;en</HI> from <HI>Fli&s;singen,</HI> and Captain <HI>Peter Alders</HI> towards the Downs to the Commander <HI>Bourn,</HI> who was there with &s;ome Ships of the Parliament, whom they &s;aluted in my Name, adverti&s;ing him that we were bound to cro&s;s the Sea about our coa&s;t; and that having lo&s;t &s;ome Anchors by the la&s;t hard weather, we were forced to Anchor under <HI>Dover,</HI> to help one another, and &s;o to return to our appointed limits; ha|ving al&s;o no other order, but to protect our Merchants Ships and Fi&s;hermen, and to maintain the honor of our Country: That we therefore thought it fit to acquaint the &s;aid Commander with the &s;ame, becau&s;e he &s;hould not &s;u&s;pect any thing to the contra|ry; who al&s;o with much courte&s;ie did &s;alute
<PB N="32" REF="17">me, and thank me for this notice. Upon the twenty nine, at two of the clock, we made &s;ail, the wind North ea&s;t, good weather, &s;ai|ling towards <HI>Calice,</HI> with intention to cro&s;s towards our coa&s;t, for to provide us of Ca|bles and Anchors: Coming about <HI>Calice</HI> Cliff, we met with Captain <HI>Ioris van Sanen</HI> of <HI>Am|&s;terdam,</HI> coming out the <HI>Streights,</HI> with Captain <HI>Hugeluyt,</HI> having in their Company &s;even rich Merchants Ships, who are e&s;teem|ed above fifty Tuns of Gold, who he left the twenty nine at Anchor, right again&s;t <HI>Feverley,</HI> where about twelve Ships of the Parliament did lye, and divers Frigots came to &s;ee them; and for as much as the &s;aid <HI>Ioris van Sanen</HI> up|on the twenty two of <HI>May,</HI> about <HI>Gout&s;tart,</HI> was met a Frigot of the Parliament, who fiercely &s;et upon him for to make him &s;trike, and again&s;t whom he defended him neer about two hours, and &s;o was left by the &s;aid Frigot, whereupon the &s;aid Commander <HI>Hugeluyt,</HI> and the &s;aid <HI>Van Sanen,</HI> &s;hould endeavor for to finde out our main Fleet, and to give us no|tice of it; as he did accordingly, fearing much, That the &s;aid Merchants Ve&s;&s;els alrea|dy might be taken: Whereupon I pre&s;ently
<PB N="33" REF="17">went thither, to take them under my protecti|on; and if they were taken, to put them at liberty, if it was po&s;sible, according to the &s;eventh and eighth Articles of my In&s;truction of the &s;ixteenth in&s;tant. Upon the way we met fifteen Ships and Frigots of the Parlia|ment, among whom one was an Admiral, whom I intended to view, taking in all my Sails, except both my Mur&s;hot Sails, whom we did avail until the midde&s;t of the &s;tangs. Being within a Canon-&s;hot, he &s;hot a Ball over our Ship, we an&s;wered not, he &s;hot an|other, to which we an&s;wered with one; pre|&s;ently he gives me a broad &s;ide, being within a Mu&s;quet &s;hot, and &s;hot all his &s;ide through our Ship and Sails: Divers were wounded, &s;ome with the lo&s;s of their Arms, &s;ome other|wi&s;e; thereupon we pre&s;ently gave him our broad&s;ide, not knowing what they intended, which for as yet I know not, becau&s;e they did not &s;peak a word to us, neither we to them, and we fell thereupon to a general fight. In mean while came the Commander <HI>Bourn</HI> out the Downs, with twelve of &s;uch like Ships and Frigots mounted, as he told him|&s;elf to the &s;aid Commander <HI>John Thy&s;&s;en,</HI> and
<PB N="34" REF="18">Captain <HI>Peter Alders,</HI> being aboard of him with &s;ixty to &s;eventy, and the Frigots with thirty eight to fifty pieces of Ordnance, who in the &s;ame while a&s;&s;aulted our Fleet from behinde; and we fought thus from half an hour pa&s;t four till nine of the clock, the darkne&s;s departing us from another; when both the Admirals a little beyond the reach of their Ordnance ca&s;t their Sails towards the Lee for to gather their Fleets, and to mend what was &s;hot to pieces, we floated the whole night with a light on every Ship. The thir|tieth in the morning, we &s;aw the Engli&s;h Fleet driven windward from us, who made Sail and went towards <HI>Dover.</HI> We wanted two of our Ships, who were in the rear of our Fleet: The Captains, <HI>Tuynmans</HI> of <HI>Middle|bourgh,</HI> and <HI>Siphe Fooks</HI> of <HI>Am&s;terdam,</HI> both Ships of the Direction, whereof we found that of Captain <HI>Siphe Fooks</HI> about noon float|ing without Ma&s;t; The Skipper and the Officers declared unto us that they were ta|ken by three Ships of the Parliament two hours after Sun&s;et, who took from aboard the Captain and the Lieutenant, with four|teen or fifteen men more, and putted in&s;tead
<PB N="35" REF="18">of them many of the Engli&s;h; but they fear|ing that the Ship would &s;ink, they took the flight, after they had plundred all in Ho&s;tile maner: They Declared al&s;o, That they &s;ee that the &s;aid <HI>Tuynmans</HI> (being with them in the rear of our Fleet) an hour before was ta|ken: We intend with this Ea&s;terly wind to cro&s;s to and fro, that we may finde out the &s;aid <HI>Streight</HI> fearders, if it be po&s;sible, and with all other Ships with whom we may meet, to bring them &s;afe in our Country: So ending was &s;ub&s;cribed</P>
