<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>IT would be needle&s;s, without doubt, by any Preliminary Di&s;cour&s;e, to recommend the Re|lations of TRAVELS to publick Peru|&s;al; &s;ince the univer&s;al Approbation they meet with in the World, and the eagerne&s;s wherewith they are &s;ought after by all People, is an Argu|ment convincing enough, that they are Delight|ful at lea&s;t, if not al&s;o Profitable. However, &s;eeing the Credit of Books of this Nature de|pends chiefly on the Places and Things that are de&s;cribed, and the Genius and capacity of the Tra|veller who ob&s;erves them. As the Title Page gives a general account of the fir&s;t; &s;o for the &s;econd, the Tran&s;lator hath borrowed a few Para|graphs concerning the Illu&s;trious Author, from the Gentleman who compiled and publi&s;hed the two la&s;t Parts of the&s;e Relations, in Execution of the la&s;t Will of him that made them, who Dying abroad in his Travels, bequeathed them in Legacy to his care; and the&s;e the Tran&s;lator doth premi&s;e by way of Preface, to prepare, but not fore&s;tal the Readers acceptance, and by &s;uch a &s;hort view and glance of the worthy Traveller, who ended his Days in endeavouring to promote
<PB REF="3">
Knowledge and improve Learning, to &s;hew how great his Abilities were in this kind.</P>
<P><HI>Mon&s;ieur de Thevenot,</HI> the Renowned Author of the&s;e Travels, was a Gentleman of a good Fami|ly, Born the &s;eventh of <HI>June,</HI> 1633. At Eigh|teen Years of Age he had accompli&s;h'd his Stu|dies in the College of <HI>Navarre,</HI> in the Univer|&s;ity of <HI>Paris,</HI> and then applied him&s;elf to tho&s;e Exerci&s;es, which in the breeding of Youth, com|monly &s;uccede to their School Education; till ha|ving both a de&s;ire and liberty to Travel; On the Eighteenth of <HI>December,</HI> 1652. he parted from <HI>Paris</HI> for <HI>England.</HI> He made no long &s;tay in this Country, but took the fir&s;t occa&s;ion of Sailing over to <HI>Holland,</HI> where he remained longer. His next remove was to <HI>Colen,</HI> and from <HI>Colen</HI> to <HI>Franckfort</HI> and <HI>Ratisbone,</HI> that he might &s;ee an Imperial <HI>Diet</HI> there. He afterwards cro&s;&s;ed the re|maining part of <HI>Germany,</HI> and entering <HI>Italy</HI> by the Mountains of <HI>Tirol,</HI> went fir&s;t to <HI>Verona,</HI> from thence to <HI>Venice;</HI> from <HI>Venice</HI> to <HI>Loretto;</HI> and from thence to <HI>Rome.</HI> He &s;tayed a con&s;ide|rable time there, becau&s;e when he was ju&s;t upon parting, <HI>Pope Innocent</HI> the Tenth Died; &s;o that he re&s;olved to tarry a little longer that he might &s;ee the Ceremonies, and all that happens on &s;uch Occa&s;ions, during a Conclave, and at the Coro|nation of a <HI>Pope.</HI> He left not <HI>Rome</HI> then, till after the Creation of <HI>Alexander</HI> the Seventh. The fir&s;t part of his Travels over mo&s;t part of <HI>Turkey, Egypt,</HI> the <HI>Holy Land,</HI> &amp;c. (which he him&s;elf put to the Pre&s;s) is an Account of what he had &s;een in
<PB REF="3">
that time, until he came back again to <HI>Legorn;</HI> from whence he made another Journey in <HI>Italy,</HI> that he might &s;ee all the other Places which he had not vi&s;ited the time before, and made &s;ome &s;tay at the Court of <HI>Savoy,</HI> before he returned into <HI>France.</HI> Our Author hath publi&s;hed nothing of the&s;e Travels; not but that he made a Relation of them, which he was at the pains to write out fair: But as he was a mode&s;t Man, and di&s;tru&s;tful of his own performances, he would not give it to be printed with the fir&s;t part of his Travels, which he him&s;elf handed to the Pre&s;s, thinking the&s;e were Countreys &s;ufficiently known already. It is indeed, but his fir&s;t E&s;&s;ay, yet perhaps not inferior to the exactne&s;s of more mature time. He therein gives you a &s;uccinct Account of all that is Curious in every place, and a character of the &s;everal People. In &s;hort, he &s;ays enough to give one a rea&s;onable in|formation of tho&s;e Countreys, and not too much, to cloy the Reader with the repetition of what he hath &s;een before. The Publi&s;her of the two la&s;t Parts of the&s;e Travels, has that Relation by him, but has as yet taken no re&s;olution what to do with it.</P>
<P>Our Illu&s;trious Traveller had not been long at home after his fir&s;t Travels, before the &s;ame Motives of Curio&s;ity and Learning, put him upon prepa|ring for a &s;econd Expedition, &s;o that privately he withdrew him&s;elf from his Friends, without taking leave, in order to travel over <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> and the <HI>Indies,</HI> which are the Subjects of the two la&s;t Parts of his Relations, and of the la&s;t part of his days; for as he was returning again through <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> into
<PB REF="4">
<HI>Europe,</HI> he Died at <HI>Miana,</HI> a little place about thirty Leagues from <HI>Tauris,</HI> the twenty eighth of <HI>November,</HI> 1667. his Ob&s;ervations ending but a few days before his Life; who&s;e Death, not only his Relations (to whom he was very dear) but even the publick hath rea&s;on to bewail, as having lo&s;t in him an Example of Piety, a Model of Vertue, and a Trea&s;ury of Knowledge. Nay, Reader, you al&s;o have cau&s;e to Lament this Lo&s;s, in relation to that Satisfaction you might have had from the la&s;t two Parts of his Relations; which would have been doubtle&s;s Augmented, if Providence had granted him longer Life. For <HI>Mon&s;ieur de Thevenot</HI> was not only exact in the daily Memoires he made in Travelling, of all things he ob&s;erved in the Coun|treys he pa&s;&s;ed through, but being a per&s;on very inqui&s;itive after the Truth, and who would not re&s;t &s;atisfied with every &s;light Information, he ad|dre&s;s'd him&s;elf to as many, and as often as po&s;&s;ibly he could, the better to find out the truth of what he de&s;ired to know, and di&s;per&s;ed the notices he had given him here and there confu&s;edly among his Memoires; &s;o that the Publi&s;her who imployed all imaginable care and pains in compiling them, is neverthele&s;s forced to complain of the great Fatigue he underwent, in putting them together in the order they &s;hould be, and are in. However, it is not to be thought, that there is any thing &s;uppo&s;i|titious or altered in the&s;e two la&s;t Parts; no, they are only not &s;o full as they would have been, had the Author lived to decipher the Short Notes, which were clear enough to him, though not alto|gether &s;o intelligible to others: And the truth is, the
<PB REF="4">
ingenious Publi&s;her is &s;o far from Alterations, that he would not &s;o much as change that for|reign Air and Dre&s;s they brought with them from Abroad, chu&s;ing rather to let them &s;peak in the naked and plain &s;train of the Author, than in the more elaborate Language of the Court and Town, which would chiefly be believed for their words-&s;ake. And indeed, he had rea&s;on &s;o to do, for a genuine and &s;imple &s;tyle, &s;uch as can rai&s;e a di&s;tinct Idea in the mind of the Reader, is the proper &s;tyle for particular and exact Rela|tions of things; and that was the Character of <HI>Mon&s;ieur de Thevenot,</HI> in the fir&s;t Part of his Tra|vels; which hath been &s;o well taken and appro|ved of by all Men of Breeding and Sen&s;e, that it would have been an Injury both to the Author and Reader to have Alter'd it.</P>
<P>The extraordinary Exactne&s;s of our Judicious Traveller, in ob&s;erving the Minute&s;t Particular of any thing that occurred to him abroad, may be di&s;lik'd perhaps, by &s;ome who mind their plea&s;ure more than profit, in Reading the Rela|tions of Travels, and had rather be &s;hamm'd with &s;ome Romantick idle Tales, than in&s;tructed in real and &s;ub&s;tantial Truths. But &s;eeing all his Ob&s;ervations are made with Judgment, that &s;eeming &s;uperfluous exactne&s;s can be no &s;mall Sa|tisfaction to the Curio&s;ity of all Ingenious Per|&s;ons, nor no incon&s;iderable Advantage neither to tho&s;e who Travel into the &s;ame Countries, when they &s;hall find the lea&s;t things ob&s;ervable on all the Roads he pa&s;t, &s;o particularly &s;et down and
<PB REF="5">
de&s;cribed, that a Traveller who hath the Book with him, may be able to tell as well as his Guide what kind of way and accommodation up|on the Road they are like to have, even &s;ome days before they Travel it; in&s;omuch, that it may be confidently affirmed, that no Almanack &s;o ex|actly de&s;cribes the Road from <HI>London</HI> to <HI>York,</HI> as our Indu&s;trious Author hath done it in that va&s;t extent of Countries he pa&s;s'd through; for which all Travellers ought to have a veneration for his Memory, and if they intend to make Publick any thing of this Nature, Imitate him if they can.</P>
<P>I am bold to &s;ay, if they can; becau&s;e, be&s;ides the &s;ingular Talents and Abilities <HI>Mon&s;ieur de The|venot</HI> had for Ob&s;ervation; he undertook his Tra|vels in a far more noble pro&s;pect, than that which carries a great many others &s;o far from home; who making their Trade their main bu&s;ine&s;s, cannot be&s;tow but the lea&s;t part of their Application up|on curious Ob&s;ervation. As for him, he was wholly devoted to it, and that with &s;o great A&s;|&s;iduity, that (according to the report of many who &s;aw him in tho&s;e Countries) he hardly al|lowed him&s;elf time to eat. It is ea&s;ie to judge of the va&s;tne&s;s of his Labour, by the reading of the&s;e Re|lations, wherein it appears, that he was con&s;tantly taken up in making Remarks generally on all things. But as a farther confirmation of this, the Gentleman who Publi&s;hed the two la&s;t Parts of the&s;e Travels, has now by him a Work made by the Author in the <HI>Indies,</HI> that gives a far greater proof of his exactne&s;s and pains. It is a Collection of
<PB REF="5">
all the Plants of tho&s;e Countries, which in Bota|nick terms is called a <HI>Hortus Siccus:</HI> it con&s;i&s;ts of five Volumes, wherein may be &s;een the natural Leaves of Plants, and Branches al&s;o of all &s;orts of Trees, of which the Leaves and Flowers of &s;ome, with their Pods, had not (when the &s;econd part of the&s;e Travels was fir&s;t Publi&s;hed) lo&s;t their Colour. All the&s;e are neatly pa&s;ted on one Page, and on the oppo&s;ite, you have the Name of the Plant in <HI>Portugue&s;e, Per&s;ian, Indian, Malabar</HI> and <HI>Banian:</HI> Then he gives a De&s;cription of the Plant, in &s;uch a manner, as not only &s;hews his exactne&s;s in all things, but his skill al&s;o in that Science, the &s;mal|le&s;t Filament is not omitted in it: He ob&s;erves the Places where the Plant is mo&s;t commonly to be found; the time when it is in Flower, bears Fruit, and its Vertues, if it have any that are known. The truth is, &s;o curious and elaborate a Work, might de&s;erve a better Fate, than to lye moulding in the bottom of a Trunk, and it is no &s;mall trouble to him who has it, that being unable to furni&s;h either Time or Expences for Publi&s;hing the &s;ame, he is forced &s;o to let it Peri&s;h in ob&s;curity; nor was it but only by chance neither, that he got the Figures of two of the&s;e Plants; and becau&s;e <HI>Mon&s;ieur de Thevenot,</HI> who &s;aw them before he began his Col|lection, had made an ample De&s;cription, and &s;mall De&s;ign of them in his Memoires.</P>
<P>A Work of this nature may very well rai&s;e a high notion of its Author; but it is a &s;urprizing thing, that at the &s;ame time he could pur&s;ue his other Ob&s;ervations of the Countrey, and &s;tudy
<PB REF="6">
the Languages, wherein he made great Progre&s;s, and hath given us the <HI>Malabar</HI> Alphabet, and &s;ome Rules of the Syntax of that Language. He had an extraordinary aptitude for Languages, for not to mention tho&s;e that are mo&s;t known in his own Countrey, he fully under&s;tood <HI>Turki&s;h, Arabick,</HI> and <HI>Per&s;ian,</HI> which enabled him to Know and Write, as he hath done, of tho&s;e People. And as his Ob&s;ervations, which are in a manner on all &s;orts of Subjects, require a notion of the mo&s;t part of Arts and Sciences, &s;o hath he evidently demon&s;trated, that &s;o many different Employ|ments enough to have bu&s;ied &s;everal Per&s;ons, have not at all diverted him from the Study of the mo&s;t &s;erious and difficult matters. The truth is, he had Parts that could reach and command any thing, was ingenious in unravelling Difficulties, laborious in Study, and con&s;tant in pur&s;uing what he &s;et about, &s;o that he attain'd to great knowledge in Natural Philo&s;ophy, Geometry, A&s;tronomy, and all the Mathematicks; and had e&s;pecially &s;tudied the Philo&s;ophy of <HI>De&s;cartes,</HI> rather that he might with plea&s;ure examine Natural Effects in their Principles, than Magi&s;terially dictate and decide, as tho&s;e who now a days make a &s;hew of that Philo&s;ophy, commonly do.</P>
<P>However, it is none of the lea&s;t <HI>Encomiums</HI> of <HI>Mon&s;ieur de Thevenot,</HI> that &s;o great Parts and &s;o much Learning, no way le&s;&s;ened his Zeal for Religion, wherein he has the univer&s;al Approba|tion of all who returned from tho&s;e Countries, or have Written of him to their Friends, who all
<PB REF="6">
extoll his Piety and Conduct, which was Civil and Regular, free from any of tho&s;e Extravagan|cies, that commonly decry his Countrey-Men among other Nations. He had a Patience that no cro&s;s Accident could &s;hake, an u&s;eful Quality to Travellers, but more particularly to all that Tra|vel into the <HI>Levant;</HI> and which is much to his Prai&s;e; he had acquired that Patience by Reflecti|ons no le&s;s Chri&s;tian than Solid, to wit, That no|thing befalls us, but by the Orders of Divine Providence, that always takes care of us; and this was often in his mouth as occa&s;ion offered. He had an ea&s;ie unaffected Conver&s;ation; and his na|tural and acquired Endowments enabling him to &s;peak pertinently on all Subjects, his company was very agreeable; neverthele&s;s, he &s;hewed always great Re&s;ervedne&s;s in di&s;cour&s;ing of his <HI>Travels,</HI> and was &s;o far from being importune upon that head, that nothing but Civility and Complai&s;ance could engage him to enlarge thereon; but then he did it in &s;o natural and &s;incere a manner, that he hath had the Art to leave all Men per&s;waded of his Probity and Veracity; and whether that good Opinion has been &s;pread by tho&s;e who knew him, or that his Writings bear a certain Air and Cha|racter of Truth; it is commonly the fir&s;t <HI>Encomium</HI> that tho&s;e who knew him not, give him, (when they have read his Travels) that they are a&s;&s;ured he &s;peaks the Truth. And &s;o much of the Illu|&s;trious Author.</P>
<P>But now as to the <HI>Engli&s;hing</HI> of this Work, &s;ince the Tran&s;lator has no body to Vouch for him, he
<PB REF="7">
mu&s;t e'en leave it to take its chance with the candid and good-natur'd Reader; whom he would never|thele&s;s have acquainted, that there were two or three words in the Original either not genuine French or Ob&s;olete, which no Dictionary Explained, nor any body that he could meet with, under&s;tood, and that the&s;e he hath made <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> as near as he could to the &s;en&s;e of the Context. If the more Critical Reader will needs Cavil at the Purity of the Stile; be&s;ides that the Stile of the Original is Plain and Natural; the Tran&s;lator has this to &s;ay for him|&s;elf, that he was &s;omewhat ha&s;tened and &s;traitned in time, it being thought fit that this Book &s;hould overtake the Travels of Sir <HI>John Chardin,</HI> of which the fir&s;t Part was lately Publi&s;hed, that for its Reputation &s;ake it might Travel over the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> World in &s;o good Company, and give and receive tho&s;e Mutual A&s;&s;i&s;tances, which Travellers are willing to impart to one another. The Reader then, is not to expect that the Language &s;hould be &s;o Accurate, nor the Style &s;o well turned, as if it had come abroad after many Reviews and Cor|rections: However the Tran&s;lator dares venture to affirm for him&s;elf, that in the main he hath not Swerved from the Authors Meaning; and that if he has not magnified his Sen&s;e, &s;o neither has he depre&s;s'd it.</P>
<P>It is hoped the Reader will be &s;atisfied, that the Tran&s;lator had rea&s;on to <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> the following Letter, written upon occa&s;ion of &s;ome words of <HI>Oriental Learning,</HI> that are variou&s;ly Accepted, in the Book of the <HI>Coronation of Solyman,</HI> and in the Second
<PB REF="7">
Part of our Authors Travels; for &s;ince the Pub|li&s;her of that Part thought fit to Con&s;ult a Lear|ned Critick in the <HI>Ea&s;tern</HI> Languages, for the Ju|&s;tification of <HI>Mon&s;ieur de Thevenot,</HI> who differed from Sir <HI>John Chardin</HI> in &s;ome Points of that &s;ort of Learning, and that the Book of the <HI>Coronation of Solyman,</HI> is now Publi&s;hed in <HI>Engli&s;h;</HI> the Tran|&s;lator could do no le&s;s than <HI>Verbatim</HI> to <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> the afore&s;aid Letter from the Original, that &s;o if any thing be altered in the new Edition or Tran&s;lation of it, the &s;tate of the Controver&s;ie may appear as it was at fir&s;t, and the Author be Vindicated, according to the intent of his Friend, who cannot be &s;u&s;pected to have mi&s;-quoted any pa&s;&s;age of the Book, no more than the Tran&s;lator to have done what he hath done, out of any pre|judice to it, or its Author, who is a Gentleman altogether unknown to him.</P>
<P>What <HI>Errata</HI> may be found in the Book, the Reader is de&s;ired to Correct, and not impute them to the Tran&s;lators Over&s;ight, who had not the Correcting of the Sheets.</P>

<HEAD>A LETTER FROM Mon&s;ieur de la Croix, SECRETARY and INTERPRETER TO THE FRENCH KING, Touching &s;ome Points of <HI>Oriental Learning,</HI> Contained in the SECOND PART of the&s;e TRAVELS.</HEAD>
<P>I Shall An&s;wer, Sir, in as few words as I can, the Note you did me the Honour to write to me, touching the apprehen&s;ions you had, that &s;ome words of Oriental Learning to be found in the Travels of <HI>Mon&s;ieur de Thevenot,</HI> may be found fault with, becau&s;e you meet with them in another &s;igni|fication, in the Treati&s;e called, the <HI>Coronation of Soly|man;</HI> but let me tell you, Sir, that Apprehen&s;ion &s;eems to me to be incon&s;i&s;tent with the Ju&s;tice you owe to that illu&s;trious Traveller; and that &s;ince you are not ignorant of the talents he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, it is your part to believe, that what he hath written, mu&s;t be right, and whatever cla&s;hes therewith cen|&s;ureable. His Fir&s;t Travels into the <HI>Levant,</HI> gained
<PB REF="9">
him the Knowledge of the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> rnd <HI>Arabick</HI> Lan|guages; and his &s;econd, of the <HI>Per&s;ian:</HI> The&s;e three Languages, which he was &s;o much Ma&s;ter of, and which are indi&s;pen&s;ably nece&s;&s;ary for the under|&s;tanding of Oriental Books, together with his skill in Hi&s;tory, Mathematicks, A&s;tronomy, Botanicks, and other Natural Sciences, wherein he excelled, render'd him &s;o accompli&s;h'd in all Oriental Learn|ing, as you mu&s;t needs have found by his private Memoires, that there are but few in the We&s;tern Parts who come near him in that, and none but may reap Profit from his In&s;tructions.</P>
<P>Nor do I in the lea&s;t doubt, but that he who hath written the Book of the <HI>Coronation of Solyman,</HI> is of the &s;ame opinion; and for in&s;tance, I cannot think he'll maintain that the word <HI>Mehter,</HI> which he attri|butes to the High Chamberlain of the King of <HI>Per|&s;ia,</HI> and makes a Superlative by the &s;ignification he gives it, is <HI>Arabick,</HI> when he finds that our Author affirms it to be a <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> word, and Comparative, &s;eeing its Superlative is <HI>Mehterin,</HI> which &s;ignifies the Greate&s;t.</P>
<P>I am very confident al&s;o, he will be ready to con|fe&s;s, that <HI>Toboat</HI> is an Arabick, and not a Per&s;ian word, and that he'll acknowledge, if he under&s;tand Arabick or Per&s;ian, that that word which &s;ignifies <HI>Coffins,</HI> hath not the Character of Per&s;ian Plurals, which commonly end in <HI>Ha,</HI> or in <HI>An;</HI> but of Arabick.</P>
<P>As to the word <HI>Divan beghi,</HI> which he &s;ays is cor|rupted from <HI>Divanum Begh,</HI> no &s;ence can be made of that Propo&s;ition, <HI>Divanum Begh</HI> having never been u&s;ed, neither in Turki&s;h nor in Per&s;ian, and is in|deed Non-&s;en&s;e. On the contrary, <HI>Divan beghi,</HI> which &s;ignifies (as our Author &s;ays) <HI>Lord of the Divan,</HI> is very good Turki&s;h, and exactly agreeable to the Syntax of that Language.</P>
<P>Nor have you any greater cau&s;e of fear, for the two words of <HI>Turban</HI> and <HI>Munedgim,</HI> you take notice of to me, as made u&s;e of by our Author. The Au|thor of the <HI>Coronation of Solyman</HI> may &s;ay what he will; but he would have done very ill to have writ|ten
<PB REF="9">
<HI>Dhulbant;</HI> that would be a word as mon&s;trous in a French or Engli&s;h Book, as in the Mouth of him that &s;hould pronounce it. <HI>Turban</HI> is now a vul|gar European word, e&s;tabli&s;hed by Cu&s;tome, and <HI>Dhulbandt</HI> a Per&s;ian word, provided it were written according to its true Orthography, (for it ought to be written <HI>Dulband.</HI>) And when a European &s;peaks his own Language, and would be under&s;tood, he ought not to u&s;e Exotick words, when his own Country Language can do the thing; &s;o as a Man &s;peaking French or Engli&s;h would render him&s;elf ridiculous, &s;hould he &s;ay <HI>Chimichir</HI> in&s;tead of <HI>Cimeter,</HI> though the one come from the other. But there is more to be &s;aid as to this; for the word <HI>Dulband</HI> &s;ig|nifies not in Per&s;ian, what in French or Engli&s;h is meant by <HI>Turban</HI> (as the Author of the <HI>Coronation of Solyman</HI> thinks,) and in&s;tead of blaming Writers who under&s;tood not the language, and of &s;aying that the King's Cap was tied round in manner of a <HI>Dhulbandt</HI> with a fine Cloth, he ought to have &s;aid (&s;ince he pretends that Per&s;ian words are to be u&s;ed) that the King's Cap was tied in manner of a <HI>De&s;tar,</HI> which is the <HI>Turban,</HI> by a <HI>Dulband,</HI> or fine Cloth, &s;eeng the <HI>Dulband</HI> is but a part of the <HI>Turban,</HI> which in Per&s;ian is called <HI>De&s;ter,</HI> as in Turki&s;h <HI>Sarick,</HI> and only &s;igni|fies the Cloth that is wreated about the <HI>Kaouk</HI> or Cap of the <HI>Turban;</HI> and by a <HI>Turban,</HI> is under&s;tood the whole Head-attire, after the Ea&s;tern way.</P>
<P>Now for the word <HI>Munedgim,</HI> which &s;ignifies A&s;trologer, and is u&s;ed by our Author, there is no di&s;pute to be made about it: The word <HI>Munehizym,</HI> made u&s;e of in the Book of the <HI>Coronation,</HI> is not a word of the Language, and is indeed, in&s;ignificant; but the word in que&s;tion, is altogether a term of Learning, and is purely Arabick, the root of it being <HI>Nedgem,</HI> whereof the radical letters are <HI>Nun, Dgm, Mim,</HI> among which as you &s;ee, there is neither <HI>H</HI> nor <HI>Z,</HI> and therefore it mu&s;t be <HI>Munedgim.</HI></P>
<P>It is not the &s;ame with the word <HI>Khanum,</HI> inter|preted in the Book of the <HI>Coronation,</HI> by that of Dutche&s;s; it is more a word of Court than of Art, but for all that it is nothing the wor&s;e employed by
<PB REF="10">
our Author, and tho&s;e who are well acquainted with the Court of the King of <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> &s;ay as he does, that <HI>Begum</HI> is the Title of the Queens and Prince&s;&s;es, and <HI>Khanum</HI> that of the chief Ladies of his Serraglio. And I wonder, as well as you, at the meaning which is given to that word in the Book of the <HI>Coronation of Solyman,</HI> &s;eeing it hath no Character that comes near the Natural &s;ignification of <HI>Khanum,</HI> and far le&s;s the Artificial, which at mo&s;t makes it only to &s;ignifie a Beloved Lady. This word hath its Original from Galantry; the Etymology of it is <HI>Khan,</HI> u&s;ed in <HI>Per|&s;ia</HI> chiefly to &s;ignifie the Commander or Governour of a Province or Town, and the two other letters, or rather the Con&s;onant <HI>M,</HI> with the Vowel or Mo|tion that accompanies it, is an adjunct Particle, which both in Turki&s;h and Per&s;ian &s;tands in place of a Pronoun po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ive of the fir&s;t Per&s;on: And &s;o the word <HI>Khanum</HI> &s;ignifies my <HI>Khan,</HI> my Commander, my Governour in the Ma&s;culine gender, which hath been given by the Kings of <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> to the Women they pa&s;&s;ionately loved, in the &s;ame manner as &s;ome Amorous Man might in Engli&s;h call a Lady who commanded all his affections, his Conquerour; and this is very far from the &s;erious &s;ignification of Dutche&s;s, as it is found in the Book of the <HI>Corona|tion of Solyman.</HI></P>
<P>And now, Sir, as to what remains of your Note, to wit, the two words of <HI>Sarazins</HI> and <HI>Sofi;</HI> certainly there is no fault to be found with the learning of <HI>Mon&s;ieur de Thevenot</HI> in neither of the two; and when he affirms that <HI>Sarazins</HI> comes from <HI>Sarak</HI> to Rob, no exceptions can be taken thereat. There is much more to be &s;aid again&s;t the Etymology of that word mentioned in the Book of the <HI>Coronation of Solyman,</HI> notwith&s;tanding the long di&s;&s;ertation in&s;erted in it, and the in&s;ulting over tho&s;e who therein are called Relation-makers, nay and the ancient Hi&s;torians them&s;elves. How! in God's name, would he who hath written that Book, have <HI>Sarazin</HI> to come from <HI>Sara Netchim,</HI> and where does he find this Etymo|logy? If he have any Knowledge of the Oriental Languages, which I cannot be po&s;itive in, as not
<PB REF="10">
having the honour of being acquainted with him, Ought he not to know when there is any que&s;tion about Etymology, at lea&s;t, in the&s;e Languages, that the Radical letters decide the point? How then can <HI>Sarazins</HI> in French or Engli&s;h, <HI>Saraceni</HI> in La|tin, from which we have borrowed it, or in Greek <GAP DESC="foreign">, and in Arabick <HI>Sarakioun</HI> be derived from <HI>Sara Netchim,</HI> or (to gratifie his thought more) from <HI>Sara Nechin,</HI> &s;eeing according to the very letters which he a&s;&s;igns to <HI>Sara Nechin,</HI> the chief character of <HI>Nechin,</HI> which is the fir&s;t of <HI>Nun,</HI> is not at all in <HI>Sarazin,</HI> as the <HI>Chin</HI> which he eludes, and makes the Engli&s;h his Vouchers for it, cannot be. But from the Etymology, let us proceed to the Signification; Where hath that Author found that <HI>Sara Netchin</HI> &s;ignifies tho&s;e that &s;eat them&s;elves in the Fields? This word hath &s;everal &s;ignifications, which have no affinity to that. The word which &s;ignifies a De|&s;art, or barren Plain, is <HI>Sahhra,</HI> with a <HI>hh,</HI> which can in no manner of way, no more than the <HI>Sad,</HI> wherewith that word begins, enter into the Etymo|logy of <HI>Sarazins,</HI> &s;eeing Oriental Authors have never u&s;ed a <HI>Hha</HI> nor <HI>Sad,</HI> in writing the Plural <HI>Sarakioun</HI> or <HI>Sarakin, Sarazins,</HI> whereof the Arabick root is <HI>Sarak</HI> to Rob (the chief bu&s;ine&s;s of that People) that hath for Radical letters a <HI>Sin, a Re,</HI> and a <HI>Kof,</HI> which <HI>Kof</HI> the Greeks mark by a <HI>Kappa,</HI> and we as well as the Latins, by a <HI>C,</HI> the pronunciation whereof we have &s;oftened by a <HI>Z,</HI> or an <HI>S,</HI> &s;aying <HI>Sarazins</HI> or <HI>Sara&s;ins,</HI> in&s;tead of <HI>Saracins:</HI> Whereupon it is fur|ther to be ob&s;erved, that the Sarazins are not the <HI>Turcomans,</HI> as is mentioned in the Book of the <HI>Corona|tion:</HI> The&s;e la&s;t came from the farthe&s;t North, and the <HI>Sarazins</HI> from the South. When fir&s;t the word <HI>Sarazins</HI> or <HI>Saracins</HI> came into u&s;e, it was not known what the <HI>Turcomans</HI> were. The name of <HI>Sarazins</HI> was given to the I&s;hmaeliti&s;h Arabians, or the <HI>Agareneans,</HI> to wit, the Arabs of the De&s;art, who live not in Towns, and who practice at pre&s;ent (as they did many Ages &s;ince) the trade of Robbing, which got them the name of <HI>Sarazins,</HI> without doubt, long before the Engli&s;h, who pronounce the <HI>Shin</HI> as
<PB REF="11">
ea&s;ily as the French do, could have changed that letter of the Per&s;ian Verb <HI>Netchinem,</HI> into a <HI>Zin,</HI> as it is very ill &s;uppo&s;ed in the Book of the <HI>Coronation of Solyman.</HI></P>
<P>The Author of the &s;ame Book takes it ill al&s;o, that one &s;hould &s;ay the <HI>Great Sofi,</HI> &s;peaking of the King of <HI>Per&s;ia:</HI> Indeed that term were to be blamed, if u&s;ed in &s;peaking or writing to a King of <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> or even to a Per&s;ian. <HI>Texeira</HI> and others have long ago written, that it is a term not to be u&s;ed; but they have not &s;aid, that no King of <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> ever car|ried that name, as the Book of the <HI>Coronation</HI> does. The&s;e Per&s;ons were too well acquainted with the Oriental Hi&s;tory, to do &s;o. And when <HI>Mon&s;ieur de Thevenot</HI> writes <HI>I&s;mael Sofi,</HI> he makes it apparent enough, that he hath read the Ea&s;tern Authors, and knew that the name of <HI>Sofi</HI> hath been one of the chief means which rai&s;ed the Family that at pre|&s;ent Reigns in <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> to the Throne. The fir&s;t King of it joyned the Name or Sirname of <HI>Sofi,</HI> to that of <HI>I&s;mael,</HI> and took it in imitation of his Father and Grandfather, who had already made &s;everal Attempts to rai&s;e them&s;elves by Power, above the re&s;t of their Country-men: And both the&s;e Per&s;ons affected to be called <HI>Sofies,</HI> that they might pre&s;erve in their Family the Reputation and number of Friends, which their Ance&s;tors, whom they aver|red to be de&s;cended of <HI>Aly,</HI> by one of the <HI>Imams,</HI> had acquired to them, when they were Chief of that Order and Sect of <HI>Sofies,</HI> in later times grown formidable. That Sect, which in the time of its Piety, applied it &s;elf particularly to My&s;tical Theo|logy and Contemplation, was in Mahometani&s;m the mo&s;t Puritanical of all the Sects of the Ea&s;t; and in the French Kings Library, there are entire Manu|&s;cripts of the Rules that it ob&s;erved.</P>
<P>The great e&s;teem that <HI>I&s;mal</HI> knew his Forefa|thers had acquired under that Name, made him think it would be much for his advantage to take it; and he was not mi&s;taken, for he was fir&s;t fol|lowed
<PB REF="11">
by all the <HI>Sofies,</HI> and tho&s;e who were addic|ted unto them, by who&s;e means he E&s;tabli&s;hed the Belief, which his Father and Grandfather had but in a manner propo&s;ed, to wit, that <HI>Aly</HI> being the only true Heir of <HI>Mahomet,</HI> he was to be followed in all things, by tho&s;e who would be &s;aved. And the truth is, they conceived &s;o high an opinion of that <HI>Sofi,</HI> that the Friends of his Family, with the Malecontents and Innovators, ea&s;ily joyned with him, and he as ea&s;ily employed them to de&s;troy <HI>Farochk</HI> King or Sultan of <HI>Schirvan,</HI> who had put to Death his Father <HI>Aidar.</HI></P>
<P>This having &s;ucceeded &s;o well with <HI>I&s;mael Sofi,</HI> he found means afterwards to attack and overcome the other Sultans of <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> who were of the Family of <HI>Akkoionlu,</HI> and to mount the Throne of the Empire him&s;elf. So that it is not true, that none of the Kings of <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> ever bore the Name of <HI>Sofi,</HI> though &s;ince <HI>I&s;mael</HI>'s time, the&s;e Kings have forborn to take it, having depre&s;&s;ed that Order of the <HI>Sofies,</HI> for rea&s;ons that I could alledge el&s;ewhere; and be&s;ides, they &s;tood no more in need of Artifice to maintain their grandeur. This is that <HI>Sha I&s;mael Sofi</HI> who gave occa&s;ion to the Europeans to call the Kings of <HI>Per&s;ia Sofies,</HI> as from <HI>Cae&s;ar,</HI> they called the &s;ucceed|ing Emperours <HI>Cae&s;ars;</HI> and from <HI>O&s;man</HI> or <HI>Othman,</HI> tho&s;e of <HI>Turkie, Ottomans.</HI></P>
<P>I mu&s;t al&s;o tell you, that one ought not to take exceptions, if he meet with &s;ome diver&s;ity in the pronunciation of Oriental words in this Book, e&s;pe|cially when the que&s;tion is about Vowels, or the Con&s;onants <HI>Kha, Hha, Kef,</HI> and &s;ome others: In dif|ferent Countreys they are variou&s;ly pronounced; in &s;ome places they pronounce <HI>Nameh, Bender,</HI> and <HI>Bazerghian;</HI> and in others <HI>Namah, Bendar, Bazerghion:</HI> Some &s;ay <HI>Kher,</HI> and others <HI>Hher;</HI> &s;ome <HI>Gomron,</HI> others <HI>Komoron,</HI> and &s;o in many others; but the figurative letters always occur in both the one and the other.</P>
<P><PB REF="12">Thus you &s;ee, Sir, that <HI>Mon&s;ieur de Thevenot</HI> is &s;ufficiently Ju&s;tified, as to the points you &s;u&s;pec|ted might be cavelled at, if con&s;idered with rela|tion to the Book of the <HI>Coronation of Solyman,</HI> upon which I pretend not to play the Critick, nor indeed, have I fully examined it: And this An&s;wer, though &s;omewhat long in re&s;pect of your Note, is only to &s;atisfie your de&s;ires, and that duty of Friend&s;hip wherewith our Illu&s;trious Traveller honoured me, as well as the &s;trict Obligation that lies upon me, to have an eternal veneration for his Memory.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. I.</HI> The Travellers De&s;ign.</HEAD>
<P>THE de&s;ire of Travelling (which is as old as Human Nature) &s;eems to be at pre&s;ent, a more prevailing pa&s;&s;ion than ever:<NOTE PLACE="marg">The de&s;ire of Travelling more ardent now a days than ever.</NOTE> In all parts of the World we meet with Travellers, which confirm the truth of what I &s;ay; and the many Printed Re|lations of their Ob&s;ervations which have been made Publick within the&s;e twenty years, put it out of all doubt. All who are curious, delight in the Rarities they &s;ee; and there are but few, who if they were not otherwi&s;e engaged, would not willingly be them&s;elves the witne&s;&s;es and &s;pectatours of them: The&s;e plea&s;ing Relations rai&s;ed in my mind the fir&s;t thoughts of Travelling; and &s;eeing in the Year one thou&s;and &s;ix hundred fifty two, I had no con&s;iderable Affairs that might ob&s;truct my inclination, I ea&s;ily re&s;olved to follow it. I began with <HI>England,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The begin|ning of the Author's Tra|vels.</NOTE> proceeded by <HI>Holland</HI> and <HI>Germany,</HI> and then vi&s;ited <HI>Italy;</HI> but till I have pa&s;t <HI>Naples,</HI> I &s;hall make no particular Ob&s;ervation of the&s;e Countries, &s;ince tho&s;e things that recommend them to &s;trangers, are &s;ufficiently known to all my Countrymen: having &s;atisfied my curio&s;ity with all that <HI>Rome</HI> could afford, I re&s;olved not to &s;top there, but to advance and inform my &s;elf of what was worthy of knowledge in other Countries, whereof I had but imperfect Conceptions: But then it behoved me to con&s;ider which way I &s;hould direct my Travels, and, that I might not Travel in vain, provide my &s;elf of means and nece&s;&s;ary in&s;tructions to render them u&s;eful. God Almighty offered me an occa&s;ion; for at <HI>Rome</HI> I found a <HI>French</HI> Gentleman,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A very lear|ned Man.</NOTE> who &s;eriou&s;ly applied him&s;elf to the knowledge of the Affairs of the <HI>Levant;</HI> he was in &s;o high reputation among the Learned, that he was courted by all who loved &s;olid Learning, becau&s;e in him alone they found abundantly, what was but very rarely to be met with among&s;t all others. Though the greate&s;t part of his time was taken up in conver&s;ation with the mo&s;t learned Cardinals, and the other mo&s;t con&s;iderable Prelates of <HI>Rome;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Authors Friend&s;hip with <HI>Moun|&s;ieur d' Herbe|lot.</HI></NOTE> yet I made &s;o good u&s;e of his acquain|tance, that he was plea&s;ed to admit me into his Friend&s;hip, and I admir'd to find by experience, the truth of what I had been told by others: At fir&s;t I found him to be a man &s;o accompli&s;hed in Liberal Sciences, and in the Greek and
<PB N="2" REF="21">
Latin Tongues, that he might be ranked among the able&s;t Profe&s;&s;ors of the &s;ame; and &s;o much Ma&s;ter of the Hebrew, that he not only under&s;tood Hebrew Books, but all the <HI>Rabins</HI> to the depth; and he Di&s;puted again&s;t the Jewi&s;h Doctours or <HI>Hakans,</HI> to whom he explained the Prophets and Old Te&s;tament with &s;o much advantage to our Faith, &s;o &s;ubtilly, and with &s;o good &s;ucce&s;s, that I dare be bold to &s;ay, he &s;tartled and &s;hook mo&s;t of them: They were &s;o taken with his Learning, that they importuned him with their vi&s;its, and (after a conver&s;ation of three or four hours continuance, with their Books in their hands) I have &s;een them take their leaves of him with regret, for that it &s;eemed, that the time which he was obliged to be&s;tow upon his other friends, was robbed from them. He was no le&s;s skilful in the Chaldaick and Syriack Tongues; at that time he excelled in the Arabick, Turki&s;h and Per&s;ian Languages, whereof he hath &s;o well improved the Books &s;ince, that I may confidently &s;ay, he is in all the&s;e Languages the mo&s;t knowing man in <HI>Europe.</HI> I place not only his Skill in the &s;peaking of the&s;e Tongues, and under&s;tanding their Books, but chiefly in their Learning and Knowledge of mo&s;t things of the Ea&s;t; whereof he never &s;peaks but &s;o intelligently, that almo&s;t all that hear him are ravi&s;hed and &s;urpri&s;ed with his Erudition. This knowledge of &s;o many Oriental Languages, hath &s;o accompli&s;hed him in all kind of Hi&s;tory, both Ancient and Modern, from which he hath collected &s;o many particularities, that our Geographers and Hi&s;torians do but &s;eem to be in the dark as to tho&s;e things which he could make out with cer|tainty: He is no le&s;s knowing in other Sciences than in Languages, and being of a humour far from vanity, and the temper of tho&s;e Learned men, who di&s;dain to conver&s;e with &s;uch as know le&s;s than them&s;elves; but on the contrary, making a my&s;tery of nothing, and frankly di&s;cour&s;ing with any man upon what Subject he propo&s;es, informing him of that he knows; I failed not to embrace the occa&s;ion, and make the be&s;t of a friend&s;hip that was &s;o u&s;eful unto me. He imparted to me all that he had learnt from the Levantines, with whom he had conver&s;ed, not only as to their maners and method of conduct, but al&s;o as to what circum&s;pections I was to u&s;e on many occa&s;ions; and in &s;hort, he made me determine to Travel into the <HI>Levant.</HI> I was overjoyed when he told me that he him&s;elf intended to make the voyage, I hugg'd my &s;elf a long while, in hopes of &s;o good company; and made no doubt but that with &s;o great a&s;&s;i&s;tances, I might be able upon my return, to give the World an account of all the Rarities that the Ea&s;t produces in Learning, Art and Nature: But when we were upon the point of embarking, there happen'd to Mon&s;ieur <HI>Herbelot</HI> (that was the Gentleman's name) a dome&s;tick Affair, of &s;o great con&s;equence, that it inter|rupted his de&s;ign, and obliged him to defer his departure: I patiently bore with that misfortune, becau&s;e he promi&s;ed to meet me at <HI>Malta,</HI> and &s;eeing I had put my &s;elf in a readine&s;s to embark in one of the Pope's Gallies, that was to touch at <HI>Naples,</HI> into which the <HI>French</HI> at that time had no admi&s;&s;ion; he advi&s;ed me not to let &s;lip &s;o fair an opportunity, and accordingly I did not. I parted from <HI>Rome</HI> on <HI>Monday, May</HI> 31. 1655, and <HI>June</HI> 2. embarked at <HI>Civita Vecchia,</HI> in the Galley commanded by the Count <HI>Gaddi,</HI> from whom I re|ceived all the te&s;timonies of a noble Genero&s;ity. The fourth of <HI>June</HI> the Gallies &s;topt eight miles from <HI>Naples:</HI> And the fifth being &s;pent in the Pa&s;&s;engers veiwing of that City, we parted on <HI>Sunday</HI> the &s;ixth of <HI>June,</HI> towards the evening, and made &s;ail for <HI>Sicily:</HI> We &s;aw in our pa&s;&s;age the fire of the Mountain of the I&s;le of <HI>Stromboli,</HI> and I was told that they who were near it heard great howlings, which proceed not from Hell (of which the &s;illy people of the Country think the top of this hill to be the mouth) but from the violence of the Winds; which breaking impetuou&s;ly into the va&s;t concavities that have been hollowed by the Sea, and there kindling in the &s;ulphur-mines, whereof that Country is full, the flame that has made and pre&s;erved to it &s;elf a pa&s;&s;age through the Mountain, makes a noi&s;e like to the howlings of the damned. <HI>Tue&s;day</HI> the eight of <HI>June,</HI> about night, we pa&s;&s;ed the Phare of <HI>Me&s;&s;ina,</HI> and next day, <HI>Wedne&s;day,</HI> the ninth of <HI>June</HI> we came in the night-time, before <HI>Me&s;&s;ina,</HI> and dropt Anchor without the Port. <HI>Thur&s;day,</HI> the tenth of <HI>June,</HI> we went a&s;hore, and walked about the Town with more freedom than we had done at <HI>Naples:</HI> I &s;hall &s;peak of it in &s;hort.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. II.</HI> Of <HI>Me&s;&s;ina.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE Town of <HI>Me&s;&s;ina</HI> lies on that &s;ide of <HI>Sicily</HI> which looks to <HI>Rhegio,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Me&s;&s;ina.</NOTE> in <HI>Italy,</HI> from which it is but Three&s;core Miles di&s;tant. It is &s;ituated in the place where the Town of <HI>Zande</HI> &s;tood, and had the Name of <HI>Me&s;&s;ina,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Zande.</NOTE> from the <HI>Me&s;&s;inians</HI> of <HI>Pelopone&s;us,</HI> who built and inhabited it; it hath a &s;afe Harbour, made &s;o by Nature, which would &s;eem to have been mea&s;ured with the Com|pa&s;s, &s;o round and proportioned it is. On the Shoar, round this Port, there are &s;everal fair Palaces of uniform Building, which offer a plea&s;ant Pro&s;pect to tho&s;e that enter the Port, but they have not been continued. At the end of the Mole, which &s;huts in this Port, there is a Tower to &s;ecure the Entry; much about the middle of the &s;aid Mole &s;tands another Tower, on the top of which there is a great Light kindled every night, to let Ships out at Sea know where they are. This is but a kind of a melancholy Town, though the Streets be fair and large; in viewing of it, I &s;aw written over the Door of the Cathedral Church, in pretty large ancient Characters, <HI>Gran-Mercy a Me&s;&s;ine;</HI> when the <HI>French</HI> became Ma&s;ters of <HI>Sicily, Me&s;&s;ina</HI> was the fir&s;t place that &s;urrendred unto them, and that the memory of it might be pre&s;erved, they cau&s;ed that In&s;cription to be made. Before this &s;tately and large Church, there is a great Square or Piazza, with a Theatre in the middle of it, where the Victory of <HI>Lepanto</HI> is repre&s;ented on Bra&s;s, and a Brazen Statue of <HI>Don John</HI> of <HI>Au&s;tria</HI> &s;tands. The Novitiate of the Je&s;uites &s;tands upon a Hill higher than any place of the Town; and &s;eeing the whole Town and Harbor may be &s;een from the Gardens of it, I readily embraced the offer that a Je&s;uite made me of carrying me to them: Having pa&s;s'd through &s;ome &s;pacious walks, he led me to a very high Garden,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Scylla. Charibdis.</NOTE> from whence he &s;hewed me <HI>Scylla</HI> and <HI>Charibdis,</HI> which heretofore rendred that Streight &s;o dangerous, that all that pa&s;s'd it thought them&s;elves certainly lo&s;t. <HI>Scylla</HI> is a Rock, pretty near a Ca&s;tle, on the <HI>Italian</HI> Shoar, over again&s;t the <HI>Phare of Me&s;&s;ina;</HI> this Ca&s;tle is called <HI>Scyllio,</HI> from whence that Rock hath had the Name of <HI>Scylla.</HI> As for <HI>Charibdis,</HI> it is near and oppo&s;ite to the Port of <HI>Me&s;|&s;ina,</HI> but is not dangerous but when two contrary Eddies meet, which making Ve&s;&s;els turn round for &s;ome time, &s;uck them down to the bottom without remedy: To avoid them, one mu&s;t keep as near, or as far off of the Port as po&s;&s;ibly can be, for the danger is in the middle, betwixt the Port and the Land of <HI>Italy,</HI> on the other &s;ide. Though the greate&s;t danger be in that place, yet the Port is not free from it, for the Je&s;uite told me, that it hath &s;ometimes happened, that a Ship being got into the Harbour, and having &s;aluted the Town, hath been carried out again by the currents, and ca&s;t away in &s;ight of the place. The old Proverb, <HI>Incidit in Scyllam cupiens vitare Charibdim,</HI> was not &s;aid without rea&s;on; for when Men have avoided the danger of one of the&s;e Rocks, they may very ea&s;ily fall upon the other, if they have not a care: The Fable which &s;aid, that <HI>Charibdis</HI> and <HI>Scylla</HI> were two Sea Mon&s;ters, &s;urrounded with Dogs that barked, has its original from the great noi&s;e the&s;e Waters make, by beating and cla&s;hing one again&s;t another; &s;o that, e&s;pecially when they beat again&s;t <HI>Scylla,</HI> one would think it were the barking of great Dogs. Now to prevent the ca&s;ting away of Ships in tho&s;e Pa&s;&s;ages, the <HI>Me&s;&s;ine&s;es</HI> have always a great many Pilots purpo&s;ely in readine&s;s,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Pilots hired by the <HI>Me&s;&s;i|ne&s;es.</HI></NOTE> and payed by the City, of whom there is always one &s;tanding Sentinel upon a high Tower; and when Ships, or other Ve&s;&s;els, finding them&s;elves in imminent dan|ger, fire a Gun, the&s;e Pilots fail not to put off in their Boats and a&s;&s;i&s;t them. The Je&s;uite led me into another Garden higher than the re&s;t, hard by which there is a Ba&s;tion that Commands the Town, and all that Hou&s;e of the Je&s;uites;
<PB N="4" REF="22">
he told me that there were eighteen &s;trong Ca&s;tles in <HI>Me&s;&s;ina,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Eighteen Ca|&s;tles in <HI>Me&s;|&s;ina.</HI> The <HI>Me&s;&s;ine&s;e</HI> jealous of the <HI>Spaniards.</HI></NOTE> of which the <HI>Spaniards</HI> held but four, the re&s;t being in the hands of the <HI>Me&s;&s;ine&s;es,</HI> who are &s;o jealous of the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> that the&s;e having built a Fort at the end of the Port, they made another on the oppo&s;ite &s;ide of the Water, a Musket &s;hot only di&s;tant from that of the <HI>Spaniards.</HI> This is a very rich Town, by rea&s;on of the great Trade in Silk that is driven there: They have no Inns for Strangers, which is a great inconvenience to them, being obliged to lodge in a wretched Tavern upon the Harbour, which they call the <HI>Barraque,</HI> where the Entertainment is very bad: All things are cheap there; the Wine is &s;trong, but very bad; and this City is an Archi-epi&s;copal See.</P>

The Je&s;uites have al&s;o a very well built Hou&s;e, and keep Colledge there: All the Hou&s;es, even to the meane&s;t, make a very good &s;hew, being built of &s;quare Stones, cut out of the Rock, which does not co&s;t them much, for the Rock is very &s;oft; and, when a Man is about to build, the fir&s;t thing he does, is to make his Ci&s;tern, becau&s;e, out of it he gets Stones that &s;erve in the Building; and the re&s;t he has about the Town, for they have them for their labour: This is a kind of Stone that long retains its whitene&s;s, &s;o that the Town &s;eems &s;till to be new: All the Hou&s;es of it are built with a terra&s;s, or flat Roof, and one may go from one &s;treet to another upon the terra&s;&s;es of the hou&s;es.

The Streets of this Town are incommodious, in that one is always going either up hill or down hill; but they are wide and &s;treight, and, for the mo&s;t part, begin and end at the Town Walls; the faire&s;t of all, is, the Street that reaches from the Ca&s;tle St. <HI>Erme,</HI> to the Royal Gate; it is almo&s;t a mile in length; and here it is, that they make Hor&s;es and A&s;&s;es run the <HI>Pallio,</HI> on days of Publick Rejoycing.

<P>THE Countrey is full of Gardens, and very agreeable Places of Plea&s;ure:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Walks of <HI>Mal|ta.</HI></NOTE> The Grove, which is but twelve miles from the New Town, is a delightful place, whither the Great Ma&s;ters commonly go to divert them&s;elves: This place was embelli&s;hed by the Great Ma&s;ter <HI>Verdala,</HI> who was made a Cardinal; there he built a Palace, in form of a Ca&s;tle, with &s;o much uniformity and contrivance, that there is not &s;o much as a foot of ground lo&s;t; all the Halls are adorned with excellent Painting, which repre&s;ents the Life of the Great Ma&s;ter <HI>Verdala:</HI> This Hou&s;e hath a very neat Garden, full of Orange, Citron and Olive-Trees, with &s;everal lovely Fountains: At &s;ome di&s;tance from the Hou&s;e, there is a little Wood, &s;tocked with Game, for the Plea&s;ure of the Great Ma&s;ters. In going to this place of diver&s;ion, you pa&s;s near to the Old Town, which is not far from it: It is &s;ituated in the middle of the I&s;land, upon an indifferent high Hill, of a plea&s;ant Pro&s;pect; it is inviron'd with Precipices and Bottoms, and adorned with lovely Fabricks within: Pretty near to this Town, is the Grot where St. <HI>Paul</HI> lodged all the while he was in <HI>Malta;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Our Lady</HI> of Melecca.</NOTE> where there is an Image of our Lady, called <HI>Our Lady of</HI> Melecca, and, as they &s;ay, many Mira|cles are wrought at it: One may al&s;o go and walk in the I&s;le of <HI>Gozo,</HI> which is but five miles from <HI>Malta:</HI> This little I&s;le is thirty miles in circuit, twelve in length, and &s;ix in breadth.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Zia.</NOTE><HI>T&V;e&s;day, November</HI> the Ninth, the weather promi&s;ing fair, after we had payed the Con&s;ul a <HI>Pia&s;tre</HI> or peice of Eight, for Anchorage, we weighed about noon; but being abroad, we found that the wind was not good as we had imagined it was; for it &s;hifted to and agen from Ea&s;t to North, and was &s;o ea&s;ie, that we made no way. <HI>Wedne&s;day,</HI> the Tenth of <HI>November,</HI> we were becalmed till the evening, when, to our great joy, we had a Gale from South-we&s;t, but in the night-time it chang'd about to We&s;t, with which we &s;till kept on our cour&s;e: It la&s;ted till <HI>Thur&s;day</HI> morning, the Eleventh of <HI>November,</HI> when, about eight a clock, we were becalmed until the evening, that the wind turned ea&s;terly, then north ea&s;terly, and at length in the night-time, it turned about to the north, which to&s;&s;ed us a little; &s;o that fearing wor&s;e weather, we re&s;olved to come to an anchor at <HI>Zia,</HI> being very near to it. <HI>Friday</HI> morning the Twelfth, we made a &s;ail, which coming nearer, we knew to be the Reer-Admiral of <HI>Venice,</HI> that was a Flemi&s;h bottom: When he had put out the Colours of St. <HI>Mark,</HI> we &s;hewed ours, and then he &s;aluted us with two Guns: We having returned the &s;alute, by firing five Petrera's, he gave us a &s;hot without a Bullet, to let us know he had a mind to &s;peak with us, and &s;o went to &s;tay for us at the Port of <HI>Zia,</HI> whither we followed him; we there found ano|ther Dutch Ship of the <HI>Venetian</HI> Fleet, both which were going with &s;uccours for <HI>Candie.</HI> It is a hundred and three&s;core miles from <HI>Cerigo</HI> to <HI>Zia,</HI> which has a Harbour &s;ecure from all Winds, the entry into it being at the We&s;t North-we&s;t &s;ide. <HI>Saturday</HI> the Thirteenth of <HI>November,</HI> we went to the Town, which is about five miles from the Port, with a de&s;ign to buy fre&s;h provi&s;ions there; we armed our &s;elves for fear of &s;ome ambu&s;h, which is a common thing in that Country; and we were told that a few days before, a Turki&s;h Galliot came in the night-time to the Harbour, and having &s;een &s;hips in it, went and skulked behind a Rock; the Turks in the mean time having landed, put them|&s;elves in ambu&s;h, and &s;urpri&s;ed tho&s;e of the other Ve&s;&s;els, who were come on &s;hore to walk and fi&s;h; among&s;t whom was a Captain of a &s;hip, being unarmed as the re&s;t were, and carryed them all off in view of the &s;hips, which could give them no aid. Having then prepared our &s;elves again&s;t the wor&s;t, we took a way that we thought to be the &s;horte&s;t, to the Town, but which was indeed the wor&s;t way and furthe&s;t about: We were forced, to clamber up and down three or four Hills that were &s;o high and rugged, being nothing but Rocks full of Ru&s;hes, that our hands were as well employed as our feet: At length, after a great deal of trouble, we came to the place, but when we thought of nothing, but of making merry there a little, we &s;aw three &s;hips out at Sea, which having advanced to the mouth of the Port, and finding that there were Ve&s;&s;els in it, &s;tood away, as if they intended to put into Port, at <HI>Spina Longa,</HI> an I&s;land towards <HI>Ne|gropont:</HI> This put our Captain into a great perplexity, who not knowing what to think of them, told us, that if any mi&s;chance happened to his Ve&s;&s;el, he would be pre&s;ent there him&s;elf: That, made us pre&s;ently return back again by the good way, which the Inhabitants &s;hew'd us; and, becau&s;e we &s;aw no more of the&s;e Ships, we concluded they mu&s;t belong to <HI>Malta,</HI> and that they would not put into the Port, becau&s;e they had &s;een Venetian Ships there, which made them believe, there could be no great &s;tore of fre&s;h Provi&s;ions left for them. <HI>Monday</HI> the Fifteenth, the Con&s;ul having given us a vi&s;it on Board our Ship, took us with them to the Town, and entertained us in his hou&s;e at Dinner: It is a great Town, containing at lea&s;t &s;even hundred hou&s;es; but they told us there was not above four hundred of them inhabited, and that the other three hundred, had been abandoned &s;ince the War of <HI>Candia:</HI> The&s;e hou&s;es are only built of &s;tones of the Rock and Earth, and are ranked like the Benches of

an Amphitheater, being all built one at the back of the roof of another, upon the &s;ide of the hill, and in that manner making ten or twelve ranks, &s;o that there are no other &s;treets but the roofs of hou&s;es, which are flat and joyn to one another, in&s;omuch that at one view one may &s;ee all the hou&s;es of the Town. There is a Ca&s;tle there, of a great height, which though now it be ruinous, was neverthele&s;s &s;o &s;trong, that as I was told, &s;ome years ago, Three&s;core Turks held it out a whole month, with two Mu&s;quets only, again&s;t the Venetian Army, under the Command of General <HI>Thomas Moro&s;ini,</HI> and yielded not till they came to want water. This I&s;land which in ancient times was called <HI>Ceos</HI> and <HI>Cea,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ceos.

The Women are Apparelled in a fa&s;hion that &s;eems to be rude and clowni&s;h, but which becomes tall women very well: They have coats that reach down to their knees, and of them &s;ix or &s;even one over ano|ther, which make them look very bigg, their &s;mock appearing half a foot lower; they wear white cloth &s;tockins, and on their head, a kind of veil that al&s;o covers their Brea&s;ts, which they turn as they plea&s;e: After all, the Inha|bitants of this I&s;land are good people, and de&s;erve to be pitied, becau&s;e of the mi&s;eries they &s;uffer both from Chri&s;tians and Turks.</P>

<P><HI>T&V;e&s;day,</HI> the Sixtenth of <HI>November,</HI> the wind being a little abated, we put out about eight of the clock at night, hoping to find the wind fair at Sea; but <HI>Wedne&s;day</HI> morning the &s;eventeenth of <HI>November,</HI> it blew &s;o &s;trong a North Wind, that we were obliged to bear away to I&s;le of <HI>Andra,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">I&s;le of <HI>Andra.</HI></NOTE> where we came to an Anchor, at two in the afternoon. We found five Venetian &s;hips there; who &s;o &s;oon as they under&s;tood from us, that there was &s;ome &s;u&s;pition of a Plague in <HI>Malta;</HI> they di&s;charged us from having any communication with them or tho&s;e of the I&s;land: Though this prohibition hindred me from getting any knowledge of this I&s;le by my own means, yet I &s;hall here relate what I learnt of it from tho&s;e who have been upon it, as al&s;o from a manu&s;cript Relation that hath come into my hands &s;ince. The I&s;le of <HI>Andra,</HI> in ancient time <HI>Andros,</HI> is three&s;core miles from <HI>Zia,</HI> it is four&s;core miles in circuit, and is reckoned the mo&s;t fertile I&s;land of all the <HI>Archipelago,</HI> as indeed, it is &s;o in all things, e&s;pecially in Silk, wherein the Inhabitants, who are about &s;ix thou|&s;and &s;ouls, Trade at <HI>Chio,</HI> and other Places; with Backs, that are made in <HI>Andra,</HI> and make forty thou&s;and <HI>Pia&s;tres</HI> profit of it a year. It hath a Town near the Sea, which contains not above two hundred Hou&s;es; the Port of it is pretty good, and the South Wind blows a thwart it; there is an uninhabited Ca&s;tle &s;till to be &s;een, upon a little Rock in the Sea, hard by it. There are be&s;ides &s;ixty Villages, &s;cattered here and there in &s;everal places of the I&s;land, of which the mo&s;t con&s;iderable are <HI>Arni</HI> and <HI>Amolacos,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Arni. Amolacos.</NOTE> that are inhabited by the <HI>Arnantes</HI> or <HI>Albanians,</HI> to the number of twelve hundred &s;ouls, all of the <HI>Greek</HI> Church, and differing in Language and Cu&s;toms; a rude &s;ort of Peo|ple,

any without di&s;cipline. Near to the&s;e Villages, there is a Mona&s;try of an hundred Monks, called <HI>Tagia,</HI> built in form of a Fort; with a Church, very well adorned, though &s;mall, and &s;erved by the&s;e Monks, who live in extreme ignorance. They entertain Travellers all the while they &s;tay there; and, when they depart, they give them Provi&s;ions to carry them home to their own Countrey; for they have great Revenues. There are be&s;ides, &s;ix other little Mona&s;teries, with a few Religious in them. There is a great number of <HI>Greek</HI> Churches in the I&s;land, which are all under the government and di&s;cipline of a <HI>Greek</HI> Bi&s;hop. The <HI>Latins</HI> have al&s;o a Bi&s;hop there, who, on <HI>Corpus Chri&s;ti</HI>-day, carries the Holy Sacrament in Proce&s;&s;ion all over the Town; at which there is a great concour&s;e of People, both <HI>Greeks</HI> and <HI>Latins;</HI> and, when the Bi&s;hop pa&s;&s;es along the &s;treets, all the people pro&s;trate them&s;elves, &s;pread Carpets, Flowers, Herbs, and other odoriferous things; and lye &s;o thick upon the ground, that the Bi&s;hop cannot pa&s;s without treading upon them: The Cathedral of the Bi&s;hop of the <HI>Latin</HI> Church, is dedicated to the Apo&s;tle St. <HI>Andrew;</HI> it is pretty neat, but hath no great Revenue. There are &s;ix Churches be&s;ides in the Town, of which there is one dedicated to St. <HI>Bernard,</HI> and held by the Capucines; who ea&s;e the Bi&s;hop very much, by their Preaching, hearing Confe&s;&s;ions, and by their School, to which all the <HI>Greek</HI> Children come; nay, &s;ome are &s;ent thither from <HI>Athens</HI> to learn. The Turks have the di&s;po&s;al of the Temporal Affairs, and there are &s;everal Families of them upon the I&s;land, who are very unea&s;ie Neighbours to the <HI>Greeks</HI> and <HI>Latins.</HI> There is a very plea&s;ant Valley in this I&s;land, called by the Inhabitants <HI>Menites,</HI> with plenty of fre&s;h Springs and Fruit-trees in it; be&s;ides about forty Mills, that grind Corn for the People of the Town and circumjacent Villages, which is very commodious: The Water which drives the&s;e Mills, comes from a Spring in a Church, called <HI>Madonna del cumulo;</HI> and this Water runs in Brooks, through the Valley; and under Trees, fallen of them&s;elves, &s;o that they &s;eem to have been bent &s;o artificially; and, indeed, a Painter cannot repre&s;ent a more lovely and plea&s;ant Valley in Landskip. In the Plain, at the end of this Valley, the Je&s;uites have a Garden, full of Fruit-trees of all &s;orts, which render them a con&s;iderable Revenue yearly: There they have their Hou&s;e, and their Church, called St. <HI>Veneranda.</HI> This I&s;land might be called very lovely, if the Hou&s;es of it were better built, and the Air good, but it is very bad, and &s;o is the Water of the Town. The Inhabitants of the I&s;le of <HI>Andra</HI> are civil, and their Language is more literal than the Language of the other <HI>Greeks;</HI> their Women are Cha&s;t, and &s;peak well, but their Aparrel is very unbecoming. The Inhabitants of the Town are not very laborious, love good chear and di|ver&s;ions, but the Pea&s;ants are more indu&s;trious; they make very white wicker Baskets, which are u&s;ed all over the <HI>Archipelago:</HI> As to their Food, they eat &s;ome|times Goats fle&s;h, though in the Woods and Hills they have good Veni&s;on and wild Fowl, as Hares, Coneys, Partridges, and the like; but they have neither Hunt&s;men nor Fowling-pieces: Their Sea affords no Fi&s;h, and is, as to that, wor&s;e than the Sea of <HI>Genoa.</HI> They have neither Phy&s;ician nor Chyrurgeon, but, when they fall &s;ick, betake them&s;elves to the Mercy of God. This I&s;le belonged heretofore to the Family of the <HI>Sanuti,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Family of <HI>Sa|nuti.</HI></NOTE> who had it in Dowry from the Family of <HI>Zen,</HI> of which were the Dukes of <HI>Naxia</HI> in tho&s;e times. It was into this I&s;land that <HI>Themi&s;tocles</HI> was &s;ent from <HI>Athens,</HI> to rai&s;e money; who, having entered into conference with tho&s;e of the I&s;land, told them, <HI>Gentlemen of</HI> Andra's, <HI>I bring you two Gods, the One of Per&s;wa&s;ion, and the Other of Force; chu&s;e you which of the two you plea&s;e:</HI> To which they an&s;wered, <HI>And we will pre|&s;ent you with two Godde&s;&s;es, the One Poverty, and the Other Impo&s;&s;ibility; take which of the two you plea&s;e:</HI> Which was the cau&s;e that the <HI>Athenians</HI> be&s;ieged and took it. We lay at an anchor before <HI>Andra,</HI> from <HI>Wedne&s;day</HI> the Seventh, till <HI>Fri|day</HI> the Nineteenth of <HI>November,</HI> when the la&s;t Quarter of the Moon began, which made us hope that the Wind would change: It being then a Calm, about Moon-ri&s;ing we weighed, betwixt, Ten and Eleven a clock at night, and found a good South-we&s;t Wind. When we were got out to Sea, we bore away to the &s;tarboard, and pa&s;s'd betwixt <HI>Andra</HI> and <HI>Negropont,</HI> with a Wind in Poop.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sciro. I&s;picera.

but we &s;till continued our cour&s;e with good enough &s;ucce&s;s, until next morning, <HI>November</HI> the One and Twentieth, when about Three or four a clock, we made Land, but knew not whether or not it was <HI>Tenedo;</HI> and about break of day we tacked, and then found that we were pa&s;s'd it; for we were before <HI>Troy,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Ships running a ground.</NOTE> and very near Land. Our Ship &s;tuck a ground, with the noi&s;e of which, our Cap|tain awoke; and thinking the Ship to be lo&s;t, he pre&s;ently &s;ent to view the Pump, to &s;ee if &s;he had made much water; but they found none at all: At the &s;ame time, he launched the Boat, and going into it, viewed the Snip all round, and found that &s;he had received no damage, her head having only &s;truck upon the &s;and: He thereupon ordered all the Sails to be furled, and the Ship beginning to float again, he cau&s;ed an Anchor to be heaved out a &s;tern, by means whereof, in a &s;hort time, we weighed off of the &s;and. We had certainly the particular a&s;&s;i&s;tance of God Almighty at that time, for it blowing &s;o fre&s;h, and we having all our Sails abroad, the Ship in all probability &s;hould have &s;tranded; and neverthele&s;s, in an hours time, we were got off, without &s;pringing the lea&s;t leak: But if the ground had been very Rocky, as it was but a kind of Oaze, the Ship had certainly been lo&s;t. Whil&s;t the Seamen were bu&s;ie in clearing the Ship, &s;eeing my &s;elf out of danger of &s;hipwreck, I con&s;i|dered the Ruins of that ancient and famous City of <HI>Troy,</HI> which are &s;till very remarkable, and of great extent. Being at length got clear, we &s;tood a little more off to the larboard, and betwixt Nine and Ten of the clock,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Chanel of the <HI>Helle&s;|pont.</HI></NOTE> we pa&s;&s;ed the Mouths, and entered the Chanel of the <HI>Helle&s;pont.</HI> It was at this place, where the Turks fir&s;t pa&s;&s;ed from <HI>A&s;ia</HI> into <HI>Europe.</HI> At One a clock, the Wind calming, we came to an Anchor. <HI>Monday,</HI> the two and twentieth of <HI>Novem|ber,</HI> a South Wind blowing, much about the &s;ame hour in the Afternoon, we weighed Anchor, and &s;oon after pa&s;s'd betwixt the Ca&s;tles of the <HI>Dardanels</HI> (which we &s;aluted with three <HI>Petrera's</HI>) and about Three in the Afternoon, we came to an Anchor.</P>

<P>ALL who have &s;een <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> agree in this, That it is the be&s;t &s;ituated City in the World; &s;o that it would &s;eem to be de&s;ign'd by Nature, for bearing Rule and Command over the whole Earth: It lies in <HI>Europe,</HI> upon a point of the main Land, jutting out towards the <HI>Bo&s;phorus</HI> of <HI>Thrace,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Bo&s;phoros</HI> of <HI>Thrace.</HI></NOTE> from which it is but half an hours pa&s;&s;age over to <HI>A&s;ia.</HI> On the right-hand, it hath the White Sea or <HI>Propontis,</HI> by which there is ea&s;ie pa&s;&s;age into <HI>A&s;ia,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The White Sea.</NOTE> <HI>Aegypt</HI> and <HI>Africa;</HI> and whereby it is &s;upplied with all the Commodities of tho&s;e Places.

Euxin Sea. <HI>Palus Meotis.</HI></NOTE> and the <HI>Palus Maeotis,</HI> which recieving a va&s;t number of Rivers, and having many bordering People, furni&s;h this City with all the Commodities of the North; in&s;omuch, that there is nothing that can be u&s;eful, nece&s;&s;ary or plea&s;ant, which is not brought in plenty from all hands to <HI>Con&s;tantinople</HI> by Sea;<NOTE PLACE="marg">The advan|tage of the oppo&s;ition of the Chanels of the White &amp; Black Seas.

Betwixt tho&s;e two Seas, is the Entry of the Port, which Nature, without the help of Art, hath made the lovelie&s;t of the World: It is at lea&s;t &s;ix miles in compa&s;s, a mile over, and deep in all places; &s;o that on both &s;ides one may &s;tep out of a Ship on &s;hore, without the help of any Boat, becau&s;e the bigge&s;t Ships may lay their head a-&s;hore without any danger. The Re&s;pon&s;e of the Oracle then, that was given to the Founders of it, is not to be wondred at, who (having con&s;ulted it to know where they &s;hould build their Town, received no other An&s;wer but this, <HI>Over again&s;t the blind Men;</HI> inti|mating unto them, that they &s;hould build over again&s;t the <HI>Chalcedonians;</HI> whom it reckoned to be very Blind, in having neglected a Situation &s;o advan|tagious by Nature, and built <HI>Chalcedon</HI> in <HI>A&s;ia,</HI> over again&s;t that place. This Town, heretofore called <HI>Byzantium,</HI> was built by <HI>Pau&s;anias,</HI> King of <HI>Sparta;</HI> &s;ome &s;ay he only re-built it, or enlarged it at mo&s;t: It was de&s;troyed by the Emperour <HI>Severus,</HI> to puni&s;h the Inhabitants for their Revolting; and afterwards re&s;tored by <HI>Con&s;tantine</HI> the Great, who (making it much bigger) called it <HI>New Rome;</HI> and afterwards (from his own Name) <HI>Con&s;tantinople.</HI> It was al&s;o called <HI>Parthenopolis,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Parthenopolis</NOTE> becau&s;e it was dedicated to the Ble&s;&s;ed <HI>Virgin</HI> by the &s;ame <HI>Con&s;tantine,</HI> perhaps in Imitation of <HI>Antioch,</HI> which was called <HI>Theopolis:</HI> After the Divi&s;ion of the Empire,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Theopolis.</NOTE> it continued to be the Seat of the Ea&s;tern Empire.

The Turks have ever &s;ince kept it, calling it <HI>I&s;tambol,</HI> which is a word corrupted from the Greek <GAP DESC="foreign">. It lies almo&s;t in the &s;ame Climate as <HI>Lions</HI> does, and neverthele&s;s the heat in Summer would be very incommodious there, if the Air were not cooled by a Breeze that commonly blows in the Afternoon, during the Months of <HI>July</HI> and <HI>Augu&s;t;</HI> the <HI>French</HI> call that Wind the Breeze from without, becau&s;e it comes from the mouth of the Port. This Town is &s;o &s;ubject to Earthquakes, that I have felt two in one night: As to its figure, it is triangular, two &s;ides of it are beat by the Sea,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Plain of <HI>Con&s;tantinople.</HI></NOTE> the one by the <HI>Propontis</HI> or White Sea, and the other by the Port; the third is towards the land; and the bigge&s;t of the three, is that which lies on the <HI>Propontis,</HI> and reaches from the <HI>Seraglio</HI> to the &s;even Towers; that towards the Port, is the middlemo&s;t. The <HI>Seraglio</HI> is built upon the point of the Triangle,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Situati|on of the <HI>Se|raglio.</HI></NOTE> which runs out betwixt the <HI>Propontis</HI> and the Port, and in a lower place under this Palace upon the &s;hore, are the Gardens of the <HI>Seraglio,</HI> much about the place where the ancient Town of <HI>Byzantium</HI> &s;tood, which afford a very lovely Pro&s;pect to tho&s;e who

come to <HI>Con&s;tantinople</HI> either by the White Sea, or the Black. On the other Angle,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The &s;even Towers.</NOTE> which is upon the Chanel of the White Sea, are the &s;even Towers co|vered with Lead; they were built by the Chri&s;tians, and &s;erved a long time for keeping the <HI>Grand Seignior</HI>'s Trea&s;ure; at pre&s;ent they are made a Pri&s;on for Per&s;ons of Quality. At the third Angle, which is at the bottom of the Port, on the Land &s;ide, are the Ruines of <HI>Con&s;tantine</HI>'s Palace. This Town is encompa&s;&s;ed with good Walls,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Walls of <HI>Con&s;tantinople.</HI></NOTE> which to the Land &s;ide are double; in &s;ome places built of Free-&s;tone, and in others of rough Stones and Brick. Each of the&s;e Walls has a broad flat-bottom'd Ditch, wharfed and faced on both &s;ides. The fir&s;t Out-wall is but a <HI>Fal&s;ebray,</HI> about ten foot high, with many little Battlements and Ca&s;ements in its Parapet; and Gun-holes below, a&s;wel in the Courtine as in the Towers, which are but at a little di&s;tance from one another, and about two hundred and fifty in number. The &s;econd Wall is of the &s;ame fa&s;hion, but higher, for it is at lea&s;t three fathom from the ground up to the <HI>Cordon,</HI> or edging; it has the &s;ame number of Towers as the former, but higher; &s;o that one Tower commands the other, which is as a Cavalier to it: In &s;hort, this might be made a very &s;trong Town; but as yet the Turks have had no need of it, for they have not been pur&s;ued &s;o far. The Walls on the Sea-&s;ide are not &s;o high, but they are &s;till good, and fortified but with the Ments and Turrets; they run along the &s;ides of the water upon the Streight of the <HI>Propontis,</HI> unle&s;s it be at the Creeks and Stairs, which are little Harbours where Boats put a &s;hore; for there they turn inwards, about fifty paces, to make place for them, according to the turnings of the &s;hore.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The bigne&s;s of <HI>Con&s;tantino|ple.</HI></NOTE>Many have imagined that <HI>Con&s;tantinople</HI> was bigger than either <HI>Caire</HI> or <HI>Paris,</HI> but they are mi&s;taken; for certainly it is le&s;s than either of tho&s;e two Cities. Some allow it thirteen miles in circuit, others &s;ixteen, and others again eighteen; but I went round it once with another <HI>Frenchman;</HI> we had each of us a Watch, and having taken a <HI>Caique</HI> or Boat at <HI>Tophano,</HI> we went over to <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> and landed as near as we dur&s;t to the <HI>Kionsk</HI> of the <HI>Seraglio,</HI> which is upon the Port; having then &s;ent the Boat to &s;tay for us at the &s;even Towers, we &s;et our Watches to Seven of the clock, and walked a-foot along the Port, without the Walls; and al&s;o along the Land-&s;ide, till we came to the &s;even Towers; where looking on our Watches, we found them both at three quarers after Eight; &s;o that we &s;pent an hour and three quarters in performing that Journey; and it requires no more than an hour to come by Water from the &s;even Towers to the <HI>Seraglio</HI> in a Boat with three Oars; for that Way cannot be gone on foot, becau&s;e the Water wa&s;hes the Walls; but if there were a foot-Way, I make no doubt but one may walk it in an hour or little more, and in an hour and a quarter at mo&s;t, with ea&s;e; and indeed, that quarter is to be allowed, becau&s;e in the beginning we left behind us a little of the &s;ide that is on the Port, &s;eeing no body dares to walk there. Thus I found, that in the &s;pace of three hours, at mo&s;t, one might make the circuit of <HI>Con&s;tantinople</HI> on foot, walking a pace, as we did. It may be &s;aid,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The circuit of the Walls.</NOTE> that without the Walls it is twelve miles in compa&s;s. This Town hath two and twenty Gates, &s;ix towards the Land, eleven along the Port, and five on the Streight of the <HI>Propontis,</HI> having all their landing Places and Stairs.</P>

<P>WHen <HI>Con&s;tantine</HI> the Emperour removed the Seat of his Empire, from <HI>Rome</HI> to <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> he re&s;olved to render that City, which he called <HI>New-Rome,</HI> &s;o illu&s;trious, that it &s;hould at lea&s;t be equal to old <HI>Rome,</HI> and for that end he cho&s;e &s;even little Hills, on the top and &s;ides whereof, in imitation of the
<PB N="21" REF="30">
fir&s;t, which is built upon &s;even Hills, he built his Town, which in progre&s;s of time he enrich'd with many ornaments, as Statues, Pillars, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> This Town, which &s;tands on &s;even little hills, is di&s;po&s;ed in &s;uch order, that one hou&s;e takes not away the &s;ight from another; the &s;treets are not fair, but are for the mo&s;t part narrow, though there be &s;everal goodly Buildings in them. There are many &s;tately Mo&s;ques in it, of which the mo&s;t magnificent is the <HI>Santa Sophia,</HI> heretofore a Chri&s;tian Church, built by the Emperour <HI>Ju&s;tin,</HI> enlarg'd, enrich'd and adorned, by <HI>Ju&s;tinian</HI> the Emperour, and dedicated to the Wi&s;dom of God, wherefore it was called <HI>Agia Sophia:</HI> The Turks becoming &s;ince ma&s;ters of <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> have changed it into a Mo&s;que, leaving it the name which it retains at pre&s;ent. This Fabrick which is admired by all that &s;ee it, is an hundred and fourteen paces in length, and four&s;core in breadth; it is &s;quare on the out&s;ide, and round within: There are four Gates to enter under the <HI>Portico,</HI> which reaches along the whole front of the Church, but there is only a little door left open, which is the wicket of a great Gate of well wrought Marble; Afterwards you find &s;even doors to enter into a kind of <HI>Nef</HI> or body of a Church, which is not very broad; and then nine other great brazen Gates: The middlemo&s;t whereof particularly, is very great; and by it they enter into the Mo&s;que, which is very &s;pacious, and hath a Dome in the middle, the arch whereof is made in form of a &s;quatted half Globe, and &s;o almo&s;t &s;ingular in its kind and architecture. In the in&s;ide of this Church, there is a porch that ranges all round, which carries another Gallerie, in like manner vaulted over, thirty paces btoad, &s;upported by &s;ixty Pillars, and this carried as many more le&s;&s;er ones, which uphold the top of the Church, all the&s;e Pillars being ranked by tens, as well above as below. The A&s;cent to the higher Gallery, is by a very ea&s;ie &s;tairca&s;e, and it behoved us to give a Turk money to open the door of it. This gallery, when the Chri&s;tians were ma&s;ters of it, was appointed for the women, who kept there, in time of Divine Wor&s;hip, that by the &s;ight of them the Devotion of the men might not be di&s;turbed:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Con&s;tantine</HI>'s Tomb.</NOTE> There is a Tomb to be &s;een there, which the Turks &s;ay, is the Tomb of <HI>Con&s;tantine,</HI> and a &s;tone al&s;o, upon which (as they believe) our Lady wa&s;hed our Lords Linnen, and they bear great reverence to it. Heretofore this Church was painted all over,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Stone re|verenced.</NOTE> after the Mo&s;aical way, and &s;ome pieces of it are &s;till to be &s;een, as Cro&s;&s;es and Images, which the Turks did not half deface, when they endeavoured to rub them out; for they &s;uffer no Images: On the out&s;ide of this Church,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Minarets.</NOTE> there are four <HI>Mina|rets</HI> or Steeples, very high and &s;lender; yet one may go up to the top of them; they have &s;everal &s;tories of Balconies, all round them, from whence the <HI>Muezins</HI> call to prayers. This Church, with the appurtenances of it, was heretetofore much bigger than it is at pre&s;ent; the Turks having cut off a great deal from it; and it has &s;erved them for a pattern to build their Mo&s;ques by: Clo&s;e by the back of this Church, in a litte &s;treet, not far from its entry, are two large and thick Pillars, where they &s;ay, Ju&s;tice was heretofore admini&s;tred; others &s;ay, that there were three of them, and that upon each <HI>Con&s;tantine</HI> cau&s;ed a bra|zen Cro&s;s to be erected, and that upon every Cro&s;s one of the&s;e words, <HI>Je&s;us, Chri&s;t, Surmounts,</HI> was engraven in large Greek Characters. Near to that place, there is an old Tower, where the Grand Signior's Bea&s;ts are kept; there I &s;aw Lyons, Wolves, Foxes, Leopards, a &s;potted Lynx,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Loup-cervier.</NOTE> the skin of a <HI>Giraffe</HI> and other rare Animals. <HI>Santa Sophia,</HI> being the Model for all the fair Mo&s;ques of <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> wherein there are &s;even Royal ones, that of <HI>Solymania,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Solymania.</NOTE> is very like to it; it is a great Mo&s;que full of Lamps, at the end of which there is a little Chappel or <HI>Turbe,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Solyman</HI>'s Cof|fin.</NOTE> and in it the Coffin that holds the body of <HI>Sultan Solyman</HI> the Founder of that Mo&s;que; this Coffin &s;tands upon a Carpet &s;pread upon the ground, which was brought from <HI>Medina,</HI> and over it there is a Pall brought from <HI>Mecha,</HI> which Town is repre&s;ented upon the Pall. At one end of the Coffin there is Turban, to which are fa&s;tened two Herons tops, enrich'd with precious &s;tones, and about it are many Tapers and Lamps, burning, with &s;everal Alcorans chained, that they may not be &s;toln, and that people may read them for the &s;alvation of the defuncts Soul, and indeed, there are men there at all times reading the Alcoran, who are hired to do it; for the Grand Signiors take care to leave a fund, for continual Prayers, to be &s;aid for them, after their death.

This Tower is built upon a Rock in the Sea, and is pretty &s;trong; there are &s;everal great Guns mounted in it, which may batter the Port of <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> and the two mouths of the <HI>Bo&s;phorus</HI> of <HI>Thrace</HI> and of the <HI>Propontis,</HI> or, as they &s;ay, of the Black and White Seas; there is a Well of excellent good fre&s;h Water in this Tower, but I cannot tell why they call it <HI>Leander</HI>'s Tower. From thence you go to <HI>Scudaret,</HI> which is a Village in <HI>A&s;ia,</HI> upon the Sea-&s;ide, over again&s;t the <HI>Serraglio</HI> of <HI>Constantinople;</HI> where the <HI>Grand Signior</HI> hath a &s;ttately <HI>Serraglio,</HI> and very lovely Gardens. A little lower, on the &s;ame &s;ide, over again&s;t the &s;even Towers, &s;tands <HI>Chalcedon;</HI> a Town anciently Famous, and celebrated by the Fourth general Council that was held there; but, at pre&s;ent, it is no more but a pitiful Village. The Princes I&s;le, which is four hours going from <HI>Constanti|nople,</HI> is another Walk, where the Air is excellently good; though this I&s;le be not great, yet it is very plea&s;ant, and contains two little Towns of <HI>Greeks.</HI> The Chanel of the Black Sea is a rare place to take the Air upon; this is the <HI>Bo&s;phorus</HI> of <HI>Thrace,</HI> which coming from the Black Sea to <HI>Constantinople,</HI> enters into the <HI>Propontis,</HI> and mingles its Waters with the White Sea; at the broade&s;t place it is about a mile over, and is twelve miles in length. Going from <HI>Tophana</HI> towards this Chanel, you &s;ee to the left-hand, on the &s;ide of <HI>Europe,</HI> a great many lovely Hou&s;es and Gardens; when you have entered into the Chanel, you have on both &s;ides the mo&s;t charming and delightful Pro&s;pect in the World; nothing offering to your view but &s;tately Hou&s;es, and Gardens full of all &s;orts of excellent Fruits: Upon the &s;ide, in <HI>A&s;ia,</HI> I &s;aw a very pretty Ca&s;tle, where <HI>Sultan Ibrahim,</HI> the Father of <HI>Sultan Mahomet,</HI> who Reigns at pre&s;ent, was hid for the &s;pace of twenty years, to avoid the Death which <HI>Sultan Amurath</HI> put his other Brothers to. This Ca&s;tle is covered with many very high Trees, that hinder it from being &s;een, which is the rea&s;on (as tho&s;e who live there told us) that few come to &s;ee it. Along both the &s;hores, there are al&s;o a great many good Villages, where one may have what&s;oever is needful. They take in this Chanel great quantities of good Fi&s;h, of &s;everal &s;orts, e&s;pecially Sword-fi&s;h,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sword-fi&s;h.</NOTE> which are great, and &s;o called, becau&s;e on their Snout they have a long broad bone, like a Sword, or rather a Saw; there are many Dolphins to be &s;een there, which follow Boats, playing and leaping out of the Water. Six miles from <HI>Constantinople,</HI> there are two Forts on this Sea, the one in <HI>Europe,</HI> and the other in <HI>A&s;ia,</HI> which &s;erve for Pri&s;ons for Per&s;ons of qua|lity, and were built to put a &s;top to the <HI>Co&s;acks,</HI> who (were it not for that) would often come and make Booty, even in <HI>Constantinople,</HI> &s;eeing, notwith&s;tanding the&s;e Forts, they &s;ometimes give the alarm to that City: In three or four hours time one comes to the end of the Chanel or <HI>Bo&s;phorus</HI> of <HI>Thrace,</HI> where the Black Sea begins. In the middle of this mouth, which is very narrow, there is a little I&s;le, or rather Rock, di&s;tant on each hand from the main Land about fifty paces, where being come, you may go up to the top of it, and there &s;ee a Pillar of white Marble, which is called the Pillar of <HI>Pompey,</HI> becau&s;e (they
<PB N="29" REF="34">
&s;ay) it was rai&s;ed by <HI>Pompey</HI> in memory of his Victory, after that he had overcome <HI>Mithridates.</HI> Clo&s;e by this Rock, and round it, there are &s;everal others &s;cattered here and there in the Water, which many take to be the <HI>Cyanean</HI> I&s;les, or <HI>Symplegades.</HI> On the main Land of <HI>Europe</HI> &s;ide, over again&s;t the Rock of <HI>Pompey</HI>'s Pillar, there is a Village on the Water-&s;ide with a Tower, on the top whereof there is a Light, for the convenience of Ve&s;&s;els, that by mi&s;take they may not run foul of the Rocks and be ca&s;t away; for that's a very dangerous Sea, and many &s;hipwrecks are made in it every year; &s;o that the <HI>Greeks</HI> call it <HI>Maurothala&s;&s;a,</HI> that is to &s;ay, the Black Sea;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Maurothala&s;&s;a.</NOTE> not becau&s;e the Wa|ters of it are black, but becau&s;e Storms and Tempe&s;ts ri&s;e on it &s;o &s;uddenly, that they cau&s;e many lo&s;&s;es; and though the Weather be never &s;o fair, yet Ve&s;|&s;els are often &s;urpri&s;ed there in a moment; for be&s;ides that, this Sea is not very broad, there are &s;everal Currents in it cau&s;ed by the <HI>Danube, Boristhenes, Tanais,</HI> and many other &s;maller Rivers that di&s;charge their Waters into it, which occa&s;ion &s;o many Eddies, that many times Ve&s;&s;els are carried upon the Rocks, and there peri&s;h. The Antients called this Sea <HI>Pontus Euxinus,</HI> a Name that hath been changed and &s;oft'ned from that of <HI>Axinos,</HI> which in Latin &s;ignifies <HI>Inho&s;pitabilis,</HI> one that u&s;es his Gue&s;ts unkindly; as in <HI>Italy,</HI> the the City which was &s;ince called <HI>Malventum,</HI> was named <HI>Beneventum.</HI> If you go a-&s;hore on the &s;ide of <HI>Europe,</HI> you'll &s;ee a very fine Countrey, full of Gardens, and good Pa&s;ture Ground; and in this Countrey there are &s;everal Villages inhabited by <HI>Greeks:</HI> A little further up in the Countrey, on the &s;ame &s;ide, there are very lovely Aqueducts, that carry water to <HI>Constantinople.</HI></P>

<P>I Have given but a &s;hort account of all the places of <HI>Con&s;tantinople</HI> that I have &s;een, becau&s;e many others have treated largely of them: I &s;hall now &s;ay &s;omething of the Shape, Strength, Cloathing, Cu&s;toms and Manners of the Turks; according to what I could ob&s;erve and learn.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Shape of the Turks.</NOTE> The Turks are com|monly well &s;haped, having a well proportioned body, and are free from many defects which are more common in other Countries of <HI>Europe;</HI> for you &s;ee nei|ther Crooked nor Criples among&s;t them, and it is not without rea&s;on, that it is &s;aid, As &s;trong as a Turk; they being for the mo&s;t part robu&s;t and &s;trong. Their Habit is fit to make them &s;eem proper,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Turks Habit advan|tagious.</NOTE> and it covers defects far more ea&s;ily than the <HI>Canons</HI> or <HI>Pantaloons</HI> of <HI>France;</HI> next their skin, they wear a pair of Drawers, which &s;hut alike behind and before; their Shirt (which hath &s;leeves like our Womens Smocks, and is &s;lit in the &s;ame manner) comes over their Drawers; they have a <HI>Doliman</HI> above their Shirt,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Doliman.</NOTE> which is like a clo&s;e|bodied Ca&s;&s;ock, that reaches down to the heels, and hath &s;treight &s;leeves, ending in a little round flap that covers the back of their hands; the&s;e <HI>Dolimans</HI> are made of Stuff, Taffeta, Sattin, or other neat &s;triped Stuffs; and in Winter they have them quilted with Cotton; over the <HI>Doliman,</HI> they gird them&s;elves about the &s;mall of the wa&s;te with a Sa&s;h, that may &s;erve them for a Turban, when it is wreathed about the head; or with a leathern Belt two or three fingers broad, adorned with Gold or Silver Buckles.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cangiar.</NOTE> At their girdle they commonly wear two Daggers, which they call <HI>Cangiars,</HI> and are properly knives in a &s;heath; but the handles and Sheaths are garni&s;hed with Gold or Silver, and &s;ometimes with Precious-&s;tones; or el&s;e the handles are only of the Tooth of a Fi&s;h, which they e&s;teem incomparably more than Ivory, and &s;ell a pound of it

very dear. They carry two Handkerchiefs at their girdle, one on each &s;ide, and their Tobacco-pouch hangs al&s;o at it; their Pur&s;e being in their bo&s;om, as many things el&s;e are, to wit, their Papers and foul Handkerchiefs, for they u&s;e their bo&s;oms as we do our pockets.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Feredge.</NOTE> Over the <HI>Doliman</HI> they wear a <HI>Feredge,</HI> which is like our Night-gown, having very wide &s;leeves, and about as long as the arm, though they hang not always &s;o far down; this &s;erves them for a Cloak, and in the Winter-time they line it with rich Furrs, and &s;uch as are able,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Samour.</NOTE> willingly lay out four or five hundred <HI>Pia&s;tres</HI> for a Lining of Sables, which they call <HI>Samour.</HI> Their Stockins are of Cloth the length of the leg, the feet whereof are &s;ocks of yellow or red Leather, according to their quality, &s;ewed to the Stockins;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Me&s;tes.</NOTE> they call the&s;e Socks <HI>Mestes.</HI> Their Shoes are of the &s;ame colour, and made almo&s;t like Slippers, the heel is equal to the re&s;t of the &s;ole, only it is &s;hod with a piece of Iron made purpo&s;ely half-round, and the&s;e Shoes they call <HI>Paboutches.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Paboutches.</NOTE> Their head is covered with a crim&s;on Velvet Cap, without brims, gilded in the in-&s;ide, and round that, they wreath a white or red <HI>Turban:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Turban.</NOTE> This <HI>Turban</HI> is a &s;carf of Linnen or Silk &s;tuff, many Ells long, and the whole breadth of the &s;tuff, which they turn &s;everal times about their head, and they wreath it in many fa&s;hions; &s;o that the condition or qua|lity of the Man may be known by the way he wears the Turban, and other head-attire, whereof we &s;hall &s;peak hereafter: Some fa&s;hions of them are very dif|ficult to be made, and there are people who&s;e trade and profe&s;&s;ion is to make them up, as Dre&s;&s;ers are with us. As for the Kindred of <HI>Mahomet,</HI> whom they call <HI>Scherifs,</HI> they wear a green Turban, (the word <HI>Scherif</HI> &s;ignifies Noble) and none but tho&s;e of that Race dare take to them&s;elves this Title, or wear green on the head, there being no other way to di&s;tingui&s;h them but by their colour. The&s;e Blades (who have only an imaginary Nobility) are very nume|rous, and for the mo&s;t part Beggars, if you except &s;ome Princes which they have &s;till in &s;ome States of <HI>Arabia</HI> and <HI>Africa,</HI> of whom we &s;hall treat in ano|ther place. The&s;e <HI>Scherifs</HI> give it out, that they have this particular vertue in them&s;elves, That throw them into a fiery Furnace, they'll come out without any hurt. The Women of this Race, are al&s;o to be known by a piece of green &s;tuff which they have fa&s;tened to their Veil on the fore-part of their head. But to return to the Turks Apparel; I look upon it to be very commodious, and, indeed, it is the Habit mo&s;t generally u&s;ed in the World, if you except &s;ome Northern and We&s;tern Provinces.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Hair and Beards of the Turks.</NOTE> The Turks &s;have their heads, and think it &s;trange that the <HI>Francks</HI> &s;uffer their Hair to grow; for they &s;ay that the De|vil ne&s;tles in it; &s;o that they are not &s;ubject to that filth and na&s;tine&s;s which breed among our Hair, if we be not careful to comb it well: But they let their Beard and Mu&s;tachios grow, except tho&s;e who are brought up and have Offi|ces in the <HI>Serraglio;</HI> for none there but the <HI>Grand Signior,</HI> and the <HI>Bostangi Ba&s;ha,</HI> &s;uffer it to grow; and they have a great e&s;teem for a Man that hath a lovely Beard; it is a great affront to one to take him by the Beard, unle&s;s it be to ki&s;s him, as they often do; they &s;wear by their Beard, as al&s;o by the Head of their Father, of the <HI>Grand Signior,</HI> and &s;uch like Oaths. When they &s;alute one another,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Turki&s;h way of &s;alu|ting.</NOTE> they uncover not the head, and to do &s;o would be an affront; but only laying their hand upon the brea&s;t, and bowing a little, they &s;ay, <HI>Sela meon aleicom,</HI> which is a&s;much as to &s;ay, Peace be with you; and he that is &s;aluted, does the like, and an&s;wers, <HI>Aleicom e&s;&s;elam ve rahhmet vllah,</HI> which is to &s;ay, Peace be with you, and God's Mercy al&s;o; and &s;uch other Benedictions. In fine, that way of &s;aluting is very grave, and was, indeed, the ancient way of Salutation, as appears by Holy Scripture. The left hand is the more honourable with the Turks,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The more honourable &s;ide.</NOTE> becau&s;e it is the Sword-&s;ide; &s;o that he who is on the right-hand, has the Sword under the hand of him whom he would honour. When a Turk walks with a Chri&s;tian, he will not willingly give him the left hand; and it is very ea&s;ie to make them agree as to that point; for &s;eeing with us the right hand is the more honourable, both of them are in the place of honour.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. XXIII.</HI> Of <HI>Baths</HI> or <HI>Bagnios</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE Turks make great u&s;e of Bathing, both for keeping their bodies neat and clean, and for their healths &s;ake: For that purpo&s;e, they have many fair <HI>Bagnios</HI> in their Towns; and the &s;orrie&s;t Village that is,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Bagnios.</NOTE> has at lea&s;t a <HI>Bagnio;</HI> they are all made after the &s;ame fa&s;hion, and there is no difference, but that &s;ome are bigger, and more adorned with marble than others. I'll de&s;cribe that which is at <HI>Tophana,</HI> near to a fair Mo&s;que, as being one of the lovelie&s;t that I have &s;een. You enter into a large &s;quare Hall,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A De&s;cripti|on of Bagnios</NOTE> about twenty paces in length, and of a very high roof; all round this Hall there are <HI>Ma|stabez,</HI> or benches of &s;tone again&s;t the wall, above a fathom broad,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ma&s;tabez.</NOTE> and half as high, which are all covered with mats; &s;o &s;oon as you come, they &s;pread you out a large napkin (which they call <HI>Fouta</HI>) upon the &s;aid benches,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fouta.</NOTE> where you &s;it down, and lay your cloaths after you have &s;tript: In the middle of this Hall, there is a great Fountain, with a large Ba&s;on of marble, for wa&s;h|ing the Linnen that hath been u&s;ed; and when they are wa&s;hed, they are hung up to dry upon poles which are on high, all round the Hall, When you have &s;ate down upon the napkin which they have &s;pread for you, they bring you another to put before you, which you tie over your &s;hirt, before you pull it off, (le&s;t you &s;hould &s;how what ought not to be &s;een, which would be a great crime) that covers you behind and before, from the girdle down to the knees: Having pull'd off your &s;hirt, you put it with your cloaths in the napkin you &s;ate upon, leaving them there without fear that any body will touch them, for the Bagnios are places of liberty and &s;ecurity, as though they were &s;acred, and there is no cheat ever committed in them; for if any were, the Ma&s;ter of the Bagnio would be obliged to make good what was lo&s;t or embeziled. After you are &s;tript, you enter by a little door into a &s;mall room, &s;omewhat hot; and from thence, by another door, into the great Hall, which is very hot. All the&s;e Halls are made with Domes, having little gla&s;s windows to let in the light. This great hot Hall is of a Pentagone figure, each &s;ide being &s;uppor|ted by two Pillars of white marble; on each &s;ide there is a marble edging or ri&s;ing, about half a foot high; and in the middle of that, in the floor, about two foot from the wall, there is a little Ba&s;on of white marble, two foot broad, and over it a cock of warm water; and a hands breadth above this cock, another cock, for cold water, &s;o that you mingle them as you plea&s;e; then you take large copper Cups (which are alwaies ready for that u&s;e) and with them throw upon your&s;elf as much water as you have a mind. In this Hall al&s;o, there is a large &s;tone-Fat full of hot water, whereinto you may go if you plea&s;e; but that is not &s;afe, becau&s;e a great many Rogues, who have &s;eve|ral di&s;ea&s;es, go into it, though the water be often changed; but if you be &s;ure that no body has as yet been in it, you may wa&s;h your&s;elf there. So &s;oon as you enter into that great Hall, you &s;it down upon the flat floor, which is all of marble, heated by Furnaces underneath; then comes a Servant &s;tark naked, except tho&s;e parts which mode&s;ty requires to be covered, (the Servants of the Bagnio are always &s;o, that they may be in readine&s;s to wait upon tho&s;e that come) and making you lye out at length upon your back, he puts his knees upon your belly and brea&s;t, and embracing you very &s;treight, makes all the bones of your body, arms and legs, crack again, to &s;tretch and &s;often the &s;inews; then laying you upon your belly, he does the like on your back, treading upon it, &s;o that he often makes you ki&s;s the ground; after that, having &s;haved your chin, and under the arm-pits, he gives you a ra&s;or to &s;have your&s;elf every where el&s;e; and you go into one of the little chambers, that are made in the intervals betwixt the &s;ides, and being there, you take off your napkin and hang it upon the door, that &s;o every one that &s;ees it may know there is &s;ome body

within, which will hinder them from coming in, and there you may &s;have your|&s;elf at your lei&s;ure: If you be afraid that you may hurt your&s;elf with a Razor, they give you a bit of Pa&s;te,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The way of u&s;ing <HI>Ru&s;ma.</HI></NOTE> made of a certain mineral, called <HI>Ru&s;ma,</HI> beat into a powder, and with lime and water made up into a Pa&s;te, which they apply to the parts where they would have the hair fetcht off, and in le&s;s than half a quarter of an hour, all the hair falls off with the Pa&s;te, by throwing hot water upon it: They know when it is time to throw on water, by trying if the hair comes off with the Pa&s;te; for if it be left too long &s;ticking on the place, after it had eaten off the hair, it would corrode the fle&s;h. <HI>Ru&s;ma</HI> is a mineral like to the ru&s;t or dro&s;s of Iron;<NOTE PLACE="marg">What <HI>Ru&s;ma</HI> is.</NOTE> it is much in u&s;e in <HI>Turky,</HI> and &s;old in &s;o great quantities, that the Cu&s;tom of it yields the <HI>Grand Signior</HI> a con&s;i|derable Revenue. In <HI>Malta</HI> they u&s;e in&s;tead of <HI>Ru&s;ma, Orpiment,</HI> which they mingle with lime for the &s;ame u&s;e. Having taken off the hair, and put your napkin about you again, you return into the great Hall, where you &s;weat as long as you plea&s;e; then comes a Servant with a Pur&s;e of black Camlet, into which he puts his hand, and rubs your body &s;o hard all over, that he clears all the filth from your skin, yet without hurting you; then he takes a lock of Silk, with a bit of Soap in it, and therewith rubs and &s;oaps you all over; after which he throws a great deal of water upon your body, and wa&s;hes your head al&s;o (if you plea&s;e) with Soap: Having done &s;o, he goes and brings you a dry napkin, which you put about you in the place of the wet one; then you return into the Hall where you left your cloaths, where &s;itting down, he pours water upon your feet, to wa&s;h off the filth that you may have got in coming; and after that, he brings you hot and dry napkins, wherewith you rub and dry your skin; and when you cloaths are on again, and you have &s;een your|&s;elf in a Looking-gla&s;s that another holds to you, you have no more to do, but to pay and be gone. The common price of the <HI>Bagnio,</HI> is two A&s;pres to the Ma&s;ter; and they who would be well &s;erved, give as much to the Man. The&s;e Bagnios are very commodious, and I believe the frequent u&s;e they make of them, pre&s;erves them from many di&s;ea&s;es: The poore&s;t per|&s;on that is, Man or Woman, goes at lea&s;t once a week to the Bagnio. There are Bagnios, whither the Men go one day, and the Women another; others, whither the Men go in the morning, and the Women afternoon; and others again &s;olely for Women. When the Women are there, they are &s;erved by Women; and it is a capital crime for any Man, of what&s;oever religion or quality he be, to enter into the Bagnio where the Women are.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The mode&s;ty of the Turks.</NOTE> It is al&s;o a great crime, but puni&s;hable only by &s;hame, or &s;ome Ba&s;tonadoes at mo&s;t, to &s;how ones privy Parts, or to look upon another Per&s;on's.

They drink not commonly in time of meal, but when they have eaten, they ri&s;e and fill their bellies full of Water; then they give God Thanks by a <HI>Handillah,</HI> that is to &s;ay, God be prai&s;ed.

<P>The Turks are not for|bid to drink Wine.</P></NOTE> and though Wine &s;eems to be Prohibited by the <HI>Alcoran,</HI> yet the good-fellows &s;ay, that it is no more but an advice or council, and not a precept: However, they drink it not publickly, unle&s;s it be the Janizaries, and other De&s;peradoes, that &s;tand in awe of no Man; when they fall to drinking, they drink a great deal, and if they can have it for nothing, they'll drink till they fall a &s;leep again, if they be let alone; &s;aying, that it is no greater &s;in to drink ten quarts, than one cup full; they never mingle Water with it, and laugh at Chri&s;tians for doing &s;o, as a thing that &s;eems altogether ridiculous to them. In the Countrey, about <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> and all over the <HI>Archipelago,</HI> they have plenty of good Wine. They have be&s;ides another Liquor, which they call <HI>Boza,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Boza.</NOTE> made of Barley or Millet, and ta&s;ts &s;omewhat like our Beer, but not &s;o plea&s;antly; I ta&s;ted of it once, but found it to be very bad; and none but the meaner &s;ort of people drink it, becau&s;e it is very cheap. This Drink makes them drunk; but they have another, which they u&s;e very commonly; they call it <HI>Coffee,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Coffee.</NOTE> and drink of it all hours in the day. This Liquor is made of a Berry that we &s;hall mention hereafter. They roa&s;t or parch it in a Fire-&s;hovel, or &s;uch like iron in&s;trument, then they peel it, and beat it into powder; and when they have a mind to drink of it, they take a copper Pot, made purpo&s;ely, which they call <HI>Ibrick,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibrick.</NOTE> and having filled it with Water, make it boyl; when it boyls, they put in this Powder, to the proportion of a good &s;poonful for three Di&s;hes or Cups full of Water; and having let all boyl together, they &s;natch it quickly off of the fire, or &s;tir it, el&s;e it would run all over, for it ri&s;es very fa&s;t. Having thus boyl'd ten or twelve wambles, they pour it out into <HI>China</HI> Di&s;hes, which they &s;et upon a Trencher of painted Wood, and &s;o bring it to you &s;calding hot, and &s;o you mu&s;t drink it, but at &s;everal &s;ips, el&s;e it is not good. This Liquor is bitter and black, and has a kind of a burnt ta&s;te: They all drink it &s;ipping, for fear of &s;calding them&s;elves;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Coffee-bane.</NOTE> &s;o that being in a <HI>Coffee-hane</HI> (&s;o they call the place where they &s;ell it ready made) one hears a pretty plea&s;ant kind of &s;ippling mu&s;ick.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The virtues of <HI>Coffee.</HI></NOTE> This Liquor is good to hinder vapours from ri&s;ing up from the &s;tomach to the head, and by con&s;equence to cure the Head-ach; and for the &s;ame rea|&s;on it keeps one from &s;leeping. When Merchants have many Letters to write, and intend to do it in the night-time, in the Evening they take a di&s;h or two of Coffee: It is good al&s;o to comfort the Stomach, and helps Dige&s;tion. In &s;hort, in the Turks opinion, it is good again&s;t all Maladies; and certainly it hath, at lea&s;t, as much virtue as is attributed to <HI>Tea:</HI> As to its ta&s;te, by that time a man hath drank twice, he is accu&s;tomed to it, and finds it no longer unplea&s;ant: Some put Cloves to it, &s;ome Cardamom-&s;eed, called in Latine <HI>Cardamomum minus,</HI> which they call <HI>Cacoule;</HI> and others Sugar; but that mix|ture which renders it more agreeable to the palate, makes it le&s;s whol&s;om and u&s;eful. There is a great deal of it drank in the Turki&s;h Countries; for there is no Man, Rich nor Poor, who drinks not at lea&s;t two or three Di&s;hes of it a day; and it is one of the things which the Husband is obliged to provide his Wife with.

very much at <HI>Mancala,</HI> which is a Box about two foot long,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The play of <HI>Mancala.</HI></NOTE> and about half a foot broad, wherein there are &s;ix holes on each &s;ide, to wit, &s;ix in the Box, and &s;ix on the Cover that is fa&s;tened to the Box, and opens like a pair of Ta|bles; every one plays with &s;ix and thirty Shells, putting at the beginning &s;ix in every hole. But the mo&s;t u&s;ual Recreations of Soldiers,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Turks skilful at their Arms</NOTE> are Military Ex|erci&s;es, in which they are very expert; they &s;hoot at a mark very true with a Bow and Arrow, and in the City there are &s;everal Butts, where (for a little money) they &s;hoot. But they are very dextrous at the <HI>Zagaye,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The way of darting the <HI>Zagaye.</HI></NOTE> and it is a great plea&s;ure to &s;ee in a large place or open field, a great many of them on Hor&s;e-back, &s;ome running away, and others at full &s;peed following after with a <HI>Zagaye</HI> in hand: That <HI>Zagaye</HI> is commonly a &s;quare Baton, made of a Palm-tree branch, about three foot long, and two or three times thicker than one's thumb. When the Pur&s;uer is got pretty near him that he pur&s;ues, and as it were within the length of his &s;tick, he darts his <HI>Zagaye</HI> at his back &s;o dex|trou&s;ly with a turn of hand that doubles the force of it, that &s;ometimes the end of it makes very con&s;iderable wounds, and that often enough in the head too. I &s;aw a Man at <HI>Caire,</HI> who having received a wound on his head by a <HI>Zagaye,</HI> was fain to have a piece of his skull taken out. Now he that is before and pur&s;ued, looks behind as he flies, both that he may &s;toop with his head if there be occa&s;ion, and endeavour to catch hold of the <HI>Zagaye,</HI> and avoid the blow if he can; for which end he holds his hand ready behind him, and when he catches hold of the <HI>Zagaye</HI> (which happens pretty often) he turns and pur|&s;ues the other; &s;o that they pre&s;ently change their parts. They perform this Exerci&s;e often, as al&s;o that of &s;hooting at a mark with a Harquebu&s;e running. Thus you'l &s;ee many of them in a field, who having put an Earthen Pot or &s;ome &s;uch thing upon the ground, or a mark upon a wall, will run at full &s;peed, and when they are at a pretty good di&s;tance from the mark, fire the Piece with one hand at arms length. I have often &s;een, that in ten or twelve &s;hot, one or two have hit the mark; and if any <HI>Ba&s;ha</HI> or Per&s;on of quality be pre&s;ent, he'll give five or &s;ix A&s;pres to him that hath hit the mark. I think, that among their Diver&s;ions I may reckon Puppet-Shows;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Puppet Shows in <HI>Turky.</HI></NOTE> for though the Turks &s;uffer no Images among them, yet they have Puppets, which, indeed, play not publickly, but in private Hou&s;es; though, during the <HI>Ramadan,</HI> they go from Coffee-hou&s;e to Coffee-hou&s;e, and if they collect money enough, they play there; if not, they give back the money and go their way. Now they are commonly Jews that &s;how Puppet-Shows, and I never &s;aw any but them play; they play not as in <HI>France</HI> and other Countries of <HI>Europe,</HI> but place them&s;elves in a corner of a room, with a cloth hung before them; and in the upper part of that piece of Hangings, there is a hole or &s;quare window, about two foot every way, with a piece of thin white &s;tuff over it; behind this they light &s;everal Candles, and having with the &s;hadow of their hands repre&s;en|ted many Animals upon this cloth, they make u&s;e of little flat Figures, which they move &s;o dextrou&s;ly behind the cloth, that, in my opinion, it makes a pret|tier Show, than our way does; and in the mean time, they &s;ing &s;everal pretty Songs in the Turki&s;h and Per&s;ian Languages, but on mo&s;t na&s;ty &s;ubjects, being full of foul ob&s;cenities; and neverthele&s;s the Turks take great delight in &s;eeing of them; nay, I was one evening with a <HI>Renegado,</HI> who, after he had treated me at Supper, entertained me with a Puppet Show.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Turki&s;h Lan|guage.</NOTE>THe Turki&s;h Language is a primitive and original Language, that's to &s;ay, not derived from any of the Oriental or Occidental Tongues that we have any knowledge of; it is very grave, plea&s;ant and ea&s;ie to be learn'd, but not copious, and is wanting in many words, which it borrows from the Arabick and Per&s;ian, but with that &s;upply and ornament, it may be &s;aid to be very ample and rich.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sciences of the Turks.</NOTE> The Turks are not much addicted to Sciences; neverthe|le&s;s they have their Doctors of the Law, appointed for that purpo&s;e, who make it their &s;tudy to explain the Law in all the &s;en&s;es that can be given to it. There are &s;ome al&s;o who give them&s;elves to A&s;trology, and many to Poetry; wherein they &s;ucceed well enough and have very ingenuous Conceits in their Po+ems. The greate&s;t part of their Poems and &s;ongs are in the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Tongue, which they &s;ing, not mu&s;ically as we do, but with a certian tone, which though at fir&s;t it be not plea&s;ing, yet by cu&s;tom becomes agreeable enough to the ear. They have &s;everal In&s;truments of Mu&s;ick,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Turki&s;h Lute.</NOTE> the mo&s;t common is a little Lute with three &s;trings, on which they'll play a whole day and not put it out of tune; and they have the Flute al&s;o. Among the Turks there are a great many who pretend to fortune-telling,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Diviners among&s;t the Turks.</NOTE> and have very good luck at it. There you &s;ee in &s;everal corners of the &s;treets men &s;itting upon a Carpet on the ground, with a great many Books &s;pread round about them. Now their Divination is performed three manner of ways, the fir&s;t is commonly for the wars, though it be al&s;o performed for all &s;orts of things, as to know whether a man &s;hould un|dertake a voyage, buy &s;uch a commodity, or the like. They take four arrows and place them with their points again&s;t one another, giving them to be held by two per&s;ons: Then they lay a naked &s;word upon a cu&s;hion before them, and read a certain Chapter of the Alcoran; with that the arrows fight together for &s;ome time, and at length the one fall upon the other; if for in&s;tance the victorious have been named Chri&s;tians, (for two of them they call Turks, and the other two by the name of their enemy) it is a &s;ign that the Chri&s;tians will overcome,<NOTE PLACE="marg">What Doing the Book means.</NOTE> if otherwi&s;e, it denotes the contrary. They never go out to war, but they make that experiment fir&s;t, which they call <HI>Doing the Book,</HI> nor do they undertake a Journey or Voyage, or any thing el&s;e of Con&s;e|quence, (as I have already &s;aid) but they fir&s;t <HI>Do the Book,</HI> &s;aying if &s;uch arrows be victorious I'll do it, if they be overcome, I'll not do it. Since my return to <HI>Paris,</HI> having found a Frenchman, who had been of the Turki&s;h Religion, and afterward renouncing it, had made his e&s;cape into Chri&s;tendom, who pretended to know how to Do the Book, I was curious to &s;ee it; he made his arrows, which he gave to another and me to hold, then he put a naked &s;word upon the Table where the arrows were, calling two of them Chri&s;tians, and the other two Turks, and told me, that he would know whe|ther or not the Emperour &s;hould have Wars with the Turks; he took an Alco|ran and read over the whole Chapter, which relates to that, but though he told us that the arrows would fight together in &s;pight of us, hold them as fa&s;t as we could, yet they did not &s;o much as wag, he &s;aid it was becau&s;e we laughed; &s;o that we endeavoured to compo&s;e our &s;elves and look very &s;eriou&s;ly, and he began again three or four times, but &s;till no engagement; at which he was exceedingly &s;urpri&s;ed; for he &s;wore to us, that he had done it a thou&s;and times, nay even to give re&s;pon&s;es to Chri&s;tians, and that he had always &s;uc|ceeded in it;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Another way of Divination The third way of Divi|nation.</NOTE> I cannot tell whether it was that we wanted faith, or that he was no more Turk, but we laughed heartily at him.

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. XXXVI.</HI> Of what renders the Turks &V;nclean, and of their Ablutions.</HEAD>
<P>THE third Command of the Turks concerns Prayer,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ablutions of the Turks.</NOTE> but becau&s;e they never &s;ay their Prayers till fir&s;t they wa&s;h, we mu&s;t &s;ay &s;omewhat of their Ablutions. The Turks have two kinds of Ablutions, the one is called <HI>Gou&s;l,</HI> and is a general Wa&s;hing of the whole Body: The other is termed <HI>Abde&s;t,</HI> and is the Ablution they commonly make before they begin their Prayers;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of the <HI>Abde&s;t.</HI></NOTE> for they never go to Prayers till fir&s;t they have u&s;ed the <HI>Abde&s;t</HI> at lea&s;t, or both the <HI>Gou&s;l</HI> and <HI>Abde&s;t,</HI> if it be needful;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of the <HI>Gou&s;l.</HI></NOTE> wherefore there are com|monly near the Mo&s;ques, Baths for the <HI>Gou&s;l,</HI> and Fountains for the <HI>Abde&s;t.</HI> There is al&s;o an Ablution that they perform after that they have done their Needs, which is a kind of <HI>Abde&s;t,</HI> but they only wa&s;h their Hands. They are obliged to u&s;e the <HI>Gou&s;l,</HI> after they have lain with their Wives, or after No|cturnal Pollution, or when Urine, or any other unclean thing hath fallen up|on them; and therefore when they make Water, they &s;quat down like Wo|men, lea&s;t any drop of it &s;hould fall upon them or their Cloaths; for they think that that which pollutes their Bodies or Cloaths, pollutes al&s;o their Souls: as al&s;o by wa&s;hing the Body, they think they wa&s;h the Soul. After they have made Water, they rub the Yard again&s;t a Stone, to fetch off any thing that might remain and defile them by falling upon their Cloaths. When they do their Needs, they make not u&s;e of Paper (as I have &s;aid) but having ea&s;ed them|&s;elves, they make all clean with their Fingers, that they dip into Water, and then wa&s;h their Hands, which they never fail to do after they have done their Needs, nay, and after they have made Water too; wherefore there is always a Pot full of Water in their Hou&s;es of Office,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Neatne&s;s of the Turks.</NOTE> and they carry two Handker|chiefs at their girdle, to dry their Hands after they have wa&s;hed. This clean|line&s;s is in &s;o great repute with them, and they are &s;o fearful lea&s;t they &s;hould defile them&s;elves with their Excrements, that they take care that even their Sucking Children in Swadling Cloaths do not defile them&s;elves, and for that end they &s;wadle them not as we do,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Cradle af|ter the Tur|ki&s;h fa&s;hion.</NOTE> but put them into Cradles which have a Hole in the middle, much about the place where the Child's Buttocks lie, and leave always the Breech of it naked upon the Hole; to the end that when it does its Bu&s;ine&s;s, the Excrement may fall into a Pot ju&s;t under the hole of the Cradle; and for making of Water, they have little Pipe of Box-wood crooked at one end, and &s;haped like Tobacco-Pipes, the&s;e Pipes are three Inches long, and as big as ones Finger; &s;ome have the Boul or Hole at the great end round, and &s;erve for Boys, into which the Yard is put, and fa&s;tned with &s;ome &s;trings; the others are of an Oval bore at the great end, and &s;erve for the Girls, who have them tied to their Bellies, and the &s;mall end pa&s;&s;ing betwixt their Thighs, conveys the Urine by the hole of the Cradle into the Pot underneath without &s;poiling of any thing; and &s;o they &s;poil not &s;o much Linnen as Children in Chri&s;tendom do. Now to continue the order of their Ablutions, they are obliged to make the <HI>Abde&s;t</HI> immediately after Prayers, as they are to wa&s;h their Hands immediately after they have done their Needs, or handled any thing that's unclean; and if they be in a place where they cannot find Water, they may make u&s;e of Sand or Earth in &s;tead of Water, not only for the <HI>Abde&s;t,</HI> but the <HI>Gou&s;l</HI> al&s;o, and the wa&s;hing of the Hands, and that Ablution will be good: The <HI>Abde&s;t</HI> is performed in this manner, Fir&s;t,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The way of doing the <HI>Abde&s;t.</HI></NOTE> Turning the Face towards <HI>Me|cha,</HI> they wa&s;h their Hands three times, from the Fingers end to the Wri&s;t. Secondly, They wa&s;h the Mouth three times, and make clean their Teeth with a Bru&s;h. Thirdly, They wa&s;h the No&s;e three times, and &s;uck Water up out of their Hands into their No&s;trils. Fourthly, With their two Hands they throw Water three times upon the Face. Fifthly, They wa&s;h three times,
<PB N="48" REF="44">
their right Arm from the Wri&s;t to the Elbow, and then the left. Sixthly, They rub the Head with the Thumb and fir&s;t Finger of the right Hand, from the Brow to the Pole. Seventhly, With the &s;ame Finger and Thumb, they wa&s;h the Ears within and without. Eighthly, they wa&s;h the Feet three times, be|ginning at the Toes, and going no higher than the In&s;tep, and with the right Foot fir&s;t, and then the left: But if they have wa&s;hed their Feet in the Morn|ing before they put on their Stockins, they pull them not off again, but only wet the Hand, and then with the afore&s;aid Finger and Thumb wa&s;h over the <HI>Paboutches,</HI> from the Toes to the In&s;tep, beginning always with the right, and then the left, and do &s;o every time that it is nece&s;&s;ary, from Morning to Night, that is to &s;ay, they pull not off their Stockins all day long: But if their Stockins have a hole big enough for three Fingers, they ought to pull them off. They &s;ay that God commanded them to wa&s;h the Face but once, the Hands and Arms as often, to rub the Head, as has been mentioned before, and to wa&s;h the Feet up to the In&s;tep, God being unwilling to overcharge Man, but that <HI>Mahomet</HI> added the two other times, for fear they might neglect it. The difference which they put betwixt that time which God commanded, and the two times of <HI>Mahomet,</HI> is that they call the fir&s;t <HI>Fars,</HI> and tho&s;e of <HI>Mahomet, Sunnet.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Mahomet</HI> ordained then that they &s;hould wa&s;h their Hands three times from the Wri&s;t to the Fingers ends, that they &s;hould u&s;e a Bru&s;h to make clean their Teeth, that they &s;hould wa&s;h their Mouth three times, that they &s;hould throw Water three times upon their Face with their two Hands, that they &s;hould &s;pend no more time in making clean one part than another, but that they &s;hould make ha&s;te; that they &s;hould wa&s;h their Ears with the &s;ame Wa|ter wherewith they wa&s;hed the Head; having a firm re&s;olution to wa&s;h them|&s;elves, and &s;aying aloud, or to them&s;elves, I am re&s;olved to make my &s;elf clean: That they &s;hould begin at the right &s;ide, and with the Toes in wa&s;hing of the Feet, and the Fingers in wa&s;hing the Hands, and that whil&s;t they wa&s;h, they &s;hould &s;ay the&s;e words, <HI>Bis millah el azem, ve ellem doullillah allahdin i&s;lam.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Things un|lawful when they wa&s;h.</NOTE> That's to &s;ay, In the Name of the great God, and prai&s;e to God, the God of the Mu&s;ulman Faith.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Charity of the Turks.</NOTE>THE Turks Fourth Command is Charity, by that Command they are obliged to give yearly to the Poor, the fortieth part of their Goods; if they have poor Kindred, they ought to prefer them before others; if they have none, they &s;hould give their Charity to their poor Neighbours; and if they have no poor Neighbours, they give it to the fir&s;t they meet.

I will not &s;ay, that the Charity alone of the Rich hinders the beggary of the Turks, there are (in my opinion) other cau|&s;es; for mo&s;t part of the Turks have pay from the <HI>Grand Signior,</HI> they live at a cheap rate, and make good chear of a &s;mall matter; &s;o that a little <HI>Pilau,</HI> a bit of Meat, and a &s;mall portion of water, will make to them a con&s;iderable Fea&s;t:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Charitable Donations of the Turks.</NOTE> But after all, they perform great acts of charity; &s;ome in their life|time relieve the Poor with their Goods; and others at their death leave great E&s;tates for the founding of Ho&s;pitals, building of Bridges, <HI>Kervan&s;errais,</HI> or Inns for the Caravans, bringing Water to the High-ways, and &s;uch other pub|lick Works; nay, many of them &s;ee them done in their own life-time; others again at their death give their Slaves their liberty: They who can't be cha|ritable with their Pur&s;es, do good with their Hands, employing them&s;elves in

mending the High-ways, filling the Ci&s;terns that are there &s;tanding by the Wa|ters, when they are out, that they may &s;hew Travellers the Foard, and all this, for Gods &s;ake, refu&s;ing money when it is offered them; for they do it (as they &s;ay) for the &s;ake of God, and not for the &s;ake of Money. Their Charity ex|tends al&s;o even to Bea&s;ts and Birds,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The charity of the Turks toward Bea&s;ts</NOTE> and all Market-days there are a great many who go and buy Birds, which they pre&s;ently &s;et at liberty, &s;aying, that the Souls of the&s;e Birds will come at the Day of Judgment, and declare in the pre|&s;ence of God, the kindne&s;s that they have received from them; and, indeed, they cannot endure to &s;ee a Bea&s;t kept in pain; for when they kill their Pullets, they cut of their head at one blow; and if they &s;aw a man kill any after the French way, they would not forbear to cudgel him; nay, they reckon it cru|elty to kill a Lou&s;e or Flea with the nail, they do no more but give them one or two turns betwixt the finger and thumb, and then throw them away dead or alive. There are others, who at their death leave con&s;iderable Means for the feeding &s;o many Dogs or Cats &s;o many times a week, and give the money to Bakers or Butchers for performing that charity, which is faithfully and punctu|ally enough put in execution; and it is very plea&s;ant to &s;ee every day Men loaded with meat, go and call the Dogs and Cats of the Foundation, and being &s;urrounded with them, di&s;tribute it among them by commons. I could here give an hundred In&s;tances of the charity of the Turks towards Bea&s;ts;<NOTE PLACE="marg">An in&s;tance of the charity of the Turks toward Bea&s;ts</NOTE> I have &s;een them often practice &s;uch as to us would &s;eem very ridiculous: I have &s;een &s;everal Men in good garb, &s;top in a &s;treet, &s;tand round a Bitch that had newly puppied, and all go and gather &s;tones to make a little wall about her, le&s;t &s;ome heedle&s;s per&s;on might tread upon her; and many &s;uch like Examples; but it is not my de&s;ign to trouble the Reader with &s;uch trifles. In fine, <HI>Sultan Amurath,</HI> who in all appearance had no Religion, and who made &s;o &s;light a matter of the life of a man, that if a day pa&s;t wherein he had not put &s;ome body to death, he was out of humour; this cruel Prince (I &s;ay) was affected with that &s;uper&s;titious and be&s;tial compa&s;&s;ion; for &s;eeing a man one day &s;top at the corner of a &s;treet in <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> to dine on a piece of Bread and a bit of roa&s;t Meat, which he had bought hard by, and hold his Hor&s;e (that was loaded with Goods he had to &s;ell) by the bridle; he ordered the Hor&s;e to be unloaded, and the load put upon the Ma&s;ter's back, obliging him to continue &s;o all the while that the Hor&s;e was eating a mea&s;ure of Oats, which he cau&s;ed to be given him; and upbraided the Man for the cruelty towards his Hor&s;e, in that he al|lowed the bea&s;t no re&s;t, when he took it to him&s;elf.</P>
<P>The Fifth Command of the Turks is, To go to <HI>Mecha,</HI> and is the Command the wor&s;t obeyed of all, becau&s;e many are not able to perform that Pilgrimage for want of Money, and &s;everal others are hindred by their Affairs; neverthe|le&s;s, they labour &s;till as much as they can, to put them&s;elves in a condition of performing it &s;ome time or other; and many go thither yearly: But I &s;hall treat more amply of this Pilgrimage, when I come to di&s;cour&s;e of <HI>Aegypt.</HI></P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. XXXIX.</HI> Of things Prohibited in the Turki&s;h Religion.</HEAD>
<P>NExt to the five above-mentioned Commandments,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Figures pro|hibited a|mong the Turks.</NOTE> there are &s;ome things that are Prohibited to the Turks, which they cannot make u&s;e of with|out &s;in: And in the fir&s;t place Figures, the prohibition whereof they exactly ob&s;erve; for though they be great lovers of Clocks and Watches, they'l not take them, if you would give them them for nothing, if they have any Figures of Men, Women, or Bea&s;ts upon them; but they matter it not, if they be of Trees or Flowers. When they &s;ee any Figures, they are &s;o highly offended, that they cannot forbear to expre&s;s their anger. When I was in <HI>Aegypt,</HI> there
<PB N="52" REF="46">
was a Turk who came to me daily, to teach me the Language; and as often as he &s;aw &s;ome Figures of Wood, that had been taken out of the <HI>Mummies,</HI> which I had in my Chamber, he fell into a pa&s;&s;ion with me; and though I told him, that they had been made by the ancient <HI>Aegyptians,</HI> yet he opened full mouth again&s;t the Chri&s;tians, for (&s;aid he) it belongs to none but to God to make Figures, to which he gives a Soul; and all who make Figures would imitate God; but at the Day of Judgment, the&s;e Figures will come and demand their Souls from tho&s;e that have made them. I did but laugh both at his pa&s;&s;ion and bruti&s;h rea&s;oning, which is the Argument of all the Turks; but it puzles them hard, when one tells them, that if the&s;e Figures demand a Soul, it mu&s;t be by &s;peaking; and if they &s;peak, they have a Soul already, and &s;tand not in need of another. Being one day on board of an Engli&s;h Ship, I perceived that all the Figures that were carved upon her for ornament, had the no&s;es cut off, which I thought was great pity; and they told me, that that Ship having been one Summer in the <HI>Grand Signior</HI>'s Service, the Turks who were on board had cut off the no&s;es of all the&s;e Figures, &s;aying, That it is not &s;o great a &s;in, if the no&s;es be cut off. The Turks are prohibited by the <HI>Alcoran</HI> to lend Money upon U&s;ury,<NOTE PLACE="marg">U&s;ury prohi|bited to the Turks.</NOTE> and with them it is a very great &s;in, from which they are careful to ab|&s;tain: However, there are always &s;ome among them who make bargains that differ little from U&s;ury. For Example: They &s;ell Goods upon tru&s;t at a very high rate, and he whom they have tru&s;ted (without going out of the Ware-hou&s;e) &s;ells them back to them at a lower price; they pay him in ready money, and the other remains &s;till Debtor for &s;o much Goods, &s;old at &s;uch a price.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Unclean Meats among the Turks.</NOTE> It is likewi&s;e prohibited to them to eat of unclean Meats, which are the &s;ame that the Jews hold to be unclean; and Hogs fle&s;h is no le&s;s abhorred by the Turks than by the Jews, who are &s;o far from eating it, that they would not touch it for all the world; nay, their Shoema|kers dare not make u&s;e of Hogs bri&s;tles as ours do, which puts them to a deal of pains in &s;owing their Pabouches. In the &s;ame manner, they abhor Frogs, Tortoi&s;es, Snails, and other Creatures forbidden to the Jews, all which they do &s;o abominate, that a Turk will &s;ooner lo&s;e his life, than eat of them; and I never &s;aw but one Turk that would eat Hogs fle&s;h; as for Renegadoes, they'l eat of it with all their heart, when they can have it; but they are People of no Religion at all, or &s;uch as look for an opportunity of making their e&s;cape into Chri&s;tendom. They account Dogs al&s;o to be unclean, and if by chance a Dog rub upon them, they are unclean, and mu&s;t needs wa&s;h, and therefore they more carefully keep out of the way of a Dog that is running, than we avoid a run|ning Hor&s;e; and, indeed, they keep no Dogs in their hou&s;es, but leave them in the &s;treets, where they abide in their &s;everal quarters, and are &s;o acquain|ted with their &s;tation, that they never go out of the bounds of it; and if they went out of their own &s;treet into another, the Dogs of the other quarter would kill them, as Invaders; for there are a great many in all the &s;everal &s;treets, who will not &s;uffer &s;trange Dogs to enter their territories. In my time, there was one at <HI>Pera,</HI> which knew the <HI>Franks</HI> wonderfully well, and &s;o &s;oon as he &s;aw any, he followed him, fawning upon him as far as his precinct extended, for a little bread; and it was a common thing to throw him an A&s;pre to buy bread with, to which a Turki&s;h Baker (that lived there) was &s;o accu&s;tomed, that &s;o &s;oon as he &s;aw a <HI>Frank</HI> coming, he made ready a loaf. The Turks are great lovers of Cats,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Turks hate Dogs, and love Cats.</NOTE> having &s;ome always by them, becau&s;e (they &s;ay) <HI>Maho|met</HI> had one, which on a time falling a&s;leep on the &s;leeve of his Garments, and the hour of Prayer being come, he cho&s;e rather to cut off the &s;leeve of his Gar|ment, than to awaken his Cat; in that they &s;hew ill nature, hating the Dog, which is very faithful; and loving the Cat, which is a cruel creature, being of the nature of the Tygre, and hath but few good qualities.</P>

They pa&s;s before the Superiour, &s;alute him very humbly, and then making a leap, (as tho&s;e do that begin to Dance at a Ball, they fall a turning round with their naked feet, the left foot &s;erving for a Pivot or Spindle to turn upon, for they lift it not from the ground, but they rai&s;e the other, wherewith they turn &s;o dextrou&s;ly, that one will &s;ooner be a weary of looking on, than they of turning, though for the mo&s;t part, they be old Men, and have long Garments. This turning is performed to the &s;ound of Drums and Flutes. When they &s;top, the Superiour, who (during the Dance) &s;its with his Vicar at the feet of their Pulpits, ri&s;es up, then making two &s;teps, bows towards the South, and the <HI>Dervi&s;hes</HI> bowing al&s;o, pa&s;s before him, humbly &s;alute him, and begin again to turn, and that for four times, the la&s;t being the longe&s;t of all. They turn as fa&s;t as Windmills with the &s;tronge&s;t wind run, and always keeping time; and though their arms be &s;tretch|ed out, their eyes &s;ometimes &s;hut, and they follow one another at a pretty near di&s;tance, turning all round the Rails, yet they never touch one another, but when the Mu&s;ick cea&s;es, &s;top &s;hort where-ever they are, without making the lea&s;t fal&s;e &s;tep, no more than if they had not at all moved. The Authour of this Dance was one <HI>Hazreti Mewlana,</HI> a <HI>Dervi&s;h,</HI> who is reckoned a Saint among them.

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. XLI.</HI> Of the Marriage of the Turks.</HEAD>
<P>THE Turks may have three &s;orts of Wives,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Marriage of the Turks. The Turks may have &s;e|veral Wives. Different &s;orts of Mar|riages.</NOTE> for they may Marry lawful Wives, have Wives of <HI>Kebin,</HI> and their Slaves for Wives: But the fir&s;t they never &s;ee till they be married. When any one would marry after this fir&s;t manner, he agrees with the Parents of the Maid whom he would have, what Dowry he is to give her, that &s;he may be his Wife; and this agreement is made in pre&s;ence of the <HI>Cady</HI> and two Witne&s;&s;es; which <HI>Cady</HI> writes down the conditions of the Marriage, and what Dowry he is to give his Wife. As for the Woman, &s;he brings nothing with her but her Bundle, which on the Wedding-day &s;he di&s;plays in her Chamber for a Shew; but before the Cele|bration, the Bridegroom gets an <HI>Imam</HI> to ble&s;s his Marriage, The day being come, the Bride well mufled up, is led to the Bridegroom's hou&s;e, her bagage going before upon Hor&s;es or Camels; and there they fea&s;t and make merry, the Men with the Men, and the Women with the Women in an Ap|partment by them&s;elves; he re&s;t of the day is commonly &s;pent in Mu&s;ick and Puppet-Shows, the Women &s;ometimes, whom they call <HI>Tehinghene,</HI> men|tioned by me before, dancing and playing tricks before them. When they are thus married, if the Husband happen to die, the Wife takes her Dowry, and no more; and if the Wife die, leaving Children behind her, the&s;e Chil|dren may con&s;train the Father to give them the Mothers Dowry. Now Turks may marry four Wives in this manner, and divorce them when they plea&s;e;<NOTE PLACE="marg">The way of divorcing Wives among the Turks.</NOTE> which they do, by going before a <HI>Cady,</HI> and &s;aying, <HI>Alei talac be talati;</HI> which is to &s;ay, I part with her for three times. And if a Man divorce his Wife wrongfully he ought to give her her Dowry; but if he do it upon ju&s;t grounds, he is not obliged to give her any thing. When a Woman hath been Di|vorced, &s;he cannot Marry another Man, till her months be four times over; that is to &s;ay, until the fourth month after her divorce, that &s;he may know whether &s;he be with Child or not, and by whom, that &s;o there may be no confu&s;ion in Lineages; and if &s;he be with Child, he that would Di|vorce her, mu&s;t &s;tay till &s;he be brought to bed before he can do it, and is obliged to keep the Children. When a Man hath divorced his Wife, or if the Divorce hath even proceeded from her, he cannot, if he would, take her again, till fir&s;t &s;he hath been Married to another Man, and then he may take her back. For the Wives of <HI>Kebin,</HI> le&s;s Ceremony &s;erves; a Man goes to the <HI>Cady,</HI> tells him, that he takes &s;uch an one to Wife, to whom he promi&s;es to pay &s;o much if he divorce her; all this the <HI>Cady</HI> writes down, and gives the writing to the Man, who (after that) may keep the Wife as long as he plea&s;es, or &s;end her going when he thinks fit, paying her what he promi&s;ed, and main|taining the Children he hath had by her. They have as many of the&s;e Wives as they plea&s;e for their Slaves; &s;eeing they are ab&s;olute Ma&s;ters, they do with them what they plea&s;e, and have as many of them as they think fit; and the Children of all the&s;e Wives, are all alike lawful. After all, the Turks never Marry their Kin&s;women, if they be nearer than eight Generations inclu&s;ively.</P>

<P>IT will not be ami&s;s I think, having &s;poken of Marriage, to &s;ay &s;omewhat of the Women of <HI>Turky,</HI> of whom I have as yet &s;aid nothing. In <HI>Turky</HI> the Women are commonly Beautiful, &s;treight, and well &s;haped; they are very fair, for they &s;tir but little abroad, and when they do, they are Veiled. They add art to their natural Beauty, for they paint their Eye-brows and Eye-lids with a blacki&s;h colour,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Surmee.</NOTE> which they call <HI>Surmee,</HI> that being graceful with them. They al|&s;o paint their Nails with a redi&s;h Brown,<NOTE PLACE="marg">El hanna.</NOTE> colour call'd <HI>El hanna.</HI> They are very cleanly and neat;<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Appar|rel of the Turki&s;h Wo|men.</NOTE> for &s;eeing they go at lea&s;t twice a week to the Bath, they have neither hair nor diot upon their Bodies: they are cloathed almo&s;t like the Men; and in the fir&s;t place all of them as well as the Men, wear Drawers next their Skin, which come down to their heels, and are according to the Sea&s;on of Velvet, Cloath, Cloath of Gold, Sattin, or Stuff. Next they have their Smock, and over that a little quilted Wai&s;tcoat.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Giupon.</NOTE> which they call <HI>Giupon,</HI> then they put on their <HI>Doliman,</HI> which they gird with a Girdle, adorned with plates of Sil|ver gilt, or Gold &s;et with precious Stones, and to that they hang a little <HI>Cangi|ar.</HI> When they go abroad, they have a <HI>Feredge</HI> as well as the Men, the Sleeves whereof are &s;o long that nothing is to be &s;een but the ends of their Fingers, for they put their Arms into the Sleeves, and in the &s;treet hold one &s;ide of the <HI>Feredge</HI> lapped over the other before.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The head at|tire of the Women.</NOTE> Their Ho&s;e and Shoes are like the Mens, but their head attire is different, for they make a very long tre&s;s of their Hair, which hangs down behind to the &s;mall of their Back, and they who&s;e Hair is too &s;hort, put it up in a Ca&s;e that reaches down to the &s;mall of their Back, which is commonly of Sattin, or el&s;e they u&s;e an artificial <HI>Tre&s;s.</HI> Within doors they cover their head with a Cap of red cloth, much like our Night-caps, but much longer, with four Horns or points on the top; to the middle whereof they &s;titch a round of Pearles. They wear this Cap hanging all over one Ear, and they tye it below with a Handkerchief of fine &s;tuff, wrought with flowers of Gold and Silk, which makes them look Great. When they go abroad they pull of that Cap, and take one made of Guilt Pa&s;te-board; this Cap is pretty high, and broader above than below. Be&s;ides that when they are abroad in the &s;treets their head is muffled up in a Linnen Cloth, which covers their Fore-head down to the Eyes, and another going athwart their Face ju&s;t under the Eyes covers their No&s;e and Mouth, and is tied behind the head, nothing of all their Countenance but the Eyes being uncovered; and if they did but &s;hew their naked Hands, they would be look'd upon as Women of no Reputation; and therefore they let the &s;leeves of their Smocks and Ve&s;ts hang down and cover their hands; not but &s;ometimes when they are in a cor|ner of a Street where they think they are not perceived, they'll lift the Veil to &s;hew them&s;elves to &s;ome Friend or Young-man that plea&s;es them, but in that they hazard their Reputation, and <HI>Ba&s;tonadoes</HI> be&s;ides. Now the&s;e Wo|men are very haughty,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Turki&s;h Wo|men are hau|ghty.</NOTE> all of them generally will be clad in flowered &s;tuffs, though their Husbands can hardly get Bread; neverthele&s;s they are extreamly Lazy, &s;pending the whole day &s;itting on a <HI>Divan,</HI> and doing nothing at all, unle&s;s it be embroadering Flowers upon &s;ome Handkerchief; and &s;o &s;oon as the Hus|band gets a penny, it mu&s;t be laid out for purcha&s;ing a Woman-Slave.

This la&s;ts &s;everal days, and &s;ometimes at the years end, they'll begin again. Such as cannot or will not weep, hire Mourn|ing Women, who gain a good deal of money thereby. At length, after all the&s;e Lamentations, comes the Ceremony that is to be ob&s;erved before the Decea&s;ed be put in the Grave; and his Relations and Friends having laid him out upon the Ground, wa&s;h his Body, and &s;have off his Hair; for the Turks love &s;o much to have their Bodies neat and clean, that they make even the Dead ob&s;erve it. Next they burn Incen&s;e about him, which they &s;ay &s;cares away Evil Spirits and Devils, who otherwi&s;e would mu&s;ter about the Body; then they wrap him up in a Sheet, praying God to be merciful unto him, but they &s;ew not up the &s;hroud at head and feet, to the end the Decea&s;ed may the more ea&s;ily kneel, when the Angels that are to examine him,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The colour of the Palls of the Dead.</NOTE> command him to do &s;o. They put him afterwards into a Coffin or Beer like to ours, which they co|ver with a <HI>Pall,</HI> that ought to be red, if he be a Soldier that is Dead; if it be a <HI>Scherif,</HI> it ought to be a green Pall, and if neither of the two, a black one, and a thwart over it they extend a <HI>Turban,</HI> according to the Office he

bore: If he was a <HI>Jani&s;ary,</HI> they put a red <HI>Turban,</HI> if a <HI>Spahi,</HI> a red one and a white, and if he be a <HI>Scherif,</HI> a green <HI>Turban;</HI> for others, they put a white one. He is after that carried to the Burying-place, then prie&s;ts going before, &s;aying certain prayers and often calling upon the name of God; after the Body, comes the Relations and Friends, then the Women, who altogether crie along the Streets like Mad-women, and holding a Handkerchief about their neck with both hands they pull it &s;ometimes this way, and &s;ometimes that way, as if they were out of their wits for Grief. In fine, being come to the Burying-place where the Corps is to de Interr'd, they take it out of the Coffin or Beer, put it into the Grave, and &s;o depart, leaving the Women there to make an end of their Mu&s;ick. If it be a Per&s;on of Quality, his Hor&s;es are led in &s;tate.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hor&s;es led at Funerals.</NOTE> Now the difference of the Turki&s;h Graves and tho&s;e of the Chri&s;tians of the Country in the in&s;ide, is this, that after the Turks have put their Dead into the Grave, they lay over a &s;loaping Board, one end of it being &s;et in the bot|tom of the Grave, and the other leaning on the upper end of the &s;ame above &s;o that it covers the Body, which the Chri&s;tians of the Country do not; but neither of the two Bury their Dead in Coffins.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The u&s;e of the Stone erected upon Graves.</NOTE> When the Grave is filled up, they erect a &s;tone over the head of the decea&s;ed, to &s;erve for a &s;eat to the Angels who are to examine him, that they may be the milder to him; but the Richer have Tombs of Marble rais'd as ours are, with a Stone, whereon the <HI>Turban</HI> of the De+cea&s;ed is cut. Somtimes they erect a Stone at the Head, with a <HI>Turban</HI> of Stone like to that the Decea&s;ed wore, and another at his Feet, with his Epitapth. Their Burying-places are always without the Town, that the Air might not be In|fected by the corrupt Vapours that ri&s;e out of the Graves; and that was always ob&s;erved by the Ancients. For the &s;ame rea&s;on tho&s;e of the Turks are di&s;tinct from tho&s;e of the Chri&s;tians; and the Turks Burying-places are commonly by the Highway &s;ides, that Travellers may remember to pray to God for them, and wi&s;h them happine&s;s: and upon the very &s;ame account, they who build a Bridge or any other publick work, are commonly Buried upon or near it, that they may have the Prayers of the Pa&s;&s;engers. There are &s;o many great Stones erected in &s;ome of the&s;e Burying-places, that they might &s;erve to build a Town. Now after they have Interred their dead, the Relations and Fri|ends for &s;everal days come and pray upon the Grave, be&s;eeching God to deliver the Decea&s;ed from the Torture of the Black Angels, and calling to him, bid him not be afraid, but an&s;wer them &s;toutly; and the Women al&s;o with their acquaintance, come and &s;pend &s;everal hours there, nay, &s;ometimes half a day in bewailing the Dead, as they did at home in the Hou&s;e; &s;o that a Man who were not informed of this, and &s;aw them in that po&s;ture, would make no doubt but they were Mad-women.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Victuals and Drink upon the Graves of the Dead.</NOTE> On <HI>Friday</HI> many bring Victuals and Drink, which they leave upon the Graves, and Travellers may freely eat and drink there.

<P>They are very Temperate, and commit no Exce&s;s,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Temperance of the Turks.</NOTE> neither in quantity nor quality of Victuals; Treating Hou&s;es would be very in&s;ignificant among&s;t them; and it may be &s;aid, that they Eat to Live, and Live not to Eat. This, I think, is mo&s;t part of the good that can be &s;aid of them.</P>
<P>Now for their Vices, they are Proud,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Pride of the Turks.</NOTE> e&s;teeming them&s;elves above all other Nations; they think them&s;elves the Valiante&s;t Men upon Earth, and that the World was only made for them. And indeed, they de&s;pi&s;e all other Nations in general, and e&s;pecially tho&s;e who are not of their Religion, as the Chri|&s;tians and Jews; and they commonly call Chri&s;tians Dogs: Nay,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Turks Super|&s;titious.</NOTE> there are &s;ome Turks &s;o Super&s;titious, that if when they come out of their Hou&s;es in the Morning, the fir&s;t Per&s;on they meet be a Chri&s;tian or Jew, they return quickly home again, &s;aying: <HI>Aouz billah min el &s;cheitan el redgim;</HI> that is to &s;ay, God pre&s;erve us from the Devil. The Rable think they do a brave action when they flout at, and jear a Chri&s;tian, e&s;pecially if he be a <HI>Frank;</HI> but that's be|cau&s;e our fa&s;hion of Apparel differing very much from theirs, they are much offended thereat, and call us Apes that have no Tails: But at <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> they are not very in&s;olent to the <HI>Franks,</HI> either becau&s;e of the great Com|merce they have with them, or rather becau&s;e they might ea&s;ily be got Puni&s;h|ed, if they did any hurt; however they &s;pare not now and then a blow with a Cudgel by the by, e&s;pecially if it be a Turk in drink. For my own part, I never met with any Trouble, only being one day with &s;ome other French in <HI>Con&s;tantinople</HI> without a Janizary, the Children threw &s;ome Cores of Apples at us; but &s;ome Trade&s;men coming out of their Shops, ran after them and di|&s;per&s;ed them. And indeed, when upon my leaving of <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> I went to take my leave of <HI>Monn&s;ieur de la Haye,</HI> the French Amba&s;&s;ador, he asked me if I had met with no Affront during the time that I had been there, and when I told him that I never had &s;o much as my Hat once &s;trucken off (which they often do, Hats offending their &s;ight) he told me, that I had had good luck, and that I might brag that I had come better off than any other ever had.</P>
<P>The Turks improve not Sciences much,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Turks Learning.</NOTE> and it is enough for them to learn to Read and Write; they often &s;tudy the <HI>Alcoran,</HI> which comprehends all

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Turks bea&s;tly in their Love.</NOTE>They are very Amorous, but with a bruti&s;h Love; for they are great So|domites, and that is a very ordinary Vice among&s;t them, which they care &s;o little to conceal, that their Songs are upon no other Subject, but upon that Infamous Love or Wine. They are very Covetous, and therefore their Friend&s;hip is ea&s;ily gained by Money, or Pre&s;ents; by means of Money one may receive all &s;orts of Civility from them, and there is nothing but what may be obtained at the <HI>Grand Signior</HI>'s Court for Money: Money makes Heads flie off, and in fine, Money is the great <HI>Tali&s;man</HI> there, as well as el&s;ewhere.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Prince of the Turks.</NOTE>THE Turks are all to &s;ubject to one &s;ole Prince, whom they call <HI>Sultan,</HI> and other Nations, the Emperour of the Turks, or the <HI>Grand Signior,</HI> be|cau&s;e of his great Power. This is an Hereditary Empire, and hath never gone out of the <HI>Ottoman</HI> Family, &s;ince fir&s;t it entred into it; that Race being held in &s;uch Veneration by the Turks, that they would do any thing rather than to &s;ubmit to an Emperour of another Line, in prejudice of the true Heirs.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Sultan Maho|met</HI> IV. his Age.</NOTE>The <HI>Grand Signior</HI> who Reigns at pre&s;ent, is called <HI>Sultan Mahomet</HI> the Fourth of that Name, Son to <HI>Sultan Ibrahim;</HI> in the Year 1655. that I was at <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> he was about Fifteen or Sixteen Years of Age: He &s;eem|ed to me to be of a low Stature, Tawny, and Melancholick. He hath a Scar on the left Cheek, which his Father made, who being on a time half Drunk,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Mahomet</HI> IV. wounded in in the Cheek by his Father <HI>Sultan Ibra|him.</HI></NOTE> fell a Dancing, and having commanded his Son to come and Dance with him, the little Boy made an&s;wer, I am not a fool to Dance: I am a Fool then (replied <HI>Sultan Ibrahim</HI> all in rage) and with that gave him a &s;tab with his <HI>Cangiar,</HI> or Dagger, in the left Cheek, and had Killed him, if his Wives had not prevented it. Others &s;ay, that it was by a Bottle he threw at him, he gave him that Scar.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Ceremo|ny of In&s;tal|ment of the <HI>Grand Signior.</HI></NOTE>When a <HI>Grand Signior</HI> dies then, his Son &s;ucceeds him, and if he have no Son, his Brother takes place, and pitches upon a day when he goes by Water to the <HI>Mo&s;que</HI> of <HI>Youp;</HI> which is at the bottom of the Port: This <HI>Mo&s;que</HI> hath a Cloi&s;ter, in the middle whereof, there is a Tribunal of Marble, rai&s;ed upon Marble Pillars. The <HI>Grand Signior</HI> mounting upon this Tribunal, the <HI>Mufty,</HI> after &s;ome Prayers, girds him with a Sword; and that being done, he makes his entry into <HI>Con&s;tantinople</HI> with <HI>Cavalcade.</HI> This Ceremony with them, is like the Coronation of our Kings; and he ends his <HI>Cavalcade</HI> at the <HI>Ser|raglio.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Brothers of the <HI>Grand Signior</HI> put to Death.</NOTE>No &s;ooner hath he taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Empire, but he bethinks him&s;elf of the means to make it durable, and for that end puts all his Brothers to Death, &s;till provided he him&s;elf have Male Children; for if he have none, it &s;eldom happens that he di&s;patches his Brothers, for fear of depriving the Empire of a Succe&s;&s;or of the &s;ame Race, and of putting an end to the <HI>Ottoman</HI> Family, which would be a very great &s;in. However <HI>Sultan Amurat</HI> did otherwi&s;e, for without any con&s;ideration of Race or Heirs, though he had no Children, he put to Death all his Brothers, except <HI>Sultan Ibrahim,</HI> the Father of <HI>Mahomet</HI> the pre&s;ent Emperour, who was &s;o well hid by his Mother, making the cruel Prince believe that his Brother was dead, that &s;he
<PB N="59" REF="50">
delivered him from his Rage. When, then, they have a mind to di&s;patch their Brothers, their Cu&s;tom is, to cau&s;e them to be Strangled with a Silken Halter, or Bow-&s;tring, making a &s;cruple of Con&s;cience to put them to death by the Sword, and &s;o to &s;hed the Imperial Blood. Be&s;ides, as I &s;aid before, Per&s;ons of Quality are &s;eldom Beheaded,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Per&s;ons of Quality are &s;trangled.</NOTE> but commonly Strangled when they are condemned to Die. If they put them not to Death, they are &s;hut up &s;o clo&s;e, that no Body can tell what is become of them; and whil&s;t I was at <HI>Con|&s;tantinople,</HI> I could not find any Man who could certainly inform me, whether the <HI>Grand Signior</HI> had any Brother alive or not.</P>
<P>The rea&s;on which obliges the <HI>Grand Signior</HI> to the&s;e Fratricides,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The cau&s;e of the Death of the Brothers of the <HI>Grand Signior.</HI></NOTE> is not only that he may have none to di&s;pute the Crown with him, but al&s;o that he may render him&s;elf Ma&s;ter of the Militia, who are &s;o In&s;olent, when any Brother of their Prince remains in being, that they daily importune the Emperour, de|manding extraordinary Large&s;&s;es, or Augmentations of their Pay; and if it be refu&s;ed them, they'll threaten and cry publickly, <HI>God pre&s;erve to us your Brother alive:</HI> Thereby intimating, that if he &s;atisfie them not, they can De|throne him, and put his Brother in his place. When that Pretext is taken from them, they reverence their Prince; but though that be a nece&s;&s;ary piece of Policy, yet it is very Inhumane.</P>
<P>When once the <HI>Grand Signior</HI> is well &s;ettled in his Throne,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Grand Signior</HI>'s Di|ver&s;ion.</NOTE> he minds no|thing but his Plea&s;ures, and many are employed upon that account. He hath always a great many Buffoons, who &s;tudy nothing el&s;e but to invent &s;ome piece of Folly that might give him Diver&s;ion. Girls have not the lea&s;t &s;hare in his Plea&s;ures; all the <HI>Ba&s;has</HI> make it their bu&s;ine&s;s to find out Beauties for him, &s;o that in a &s;hort time his <HI>Serraglio</HI> is well &s;tocked with the faire&s;t.</P>
<P>Many have written at large, how the <HI>Grand Signior</HI> &s;pends his time in the <HI>Serraglio,</HI> his daily Exerci&s;e, his way of Eating and Drinking, Bed, and the like, which are very hard to be known, there being no Witne&s;&s;es but Eunuches, who never come out of the <HI>Serraglio,</HI> and &s;ome <HI>Itchoglans:</HI> For my part, I know none of the&s;e particulars, more than the&s;e Gentlemen have mentioned, and therefore I &s;hall not &s;peak of them. I will only tell, what I had from an <HI>Itchoglan,</HI> newly come out of the <HI>Serraglio;</HI> that the <HI>Grand Signior</HI> is &s;erved at his Meals in <HI>China,</HI> which is more valuable then Purcelane or <HI>Terra Sigillata,</HI> that is reckoned to be good again&s;t Poy&s;on.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Grand Signior</HI>'s Di&s;hes.</NOTE> He hath al&s;o a great many co|vered di&s;hes of beaten Gold, each di&s;h with its cover, weighing twelve or thirteen Marks. The&s;e Di&s;hes were pre&s;ented to him by <HI>Kilidge Hali Ba&s;ha,</HI> a Renegado native of <HI>Me&s;&s;ina,</HI> after the Pillage and Robberies that he com|mitted in <HI>Calabria,</HI> where he took great Booty. Now though with them it be a &s;in to eat in Gold or Silver, yet he makes u&s;e of both; and the Queen Mother of the <HI>Grand Signior,</HI> is &s;erved in forty Silver plate di&s;hes. But at ex|traordinary Fea&s;ts, which are kept in the Gardens, or Summer-Hou&s;es, they are &s;erved in Ba&s;ons of Purcelane, or <HI>Terra Sigillata,</HI> as the Amba&s;&s;adours are al&s;o when they are fea&s;ted in the Hall of the <HI>Divan,</HI> before they have their Audience of the <HI>Grand Signior.</HI> When he eats he &s;peaks to no body,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Grand Signior</HI> never &s;peaks at Dinner.</NOTE> but makes him&s;elf be under&s;tood by Signs to the mute Buffoons, who are very ex|pert at that, having a very &s;ingular method in it; and there is nothing but what they can expre&s;s by Signs. The&s;e Buffoons are always playing &s;ome fool|i&s;h Tricks among&s;t them&s;elves to make him Laugh.</P>
<P>He never beats his Brains about Bu&s;ine&s;s,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Care of Af|fairs.</NOTE> but refers the whole management of Affairs to his Mini&s;ters, who give him a Summary Account of them, on certain days of the Week. Not but that there have been &s;ome who have taken the Care upon them&s;elves, ordering their Mini&s;ters to act according to their Directions. <HI>Sultan Amurat,</HI> though a very debauched Prince, always minded his Affairs, and <HI>Sultan Mahomet</HI> who Reigns at pre&s;ent, and traces the Foot&s;teps of his Uncle <HI>Amurat,</HI> loves Bu&s;ine&s;s very well too.</P>
<P>When the <HI>Grand Signior</HI> is weary of &s;taying in his <HI>Serraglio,</HI> he goes and takes the Air upon the Water, and &s;ometimes by Land, but not often, be|cau&s;e his Mini&s;ters do what they can to hinder him from that, lea&s;t Petitions may be pre&s;ented to the <HI>Grand Signior</HI> again&s;t them: For &s;uch as cannot have Ju&s;tice of them, expect till the <HI>Grand Signior</HI> be abroad in the Streets; and when he pa&s;&s;es by they put their Petition on the end of a Cane, which they
<PB N="60" REF="51">
hold up as high as they can; which the <HI>Grand Signior</HI> perceiving &s;ends for it, and has it brought to him. The truth is, the Mini&s;ters are not well plea&s;ed he &s;hould be informed of Affairs by any but them&s;elves.</P>
<P>I have &s;everal times &s;een the pre&s;ent <HI>Grand Signior</HI> abroad, but the fir&s;t time that I &s;aw him, I was told, that for at lea&s;t a Year before he had not been out of his <HI>Serraglio.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Grand Signior</HI>'s go|ing abroad out of the <HI>Serraglio.</HI></NOTE> When he goes abroad by Land, it is either with &s;mall Attendance, or in Pomp: I have &s;een both, as I &s;hall afterwards relate. When he goes by Water, he has always few Attendance; his Galiotte comes to the <HI>Kieusk</HI> of the <HI>Serraglio,</HI> which is on the Water-&s;ide over again&s;t <HI>Galata,</HI> and entring with a very &s;mall Retinue, he goes to <HI>Scudaret,</HI> or the Black-Sea, to take the Air. This is a mo&s;t rich Galiotte, guilt all over and adorned with many counterfeit Stones: It hath four and twenty Benches, that is to &s;ay, four and twenty Oars on each &s;ide,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Bo&s;tangis</HI> Rowers.</NOTE> each rowed by two <HI>Bo&s;tangis,</HI> who have only a Shirt over their Breeches, or rather Drawers; they have &s;carlet Caps &s;haped like a Sugar-Loaf, &s;uch as all the <HI>Bo&s;tangis</HI> wear, being half an Ell high; and they who &s;erve on this occa&s;ion are the Favorites of the <HI>Bo&s;tangi Ba&s;ha.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The advan|tage of the Rowers.</NOTE>Tho&s;e that Row on the right &s;ide are all the Sons of Chri&s;tians made Turks, who may ari&s;e to the dignity of <HI>Bo&s;tangi Ba&s;ha,</HI> to which Office tho&s;e that Row on the left hand, who are the Sons of Turks, and commonly of <HI>A&s;ia,</HI> can never a&s;pire: And the greate&s;t reward that they can hope for when they come out of the <HI>Serraglio,</HI> is to have four&s;core <HI>A&s;pres</HI> a day in Pay; whereas tho&s;e on the right &s;ide, after they have di&s;charged the Office of <HI>Bo&s;tangi Ba&s;ha,</HI> may be <HI>Agas</HI> of the <HI>Janizaries,</HI> nay, even <HI>Ba&s;has</HI> or Governours of Provinces. If any of the&s;e <HI>Bo&s;tangis</HI> chance to break an Oar in Rowing, the <HI>Grand Sig|nior</HI> gives him according to his Liberality, a handful of <HI>A&s;pres,</HI> or a handful of <HI>Chequins,</HI> as an encouragement for plying his Bu&s;ine&s;s with &s;o much &s;trength. In the time of <HI>Sultan Solyman,</HI> three <HI>Chequins</HI> was the ordinary reward, but at pre&s;ent it is not limited. However it is not by &s;trength, but rather &s;light that they break their Oars; and many times they break them half off before the <HI>Grand Signior</HI> come on board his Galiotte, and then ea&s;ily do the re&s;t as they Row. The <HI>Bo&s;tangi Ba&s;ha</HI> &s;its at the Helm and &s;teers the Galiotte, and at that time has opportunity enough to di&s;cour&s;e with the <HI>Grand Signior</HI> at his ea&s;e.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Grand Signior</HI> goes through the City in Di&s;|gui&s;e.</NOTE>Be&s;ides the&s;e ways of going Abroad, the <HI>Grand Signior</HI> goes &s;ometimes through the City in Di&s;gui&s;e, and without Attendance, as a private Man, to &s;ee if his Orders be punctually ob&s;erved: And he at pre&s;ent, who &s;eems in all his Actions to imitate his Uncle <HI>Sultan Amurat,</HI> went abroad almo&s;t every day in Di&s;gui&s;e, whil&s;t I was at <HI>Con&s;tantinople;</HI> having however &s;ome Men following him at a little di&s;tance, and among&s;t the re&s;t an Executioner. And by the way he cau&s;ed many Heads to flie off, both in <HI>Con&s;tantinople</HI> and <HI>Galata,</HI> which kept all things in better order. The Chri&s;tians were very glad that he Di&s;gui&s;ed him|&s;elf &s;o, for that was the cau&s;e that no body dur&s;t mole&s;t or abu&s;e them. Some|times he would go to a Bakers Shop and buy Bread, and &s;ometimes to a But|chers for a little Meat: And one day a Butcher offering to &s;ell him Meat above the rate which he had &s;et, he made a &s;ign to the Executioner, who pre&s;ently cut off the Butchers Head.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Prohibition of Tobacco.</NOTE> But it was chiefly for Tobacco, that he made ma|ny Heads to flie. He cau&s;ed two Men in one day to be Beheaded in the Streets of <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> becau&s;e they were &s;moaking Tobacco. He had prohibited it &s;ome days before, becau&s;e, as it was &s;aid, when he was pa&s;&s;ing along the Street where Turks were &s;moaking Tobacco, the &s;moak had got up into his No&s;e. But I rather think that it was in imitation of his Uncle <HI>Sultan Amurat,</HI> who did all he could to hinder it &s;o long as he lived. He cau&s;ed &s;ome to be Hanged with a Pipe through their No&s;e, others with Tobacco hanging about their Neck, and never pardoned any for that. I believe that the chief rea&s;on why <HI>Sultan Amurath</HI> prohibited Tobacco, was becau&s;e of the Fires, that do &s;o much mi&s;chief in <HI>Con&s;tantinople</HI> when they happen, which mo&s;t commonly are occa&s;ioned by People that fall a&s;leep with a Pipe in their Mouth, that &s;ets fire to the Bed, or any combu&s;tible matter, as I &s;aid before.</P>
<P>He u&s;ed all the arts he could to di&s;cover tho&s;e who &s;old Tobacco, and went to tho&s;e places where he was informed they did, where having offered &s;everal

<HI>Chequins</HI> for a pound of Tobacco, made great entreaty, and promi&s;ed &s;ecrecy, if they let him have it; he drew out a Cimeter under his Ve&s;t, and cut off the Shopkeepers Head. They tell a very plea&s;ant adventure of his upon this oc|ca&s;ion. Being one day in di&s;gui&s;e at <HI>Scudaret,</HI> he went into the Boat that pa&s;&s;es over to <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> wherein there were &s;everal People, and among&s;t others a <HI>Spahi</HI> of <HI>Anatolia,</HI> who was going to <HI>Con&s;tantinople</HI> for his Pay.<NOTE PLACE="marg">A &s;tory of <HI>Sultan Amurat</HI> upon the pro|hibition of Tobacco.</NOTE> No &s;ooner was this Blade come into the Boat, but he fell a &s;moaking; and no body dur&s;t &s;ay any thing to him &s;ave <HI>Sultan Amurat,</HI> who drawing near, asked him if he did not &s;tand in Awe of the <HI>Grand Signior</HI>'s Prohibition. The <HI>Spahi</HI> very arro|gantly made an&s;wer, That the <HI>Grand Signior</HI> led a brave life on't, that he de|lighted him&s;elf with his Women and Boys, and making him&s;elf Drunk in his <HI>Serraglio;</HI> that for his &s;hare all he had was Bread, that Tobacco was his Bread, and that the <HI>Grand Signior</HI> could not hinder him to &s;moak; and with that asked him if he would take a whiff. <HI>Sultan Amurat</HI> told him &s;oftly that he would; and having got the Pipe from the <HI>Spahi,</HI> went and hid him&s;elf in a corner of the Boat, &s;moaking with as much circum&s;pection, as if he had been afraid &s;ome body might &s;ee him. When they were come to <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> both together went into a <HI>Caique</HI> to go into <HI>Galata,</HI> each pretending to have Bu&s;ine&s;s there. When they were come a &s;hoar, <HI>Sultan Amurat</HI> invited the <HI>Spahi</HI> to go drink a cup of Wine in a place where he knew it was good; and the other conde&s;cended. The Emperour led him towards the place where his Servants &s;taied for him (for when they Di&s;gui&s;e them&s;elves, they appoint their Ser|vants to meet them at a certain place) and being pretty near, he thought, becau&s;e he was very &s;trong, that he was able alone to arre&s;t the Man, and therefore took him by the Collar. The <HI>Spahi</HI> much &s;urpri&s;ed at that boldne&s;s, and re|membring he had been told, that <HI>Sultan Amurat</HI> often di&s;gui&s;ed him&s;elf, he made no doubt but that it was he; &s;o that &s;eeing him&s;elf undone, he quickly took up his Mace that hung by his Girdle, and with it gave <HI>Sultan Amurat</HI> &s;uch a Blow over the &s;mall of the Back, that he beat him down, and then fled. <HI>Sultan Amurat</HI> being mad that he mi&s;&s;ed of his de&s;ign, cau&s;ed it to be Publi&s;hed, that he acknowledged the Fellow who had given him the Blow to be brave, and that if he did appear, he would greatly reward him; but the other mi&s;tru&s;ting his Promi&s;e, kept out of the way.

<P>THE <HI>Grand Signior</HI> (as I &s;aid before) meddles but little or not at all with Affairs, and if any apply them&s;elves to Bu&s;ine&s;s, it is only in mat|ters of great Con&s;equence. For if he concerned him&s;elf in &s;maller Affairs, he mu&s;t &s;hew him&s;elf too often, which he would take to be Prejudicial to him, and a Diminution of his Maje&s;ty.

very little time to him&s;elf; neverthele&s;s all ardently a&s;pire to that Dignity, though they be almo&s;t &s;ure to Die within a few days after.

But when he is on the way to go to it, his Enemies growing more powerful by his ab&s;ence, &s;o be&s;tir them&s;elves, that they obtain a Warrant for his Death; immediately thereupon, a <HI>Capidgi</HI> is &s;ent after him, who having overtaken him, &s;hews him the Order he has to carry back his Head; the other takes the <HI>Grand Signior</HI>'s Order, ki&s;&s;es it, puts it upon his Head in &s;ign of re&s;pect, and then having performed his Ablution and &s;aid his Prayers, freely gives up his Head: The <HI>Capidgi</HI> having Strangled him (or cau&s;ed Servants whom he brought purpo&s;ely with him to do it) cuts off his Head, and brings it to <HI>Con&s;tantinople.</HI> Thus they blindly obey the <HI>Grand Signior</HI>'s Order,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Great re&s;pect to the <HI>Grand Signior</HI>'s Or|ders.</NOTE> their Servants never offering to hinder the Executi|oner, though the&s;e <HI>Capidgis</HI> come very often with few, or no Attendents at all; for they think they make a happy end when they Die by Orders from the <HI>Grand Signior,</HI> believing them&s;elves to be as good Martyrs, as tho&s;e who die Fighting again&s;t the Enemies of their Religion. However now a days, there are a great many who are not &s;uch Fools, and I fancy, that of late they begin to be undeceived of that pretended Martyrdom;<NOTE PLACE="marg">The cau&s;e of the frequent Rebellions in <HI>A&s;ia.</HI></NOTE> for they receive not now &s;uch news with a &s;erene Countenance.

Neverthele&s;s the <HI>Grand Vi&s;ier</HI> that died la&s;t, di&s;charged that Office for many Years, and ended his days by a Na|tural Death.

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. XLVIII.</HI> Of the Oeconomy or regulation of Provi&s;ions among&s;t the Turks. Of the Money and Weights of <HI>Con|&s;tantinople.</HI></HEAD>
<P>IN all things the Turks are &s;o great lovers of Order, that they omit nothing that can tend to the ob&s;ervance of it; and becau&s;e oeconomy and the regu|lation of provi&s;ions, is one of the chief things that &s;erve to maintain it, they take a &s;pecial care of that; &s;o that all things are to be had in plenty, and at rea&s;onable rates: they never &s;ell Cherries or other Fruits there when fir&s;t they come in at the weight of Gold, as they do in this Country; things are &s;old there always at rea&s;onable rates; and he that hath taken the pains to bring his Fruit &s;oone&s;t to Market, has no more advantage but to take Money before others: if any one offered to exact upon a Turk in &s;elling of his Goods, he would be &s;oundly Drubbed, or el&s;e brought unto Ju&s;tice, and there be Con|demned to <HI>Ba&s;tonadoes,</HI> be&s;ides the payment of a Fine; and therefore there are Officers that take care to examine the weights of tho&s;e that &s;ell Goods, who daily go their rounds, and if they find any Man with weights that are too light, or that &s;ells his Goods too dear, they fail not upon the &s;pot to order him &s;o many blows with a Cudgel upon the Soles of the Feet, and be&s;ides make him pay a Fine: &s;o that being afraid of that puni&s;hment, they'll always give you &s;omewhat over and above the weight; and &s;o one may &s;end a Child to Market provided it can but ask for what it wants, for none dur&s;t cheat the Child; and &s;ometimes the Officers of the Market meeting it, will ask what it payed for &s;o much Goods, and weigh them, to &s;ee if the poor thing hath not been cheated, for if it be, they carry it along with them and puni&s;h the &s;eller. I &s;aw a Man who &s;old Snow at five <HI>Deniers</HI> the pound,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The puni&s;h|ment of &s;el|lers by fal&s;e Weights.</NOTE> receive Blows upon the Soles of his Feet, becau&s;e his weight was not exactly full. Another having &s;old a Child a <HI>Double</HI> worth of Onions, and the Officers of the Market meeting this Child, and finding that he had not enough, went to that Man, and gave him thirty Blows with a Cudgel. They have al&s;o another puni&s;hment for tho&s;e that &s;ell with fal&s;e Weights,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Another pun|i&s;hment for &s;uch as &s;ell by fal&s;e Weights.</NOTE> which &s;eems not to be &s;o har&s;h, but is more Ignominious, as being more publick; they put a mans neck into a Pillory made of two Boards, weighing an hundred pound weight, which he carries on his &s;houlders, and with the&s;e being hung full of little Bells, he marches up and down the Town, to be laughed at by all that &s;ee and know him. As to di&s;orders and quarrels that happen in the Streets, every one is obliged to hinder them; and that all may be the more concerned in that, there is a Law much received, that if any dead Per&s;on be found in the Streets, whether he be Chri&s;tian, Turk, or Jew, and it be not known who Killed him; they before who&s;e door the Dead Man is found, are
<PB N="67" REF="53">
made to pay for his Blood; and the &s;et rate for the Blood of a Man,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The price of a mans Blood that hath been kill'd be|fore any bo|dies door.</NOTE> is five hundred <HI>Pia&s;tres,</HI> or forty five thou&s;and <HI>A&s;pres;</HI> &s;o that it is the intere&s;t of every one to &s;ee that no noi&s;e be made before his Door, or at lea&s;t to ob&s;erve tho&s;e that make it: this is very exactly ob&s;erved in relation to the Turks, but the Chri&s;tians have many times partial Ju&s;tice done them. When I was at <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> a poor Greek meeting &s;ome Turks coming out of a Tavern in <HI>Galata,</HI> they asked him for &s;ome flowers that he had in his hand, and he having given to the one and denied the other, telling him he had no more; the Villain gave the poor Greek a &s;tab with a <HI>Cangiar</HI> in the Body, and &s;o fled. This having happened before the Convent of the <HI>Jacobins,</HI> the poor wretch was immediately carried into their court for relief, but he was hardly there before he Expired; which at the &s;ame time coming to the knowledge of the <HI>Vaivode</HI> or Bailiff of <HI>Galata,</HI> he &s;ent and demanded of the poor Religious, and of a French Merchant that lived overagain&s;t them, the Blood of that Man;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Vaivode.</NOTE> but (luckily for them) that <HI>Vaivode</HI> was Strangled four or five days after, before they had paid their Money; &s;o that they were quitted for the fear of it.

They give them on the &s;oles of the Feet in this manner: They have a great &s;tick, with two holes in it about the middle, a large foot and an half di&s;tant from one another, and through the&s;e two holes they put a cord: He who is to be Ba&s;tanado'd, lyes down upon the ground, and his feet are put between that cord and the &s;taff; then two men take the &s;taff by the two ends, and each of them al&s;o pull an end of the cord, that &s;o he may not &s;tir his feet, that are fa&s;t betwixt the cord and the &s;taff, which they hold up very high: In this po&s;ture he has no &s;trength to move, being only &s;upported by his &s;houlders; and then two other men, each with a &s;tick or &s;witch about the bigne&s;s of the little finger, beat upon the &s;oles of the wretch one after another, like Smiths &s;triking upon an Anvil, reckoning the blows aloud as fa&s;t as they lay them on, until they have given as many as have been ordained, or till he that hath power, &s;ay, It is enough.

The <HI>Grand Signior</HI> keeps always a &s;tanding Army, both in Peace and War, which con&s;i&s;ting of Hor&s;e and Foot, is punctually payed once in two months.

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. LI.</HI> Of the ea&s;ie way the <HI>Grand Signior</HI> has in rai&s;ing and maintaining great Armies.</HEAD>
<P>FRom what I &s;aid before, it plainly appears, that the <HI>Grand Signior</HI> may in a few days time rai&s;e an Army of two or three hundred thou&s;and Men; for when he intends to make War, he has no more to do, but to &s;end his Orders to all that receive his Pay; who &s;o &s;oon as they receive Command, fail not to make ready to do what they are enjoined; the&s;e amount already to a con&s;iderable number of Men; for a good part of the <HI>Grand Signior</HI>'s Subjects receive his Pay. Be&s;ides that, he &s;ends for the <HI>Ba&s;has,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Orders for rai&s;ing an Army. <HI>Ba&s;has.</HI></NOTE> or Governours of Places, to come to him; and the&s;e come in all ha&s;te with a great train of Servants, who are &s;o many Soldiers, and &s;ometimes bring along with them part of the Forces of their Government, if they have had orders. The <HI>Sangiacs</HI> come with their <HI>Timar Spahis,</HI> and many of the Troopers have Ser|vants, who are &s;o far from being a hindrance, (as they commonly are in the Armies of Chri&s;tendom) that they do very good &s;ervice. Now it is very ea&s;ie to make them march and &s;ub&s;i&s;t In the Fields, for they have but little Baggage,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The &s;ub&s;i|&s;tence of For|ces.</NOTE> and fear not fatigue. They can live upon a &s;mall matter; and provided they have Rice, a little Bread, Water, Coffee and Tobacco, they make as good chear as if they were at home; and if any of the&s;e things be wanting, they have patience, and are not in&s;tantly undone, as Chri&s;tians are, when they have no more Wine. Thus their Armies never peri&s;h with hunger, Victuals being brought them in &s;ufficient quantity from all hands; for &s;eeing they punctually pay for what they have, commit no di&s;order, nor plunder the Countrey, all things are brought to the Camp, as to a common Market: Nay, when the <HI>Turks</HI> are at War with the <HI>Per&s;ians,</HI> Merchants travel &s;ecurely from one Countrey, and from one Army to another, and trade without any apprehen&s;ion of being plundered. <HI>Sultan Amurat</HI> led to <HI>Bagdad</HI> an Army of &s;ix or &s;even hundred thou&s;and Men; others &s;ay, nine hundred thou&s;and Hor&s;e and Foot: It behoved him to march over De&s;arts, and neverthele&s;s he took &s;uch orders, that his Army &s;ub&s;i&s;ted very well. It co&s;ts the <HI>Grand Signior</HI> no more to maintain his Army in time of War, than in time of Peace; for he keeps none but his own Soldiers, and the <HI>Ba&s;has</HI> and others maintain tho&s;e whom they have brought with them; But it is not the Number alone that makes them gain &s;o many Battels, and take &s;o many Towns, it is al&s;o the Valour and Strength of the Soldiers, who being never weakned by fatigue, are always in a readine&s;s to fight again&s;t the Enemy, how fre&s;h &s;oever they may be; and when they are engaged, fight like Lyons, chu&s;ing rather to be cut in pieces, than to retreat, unle&s;s the Enemy far exceed them in number: But that which chiefly renders them &s;o couragious, is the great confidence they put in De&s;tiny; for they firmly believe, that if they be to die to day, they'l die a&s;wel in their Chamber, as in the Field; and that if their day be not come, a hundred thou|&s;and men cannot take their life away from them, becau&s;e it is &s;aid in the <HI>Alcoran,</HI> that a Man cannot die, till his time be come; that no Man can retard it, and much le&s;s prolong or &s;horten his life, but according as it is written in the
<PB N="72" REF="56">
Book; whereupon they have this Proverb, That what is written on a Man's Forehead, will certainly come to pa&s;s; for they &s;ay, that all Men have their de&s;tiny written upon their Forehead. This Belief makes them undauntedly expo&s;e them&s;elves to all &s;orts of dangers, and even to &s;light the Plague; &s;o that they are not at all afraid to come to and touch an infected Per&s;on, nor to put on their Cloaths as &s;oon as they are dead. They have be&s;ides another encou|ragement to be &s;tout, which is the zeal of their Religion; for they are very zealous, and will freely venture their lives for the defence or enlargement of it, believing that they die Martyrs, when they die fighting again&s;t the Enemies of their Law, and &s;hall after death enjoy the delights which <HI>Mahomet</HI> hath promi&s;ed them: Moreover they blindly obey the orders of their Commanders, and go on whither &s;oever they are &s;ent, never con&s;idering whether or not they &s;hall come off again; all the&s;e things together, makes them run headlong into the greate&s;t dangers of War, as chearfully as if they were going to a Fea&s;t. <HI>Sultan Amurat</HI> being before <HI>Bagdad</HI> with a numerous Army, and having &s;pent &s;ome days without any advantage over his Enemies; being mad that any thing could re&s;i&s;t him, and fearing that he &s;hould be forced &s;hamefully to rai&s;e the Siege,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Sultan Anu|rat</HI>'s harangue to his Army.</NOTE> a&s;&s;embled his whole army, and telling the Soldiers what di&s;grace it would be for them to draw off from thence without doing any thing, declared that he would rather peri&s;h there with them all, than return into his own Countrey with the &s;hame of having done nothing, commanded a general A&s;&s;ault to be given the next day, and a&s;&s;ured them, that all &s;uch as &s;hould return from the A&s;&s;ault before the Town was taken, &s;hould be put to death with his own hands. Next day the A&s;&s;ault was given, and &s;eeing all knew that <HI>Sultan Amurat</HI> was a Man of Execution, every one, both Soldiers and Officers, &s;trove who &s;hould fir&s;t offer their bodies to the Enemies blows; a va&s;t number were killed, but at length they took the Town by &s;torm. Be&s;ides the advantage of their Num|bers and Courage, they are likewi&s;e very well armed, and likewi&s;e very skilful in handling of them; for in that e&s;pecially they exceed the Chri&s;tians, that they place the chief part of their Wealth in the magnificence of their Habits,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Turki&s;h Sol|diers well armed.</NOTE> Hor&s;es, Arms and Harne&s;s, of what&s;oever quality they be; and if a wretched <HI>Janizary,</HI> who hath four or five A&s;pres a day, can &s;crape together fifty Crowns, he'l freely lay them out upon a good Musket or hand&s;om Sword. The&s;e Muskets are big, and of very good metal, and weigh &s;ometimes forty, fifty, nay &s;ixty pound weight; nay, I have &s;een one that weighed four&s;core: They put in them a great Charge of Powder, and then ram down a &s;izable Bullet with the Scowring-&s;tick,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The way of firing the Musket.</NOTE> which is all Iron; after that, they hold their Musket with the right Hand again&s;t the right Shoulder, and with the left Hand a leathern Belt fa&s;tened to a ring at the middle of the Musket, and to another near the Butt, and with that they'l &s;hoot as exact as one can do with a light Fowling-piece, and their Musket never &s;plit. I remember that a <HI>Janizary</HI> belonging to the <HI>French</HI> Con&s;ul at <HI>Caire,</HI> having on a time charged his Musket with a Bullet of &s;ize, and &s;hot at two Turtles upon a Tree, he &s;hot off the head of the one, and the other through the body. As for the Troopers (whatever &s;ome <HI>French</HI> men, who have been in tho&s;e Countries, may &s;ay) they &s;it a Hor&s;e well; they have, indeed, the Stirrops very &s;hort, but yet they look very well, and &s;it as clo&s;e as if they were nailed to the Hor&s;e. One day, in the <HI>French</HI> Quarter, I &s;aw a <HI>Spahi</HI> &s;o drunk, that he could not &s;tand; but when he was on Hor&s;e-back, he made an hundred Caracolles, without the lea&s;t reeling.

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. LIII.</HI> Of the Battel of the <HI>Dardanelles,</HI> Fought in the Year <HI>1656.</HI></HEAD>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Battel of the <HI>Dardanelles.</HI> in 1656.</NOTE>NEws being brought to <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> that the <HI>Venetian</HI> Fleet was before the <HI>Dadanelles,</HI> the Turks made ha&s;t to &s;et out theirs and engage them; and during that time an <HI>Italian</HI> who had had &s;ome command on Board of a Ship of the <HI>Venetian</HI> Fleet, being di&s;gu&s;ted by the other Officers, made his e&s;cape out of the Fleet,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A <HI>Venetian</HI> turns Turk.</NOTE> and came with his Son pre&s;ently to <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> where they both turned Turks: the Turks took that for a good Pre&s;age, and gave it out that he was a Chri&s;tian of great Quality that had turned Turk. He de&s;ired the command of a Ship, but they would not tru&s;t him &s;o much, only put him on Board the <HI>Ba&s;tarde.</HI> All things being in readine&s;s, the Turki&s;h Fleet parted from <HI>Con&s;tantinople</HI> on <HI>Saturday</HI> the &s;eventeenth of <HI>June,</HI> about ten a clock in the Morning; I was at that time in a Balcony of my Lodgings, from whence I had a view of all the Port,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The number of the Turki&s;h Ve&s;&s;els that were at the Battel of the <HI>Dardanelles,</HI> in 1656.</NOTE> and ea&s;ily reckoned all the Ve&s;&s;els as they went out. The Fleet con&s;i&s;ted of &s;ix and fifty Galleys, &s;even and twenty Gallions or Ships, nine <HI>Maones</HI> or Gallea&s;&s;es, and five Galliottes or <HI>Brigantins.</HI> I had with me a Turki&s;h <HI>Spahi,</HI> who by what art I cannot tell, gue&s;&s;ed very well at a great many things, as he had &s;everal times done to <HI>French</HI> Men in my pre&s;ence, to whom he told &s;uch things, as none but them&s;elves ought to know; when he &s;aw the Fleet go out, he looked into his Book and then told me that the Captain <HI>Ba&s;ha</HI> was much in the wrong to &s;et out before Noon, becau&s;e it was an unlucky day: It is probable that &s;omebody with the Captain <HI>Ba&s;ha</HI> told him as much, or that they <HI>Did the Book;</HI> becau&s;e they never undertake any thing of Importance, without <HI>Doing the Book,</HI> as they call it, with two Arrows, as I have &s;aid before: for being out of the great Port, they put into a little one, called <HI>Be&s;ikta&s;ch</HI> in <HI>Europe,</HI> about four miles below <HI>Galata,</HI> towards the <HI>Black-Sea,</HI> and &s;taid there till one of the clock. The fir&s;t day of the <HI>Ramadan,</HI> which was &s;ix or &s;even days after, the <HI>Mufti, Grand Vi&s;ier,</HI> and all the People went to pray for the pro&s;perity of the Fleet in the <HI>Ocmeidan,</HI> which is a great open place that I mentioned before; but their Prayers were not heard, for <HI>Thur&s;day</HI> evening the nine and twentieth of <HI>June,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">News of the Fight.</NOTE> news came to <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> that the two Fleets had engaged the &s;ix and twentieth, and that the Turki&s;h Fleet was Defeated. Some days after a French man of <HI>Provence</HI> and Renegado <HI>Jani&s;ary,</HI> who had been in the Fight, and got off, told me all the particulars, and the order of it very exactly;<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Frenchman began the Fight.</NOTE> according to his relation, and even according to what the Turks and all people confe&s;&s;ed, it was a Ship commanded by a French man carrying fourty Guns which began the play. When the two Fleets were drawn up over again&s;t one another, the Turks being near the <HI>Dardanelles,</HI> but without, this French Captain made all the Sail he could, and bore in upon the Turks with &s;o good way that the Galleys could not follow her. The Turks &s;eeing her &s;o far on head of the re&s;t of the Fleet, and all alone, thought at fir&s;t that &s;he was coming to joyne with them; but when the Captain was come within di&s;tance and poured in two Broad-&s;ides among them, &s;o that they &s;aw their Ve&s;&s;els &s;hattered and Arms and Legs flying about, they were &s;oon undecei|ved and all fell a Firing at him; the re&s;t of the Chri&s;tian Fleet followed, but he alone was fain to &s;tand by it, and received the great and &s;mall Shot of one half of the Turki&s;h Fleet, which he mawled &s;everely; for playing con|tinually both with great and &s;mall &s;hot, he di&s;abled a good part of their Fleet. At length the Turks doing what lay in their power to &s;ink this &s;hip, an un|lucky &s;hot from the <HI>Dardanelles</HI> carried away her Rudder; &s;o that the brave Captain finding his Ship to be now no more fit for Service, he put all his Men on board a Turki&s;h Ve&s;&s;ell that he had taken, and Burn'd his own, that the Turks might not be the better for her. In relating the Valour of this
<PB N="75" REF="57">
Captain, it is not my de&s;ign to le&s;&s;en the Glory of the re&s;t of the Fleet, all did wonderfully well; and the Galleys of <HI>Malta</HI> who were but &s;even, when they came, were fifteen, be&s;ides three Gallea&s;&s;es when they went back, having taken &s;even Turki&s;h Galleys, and had the eighth brought them by the Chri|&s;tian Slaves; who taking their advantage of the Confu&s;ion, ma&s;tered the Turks that were on Board the Galley. and delivered them&s;elves up to the Knights of <HI>Malta;</HI> who be&s;ides the&s;e eight Galleys which had all been com|manded by <HI>Beys,</HI> and carried Flags, took three Gallea&s;&s;es, and gave liberty to two thou&s;and five hundred Chri&s;tian Slaves, who were on Board the&s;e Ve&s;&s;els; and when they were come to <HI>Malta,</HI> gave them all new Cloaths, and Money to carry them to their own Countries: They made al&s;o a great many Turks Slaves. When the Fight was over, the Turks had no more remain|ing but eighteen Galleys, one <HI>Maone,</HI> and the five <HI>Brigantins;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The lo&s;s of Turki&s;h &s;hips</NOTE> So that in that Engagement, they lo&s;t &s;even and twenty Ships, &s;even and thirty Galleys, and eight <HI>Maones.</HI> They would not certainly have &s;aved a Sail, had it not been for the Guns of the Ca&s;tles, which &s;hattered the Chri&s;tian Ships that came too near and covered the Turki&s;h Fleet; be&s;ides the Chri&s;tians were afraid they might run a Ground; for mo&s;t of the Ve&s;&s;els of the Infidels that remain|ed ran a &s;hoar, as the <HI>Ba&s;tarde,</HI> wherein was the Captain <HI>Ba&s;ha,</HI> did, to &s;ave them&s;elves from the Knights of <HI>Malta,</HI> who had re&s;olved at any rate to take her, and carry her off to <HI>Malta;</HI> but they lo&s;t her in the Smoak; however they very narrowly mi&s;&s;ed being taken by the Chri&s;tians in another manner; for the Slaves endeavoured to become ma&s;ters of her, and had done it, but for that Renegado <HI>Italian</HI> I mentioned before, who came with his Son and turned Turk at <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> a few days before the Fleet &s;et out: This Traiterous Villain enraged to &s;ee the Chri&s;tians his Country-men, and not long before his Brethren, pro&s;per, perceiving that the Slaves endeavoured to carry away the <HI>Ba&s;tarde</HI> wherein he was, in&s;tead of making amends for his fault by a timely Repentance, and joining with them in the Execution of the de&s;ign, he drew his Cimetere and cut off the Heads of the Bolde&s;t of the poor wretches, and by that means di&s;appointed the De&s;ign, and &s;aved the <HI>Ba&s;tarde.</HI> The Turks lo&s;t a va&s;t number of Men; for be&s;ides tho&s;e that were Killed and made Slaves, many threw them&s;elves into the Sea to &s;wim a &s;hoar, of whom &s;ome were Drowned, and mo&s;t part Killed; for they &s;tayed not to take them up, but knocked them on the head with Poles, as that <HI>Provenceal</HI> Renegado told me, who &s;eeing the Ship wherein he was, taken by the Chri&s;tians, and fearing to be &s;erved as one that had renounced his Religion, leaped into the Sea, and had enough to do to &s;ave him&s;elf; for not only it concerned him to have a care of the Chri&s;tian Ve&s;&s;els, becau&s;e of their Poles, but al&s;o of tho&s;e who not knowing how to &s;wim, endeavoured to catch hold of any thing to &s;ave them&s;elves by; at length for all the care he took, a Turk took hold of his Foot, telling him that he mu&s;t either &s;ave him, or both Peri&s;h; finding him&s;elf in this danger, he told the Turk that he could not &s;ave him in that po&s;ture, but that if he would get upon his Back, he would do his be&s;t; which the Turk a little too credulous attempting to do, no &s;ooner had he let go his Foot, but he gave him a punch on the Belly, and made all ha&s;te to land; where &s;iting down to re&s;t him&s;elf, two other Turks, who had &s;wam a &s;hoar as well as he, having re&s;ted in the &s;ame place, and ri&s;ing up to be gone, were both &s;hot clo&s;e by him, with a Canon-Bullet from the Sea. I thought fit to mention all the&s;e particulars, as &s;uppo&s;ing they will not be unplea&s;ing to the Reader. This was &s;o great an overthrow, that it put all the Turks into a con&s;ternation;<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Con&s;ter|nation of the Turks after the Over|throw.</NOTE> who were &s;o terrified, that they imagined them&s;elves to be Slaves to the <HI>Venetians</HI> already. The <HI>Grand Signior</HI> took this lo&s;s &s;o much to Heart, that for a whole day he would not eat, nor receive any comfort, but wept bitterly; nay before any news of it was brought, his Barber having told him that he heard &s;ay, the Turki&s;h Fleet was Defeated, he cau&s;ed him immediately to be put to Death. When he had got certain Intelligence of it, he ordered Sol|diers to be forthwith &s;ent to all the I&s;les and other places; where he feared the <HI>Venetians</HI> might make a de&s;cent; and becau&s;e he was apprehen&s;ive that they might come to <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> he cau&s;ed the Hou&s;es that were upon the Walls to be pulled down, becau&s;e they might facilitate the Burning, and hinder the

defence of the City. For my own part I make no doubt, but that if they had appeared, the Turks would have abandoned <HI>Con&s;tantinople;</HI> it is mo&s;t cer|tain that the <HI>Grand Signior</HI> would have immediately fled over to <HI>A&s;ia;</HI> and a great many among them &s;aid, that the time was come which had been fore|told by a <HI>Scheik</HI> or <HI>Imam,</HI> to wit, that the time would come when a <HI>Chequin</HI> would be offered for a place in a <HI>Perme,</HI> to go from <HI>Con&s;tantinople</HI> to <HI>Scudaret,</HI> and could not be had. This Overthrow had been foretold by &s;everal Turks to be greater than it was, for before the Fleet put out from <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> I was told that &s;ome Turks had predicted that not one &s;ail of them &s;hould come back again,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The taking of <HI>Tenedo</HI> and <HI>Lemnos.</HI></NOTE> and that the Chri&s;tians &s;hould not only defeat it, but take <HI>Canea</HI> al&s;o the &s;ame year, which neverthele&s;s proved not to be true; but the <HI>Venetians</HI> took <HI>Tenedo</HI> and <HI>Lemnos,</HI> which would have much incommoded the Turks, if the Chri&s;tians had kept them; for keeping &s;ome Gallies and Gallea&s;&s;es at <HI>Tenedo,</HI> they would have deprived the Turks of <HI>Greece,</HI> of all Commerce by Sea with <HI>Aegypt;</HI> but the Turks &s;oon after took both the&s;e I&s;lands.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Captain <HI>Ba&s;ha</HI> turned out.</NOTE> After this great Overthrow, every one thought that the Captain <HI>Ba&s;ha</HI> would lo&s;e his Head, and yet he had &s;o good Friends that they &s;aved him, only he was made <HI>Man&s;oul;</HI> and in his place was employed <HI>Seyd Hamet Ba&s;ha,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Name of of the Cap|tain <HI>Ba&s;ha.</HI></NOTE> with orders to the Captain <HI>Ba&s;ha Man&s;oul</HI> to go to <HI>Negrepont;</HI> of which he was made <HI>Ba&s;ha.</HI> This man named <HI>Ourous Kienan Ba&s;ha</HI> was by Nation a <HI>Ru&s;&s;ian;</HI> and one Night when the <HI>Tartars</HI> plundered the Village where he was, they found him at the age of &s;ix Months lying &s;tark naked on a heap of Chaff; they took him, and with other Slaves &s;ent him to <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> where he was &s;old, and brought up in the Turki&s;h Religion, wherein his luck was &s;o good, that he attained to the highe&s;t places. <HI>Sunday</HI> the &s;ixth of <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> late in the Night,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The return of &s;ome of the remaining Ve&s;&s;els to <HI>Con&s;tantinople.</HI></NOTE> when hardly any thing could be &s;een, &s;even Turki&s;h Galleys and a <HI>Maone,</HI> which were part of the remaining Fleet, came into the Port at <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> without any noi&s;e, having no Colours nor Main-ma&s;ts, but only the fore Ma&s;t &s;tanding: we who were <HI>Franks</HI> rejoiced at all this in pri|vate, but &s;o far from making any Publick rejoicing; it behoved us to act the Turks and &s;eem &s;orrowful for the Chri&s;tians good &s;ucce&s;s: Neverthele&s;s, af|ter the lo&s;s of that Battel the Turks conceived &s;o great hatred and rage again&s;t the Chri&s;tians, that the very &s;ight of a <HI>Frank</HI> brought it into their mind; nay many of them &s;eeing <HI>Frank</HI> Merchants pa&s;s along in <HI>Galata,</HI> could not forbear to &s;ay openly, <HI>We &s;hall &s;ee at</HI> Bairam <HI>what will become of the&s;e Hats;</HI> &s;o that tho&s;e who heard the words telling them to one another,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The fear of the <HI>Franks</HI> at <HI>Con&s;tantinople.</HI></NOTE> we thought we had rea&s;on to apprehend that they might take the day of Bairam to Ma&s;&s;acre all the <HI>Franks:</HI> It was known al&s;o that &s;everal <HI>Janizaries</HI> were come a &s;hoar one night in <HI>Galata,</HI> and this gave us great &s;u&s;picion, for we ought to fear every thing from Bruiti&s;h People, e&s;pecially when they are provoked.

At Ma&s;s they Con&s;ecrate with Leavened Bread, &s;uch as we commonly eat; they Communicate under both kinds, a&s;wel Laicks as Prie&s;ts, and a&s;wel Women and Children as Men. They have four Lents,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Greeks</HI> Lents.</NOTE> and begin the Fir&s;t &s;ix weeks before <HI>Ea&s;ter,</HI> which they con|tinue till <HI>Ea&s;ter</HI> Day.

After all the&s;e came eleven Hor&s;es in rich Trappings, with a great many preti|ous Stones on all &s;ides, and Stirrups, &s;ome of Silver, others of Silver guilt, with a gro&s;s Mace of Silver at the Saddle-bow on the right &s;ide, and on the other &s;ide a pretty broad Knife, but no longer than half an Arms length, all &s;et with pretious Stones. The&s;e Hor&s;es were led by &s;o many <HI>Spahis,</HI> well Mounted. After the&s;e Hor&s;es came the <HI>Solaques</HI> on foot, above Five hundred in number, having the <HI>Doliman</HI> buckled up under the Girdle, with hanging Sleeves behind, and upon their Head a Cap with Feathers, like the <HI>Chorbadgis,</HI> carrying their Bows in hand, and Quivers full of Arrows at their Back. In the middle of the&s;e was the <HI>Grand Signior,</HI> Mounted on a lovely Cour&s;er, covered almo&s;t with pretious Stones; he wore a Ve&s;t of Crim&s;on-Velvet, and in his Cap two black herons Tops adorned with large Stones, above two Fingers high, the one &s;tood upright, and the other pointed downwards: By his right Stirrup was the chief Ma&s;ter of the Hor&s;e, and the other on the Left, both on foot. He &s;aluted all the People, having his Right Hand con&s;tantly on his Brea&s;t, bowing fir&s;t to one &s;ide, and then to the other, and the People with a low and re&s;pectful Voice, wi&s;hed him all Happine&s;s and Pro&s;perity. After the <HI>Grand Signior,</HI> the <HI>Salihhtar Aga</HI> came on Hor&s;e-back, carrying the Sword, Bow and Quiver of the <HI>Grand Signior,</HI> and on his Left Hand the Ma&s;ter of the Ward|robe, carrying the <HI>Grand Signior</HI>'s Turban; then the <HI>Kzlar Aga&s;i,</HI> the <HI>Capi Aga&s;i,</HI> and two other Pages on Hor&s;e-back al&s;o, carrying Silver-Pots full of Water, to give the <HI>Grand Signior</HI> the <HI>Abde&s;t,</HI> and to Drink if he were a dry. La&s;t of all came a great many that belonged to the <HI>Serraglio,</HI> all well Mounted. When Prayers were over, the <HI>Grand Signior</HI> came back in the &s;ame Order, ha|ving only changed his Ve&s;t, and put on one of a fire Red Satin. Whil&s;t he pa&s;&s;ed by, a wretched Ru&s;&s;ian Slave cried, that he would be a Turk; and im|mediately the <HI>Grand Signior</HI> ordered a <HI>Capidgi</HI> to carry him to the <HI>Serraglio.</HI> Many &s;uch Rogues intending to be Turks, wait the opportunity of the <HI>Grand Signior</HI>'s pa&s;&s;ing, that they may make profe&s;&s;ion of the <HI>Mahometan</HI> Faith in his pre&s;ence, and have therefore &s;ome Pay ordered them by his Maje&s;ty.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Caravane</HI> of <HI>Bur&s;a.</HI></NOTE>BEing at <HI>Bur&s;a,</HI> I made ready to go to <HI>Smyrna</HI> with the <HI>Caravane,</HI> that every <HI>Thur&s;day</HI> goes from <HI>Bur&s;a</HI> to <HI>Smyrna;</HI> but becau&s;e it was late before I came on <HI>Thur&s;day,</HI> it behoved me to &s;tay Eight days; in the mean time I made my provi&s;ions, and that care is of no &s;mall con&s;equence, for you mu&s;t make account to find nothing but water upon the Road; and therefore one mu&s;t carry a field-Bed to lye on; Bisket, (for Bread will be &s;poyled;) a good Pa&s;tie; Wine, (if you have a mind to drink any) in a <HI>Borachio,</HI> or other Ve&s;&s;el; Vinager, Oyle, Salt, Candle, and all &s;orts of Uten&s;iles, not forget|ing a Candle&s;tick; in &s;hort, one mu&s;t carry a kind of Hou&s;e-hold-&s;tuff along with him, if he would Travel conveniently. The Turks are very dextrous at that, for without any clutter, they carry along with them all that is nece&s;&s;ary, and tru&s;t not to the places upon the Road for &s;upply; nay, they will as ea&s;ily Boyl the Kettle in a De&s;ert, as at home in their own Hou&s;es. This was the fir&s;t time that ever I went in a <HI>Caravane,</HI> and therefore the&s;e pre|parations &s;eemed a little uncouth unto me. <HI>Caravanes</HI> are a&s;&s;emblies of Tra|vellers who join them&s;elves and Baggage together, that they may go in company to any Place,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Caravane.</NOTE> and &s;o be better able to defend them&s;elves again&s;t Rob|bers, it any be abroad in the High-ways.

In fine all things are good and cheap at <HI>Smyrna;</HI> but it is a Town much &s;ubject to Earthquakes,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Smyrna</HI> much &s;ubject to Earthquakes.</NOTE> and hath been &s;everal times ruined by them; but &s;till rebuilt, becau&s;e of the convenience of its Scituation: no year pa&s;&s;es without them; and I was told that &s;ome Years they felt very great Earthquakes for the &s;pace of fourty Days together, which began a fre&s;h every half hour, and were felt even by the Ships in the Road, being to&s;&s;ed by the Wa|ters, which were moved by the &s;haking of the Ground in the bottom. It would be very hot being in this Town in the Summer-time, were it not for the Wind,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Low Wind.</NOTE> which they call the low Wind, or North Breeze; it is a certain Wind that blows from the North regularly every day, and much qualifies the Air. There is a great trade of Commodities from all parts of <HI>A&s;ia</HI> and <HI>Chri&s;tendom</HI> in this Town. While I was there, I had a great de&s;ire to &s;ee <HI>Ephe&s;us,</HI> which was heretofore one of the &s;even Churches, as well as <HI>Smyrna,</HI> to which St. <HI>John</HI> directed his Revelations, where he Died, and wherein &s;till remain to be &s;een the ruines of the Temple of <HI>Diana,</HI> one of the &s;even Wonders of the World; and to the Ornament and Embelli&s;hment whereof all the Kings of <HI>A&s;ia</HI> contributed &s;o long; which was burn'd by <HI>Ero|&s;tratus,</HI> who thereby coveted to Immortalize his Memory. There are ma|ny other things worth the &s;eeing at <HI>Ephe&s;us,</HI> which made me willing to have undertaken a progre&s;s of three or four days; for <HI>Ephe&s;us</HI> is no more than fourty Miles from <HI>Smyrna:</HI> But Mon&s;ieur <HI>Du puy</HI> the French Con&s;ul, who &s;hewed me in that Country all kinds of civility, would needs take me off on't, becau&s;e of Robbers that were upon the Roads; who were a remnant of tho&s;e that were routed at the <HI>Dardanelles,</HI> and who gave no Quarter, e&s;pecially to Chri&s;tians: but finding at length that I was earne&s;t upon it, he took the pains of chu&s;ing two <HI>Janizaries</HI> to wait upon me, of whom one who him&s;elf had been a Robber many years, promi&s;ed to bring me &s;afe back again, as pretending acquaintance of the&s;e Robbers.

<P>THough I had re&s;olved to continue my Travels through <HI>A&s;ia,</HI> yet I had heard &s;o much of the Wonders of <HI>Chio,</HI> that I could not but &s;ee it, being then &s;o near; therefore I hired a Boat to carry me thither, and embarked on <HI>Wedne&s;day</HI> morning, the Eleventh of <HI>October.</HI> A little after, we had very foul weather, which made me blame my curio&s;ity oftner than once; and it behoved us to lye in the Boat near the &s;hore, not without danger of being taken by the Brigantines, for there are always &s;ome in the <HI>Archipelago,</HI> and when they take <HI>Franks,</HI> they &s;ell them at <HI>Rhodes</HI> to <HI>Barbary</HI> men, not daring to carry them. into any part of <HI>Turkie,</HI> for then the Amba&s;&s;adours would get them &s;et at liberty At length, <HI>Thur&s;day</HI> the Twelfth of <HI>October,</HI> in the dusk of the Evening, we arrived in the Port of <HI>Chio.</HI> I went and lodged with <HI>Mon&s;ieur Mille,</HI> the <HI>French</HI> Vice-Con&s;ul, for that place belongs to the Con&s;ul&s;hip of <HI>Smyrna.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Chio</HI> is a &s;mall Town, but well peopled,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chio.</NOTE> and mo&s;t part of the Inhabitants are Chri&s;tians, <HI>Greeks</HI> or <HI>Latins,</HI> who have each of them there a Bi&s;hop and &s;everal Churches; but the <HI>Greeks</HI> have many more than the <HI>Latins,</HI> becau&s;e every one of their <HI>Papas</HI> has his Church, not allowing above one Ma&s;s a day to be &s;aid in every Church. They have al&s;o many Convents of Nuns, who are not &s;o &s;trictly &s;hut up and look't after, as tho&s;e of the <HI>Latins</HI> are; for I remem|ber I went into one of the&s;e Nunneries, where I &s;aw here and there both Chri|&s;tians and Turks, and then having entered the Chamber of one of the Si&s;ters, I found that &s;he was kind, even beyond the bounds of Chri&s;tian charity. The Nuns when they put them&s;elves in there, buy a Lodging; they go abroad when then they plea&s;e, and even leave the Convent when they have a mind; they Embroider in Gold, Silver, and Silk, in which the <HI>Greek</HI> Women are very skilful, Embroidering very lovely Flowers upon Handkerchiefs, Pur&s;es, and &s;uch like things. The <HI>Latins</HI> have five Churches in the Town, the fir&s;t is the Church of the Bi&s;hoprick, which is fair and large; it is not very old, having been built but &s;ince the Turks were Ma&s;ters of <HI>Chio,</HI> becau&s;e the Church and Bi&s;hop's Hou&s;e are in the Ca&s;tle, and the Turks having converted the Church into a Mo&s;que, &s;uffered the Bi&s;hop to build another in the Town, which &s;hould be of the &s;ame length, breadth and height, according to the agreement made betwixt the King of <HI>France</HI> and the <HI>Grand Signior;</HI> wherein it is &s;pecified, that the Turks &s;hall not ruine the Chri&s;tians Churches, nor take them from them, but that the Chri&s;tians &s;hall enjoy them in full liberty; and al&s;o that the Chri|&s;tians &s;hall not repair them when they fall to ruine, nor yet build any new. The Bi&s;hop having obtained that permi&s;&s;ion, bought a place in the Town, where he built his Church and Hou&s;e. In that Church are interred the <HI>French</HI> who die in <HI>Chio,</HI> in a Burying-place which <HI>M. John Dupuis</HI> of <HI>Mar&s;eilles,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">M.

<P>The Town of <HI>Chio</HI> (as I &s;aid) is but &s;mall, and yet hath eight Gates. It is not &s;trong at all,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Ca&s;tle of <HI>Chio.</HI></NOTE> but it hath a pretty good Ca&s;tle that defends it, and com|mands it al&s;o. The Turks live there, and commonly there are eight hundred Men in it. No Chri&s;tian may lodge there, but the Jews for a certain &s;umm of Money, which they pay yearly, live there; for they would not be &s;o &s;afe, nor &s;o well accommodated among the Chri&s;tians, who would often abu&s;e them. This Ca&s;tle is a mile in circumference, and you mu&s;t pa&s;s three Gates before you enter it; over the third are &s;till to be &s;een, the Ca&s;tle with three Towers, and the Eagle of &s;tone in relief,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Arms of the <HI>Ju&s;tinians</HI> at <HI>Chio.</HI></NOTE> which are the Arms of the <HI>Ju&s;tiniani Genoe&s;e</HI> Lords, to whom heretofore that I&s;le belonged, with the Title of a Principa|lity.

<P>BEing curious to &s;ee the Trees that yield Ma&s;tick,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ma&s;tick-Tree</NOTE> which is gathered no where but in this I&s;land, I got a <HI>Janizary</HI> from the Ma&s;ter of the Cu&s;tome-hou&s;e, and went with the Vice-Con&s;ul to <HI>Calimacha,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Calimacha.</NOTE> which is one of the chief Villages of the I&s;land.

There are &s;ix <HI>Greek</HI> Churches in this Village, and about thirty round it, with a Convent of Nuns. This place is very well peopled, and when I went there, there were in it (as I was told) three hundred and forty eight Men, who paid the <HI>Karadge,</HI> all married; for tho&s;e who are unmarried, pay no <HI>Karadge</HI> in that place. Near to this Town, there are three|&s;core Ma&s;tick-Trees, which I went to &s;ee; they are <HI>Lentisks,</HI> crooked like Vines, and creeping upon the ground. <HI>Dio&s;corides</HI> affirms, that they yield Ma|&s;tick in &s;everal other places, but &s;till acknowledges, that the Ma&s;tick that grows el&s;ewhere, is rarer, and not &s;o good as that of <HI>Chio;</HI> for having it, they prick the&s;e Trees in the Months of <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> and <HI>September,</HI> and the Ma&s;tick,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ma&s;tick.</NOTE> which is their Gumm, &s;weating out by the holes they have made in the Bark, runs down the Tree and falls upon the ground, where it congeals into flat pieces, which &s;ome time after they gather, then dry them in the Sun, and afterwards range and &s;hake them in a Ranging-&s;ive, to &s;eparate the du&s;t from them, which &s;o &s;ticks to the faces of tho&s;e that handle the Sive, that they cannot get it off, but by rubbing their faces with Oyl. There are two and twenty Villages that have Ma&s;tick-Trees, and among them all, they have an hundred thou&s;and of them, for which they yearly pay to the <HI>Grand Signior</HI> three hundred Che&s;ts of Ma&s;tick, which make &s;even and twenty thou&s;and <HI>Oques,</HI> at four&s;core and ten <HI>Oques</HI> the Che&s;t, and every <HI>Oque</HI> contains four hundred Drachms.

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. LXIII.</HI> Of &s;ome Villages of the I&s;le of <HI>Chio.</HI></HEAD>
<P>HEre I &s;hall mention the chief Villages of the I&s;le of <HI>Chio,</HI> which I did not &s;ee, but according as a Manu&s;cript Relation that came to my Hands, Written by one who lived &s;everal Years in that I&s;land, has informed me. The Village of <HI>Cardamila,</HI> which we ju&s;t now mentioned,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cardamila.</NOTE> contains about Five hundred Inhabitants; the Country about it is beautified by many fair Water Springs, and is very Fertile, yielding Yearly about an Hundred and &s;ixty, or &s;eventy Tuns of Wine: Some years ago, &s;everal pieces of Gold, Silver, and Copper Money of the Emperour <HI>Con&s;tantine,</HI> were found there. Five Miles from that Village, there is a lovely Valley, half a Mile long,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A lovely Valley in the I&s;le of <HI>Chio.</HI></NOTE> and there|in a Spring of Water, to which one goes down by a Stair-ca&s;e of thirty lovely Marble &s;teps. At the farther end of this Valley there was a Temple, built all of pieces of A&s;h-coloured Marble, eight Hands breadth long, and &s;ix broad, which were well fa&s;tned together with Iron and Lead; but the Country People have broken the&s;e fine Stones, to get out the Mettal. That place is called <HI>Naos</HI> (that is to &s;ay) Temple,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Naos. Vichi.</NOTE> the Gentlemen of <HI>Chio</HI> go commonly there for their Diver&s;ion. Beyond that, there is a Village, called <HI>Vichi,</HI> inhabited by Three hundred Souls, and hath a Church dedicated to the Virgin. Farther on is <HI>Cambia,</HI> containing an hundred Inhabitants;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cambia.</NOTE> this place lies among&s;t Rocks, Hills, and Woods of wild Pine-trees, and there it is that they Fell the Timber for Building of Galleys; there are &s;everal Churches here and there among the Mountains.

the I&s;land, and may even be &s;een from <HI>Tenedo,</HI> which is many Miles more than an hundred di&s;tant from <HI>Chio;</HI> on the top of this Mount there is a Church, dedicated to that Saint. This is &s;o high a place, that it is always covered with Mi&s;ts and Snow. In the middle of the Mountain, there is &s;o large and copious a Spring, that it Waters all the Fields about, which are fertile, and abound in all &s;orts of Fruits.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Spartonda.</NOTE> In a Wood hard by, there is a Village, called <HI>Spartonda,</HI> where about fifty Per&s;ons only (all Shepherds) live; but it is a delightful place, afford|ing good Water,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Calandre. Coronia.</NOTE> and excellent Fruits. Betwixt the Village of <HI>Calandre,</HI> that &s;tands upon a Hill, and <HI>Coronia,</HI> con&s;i&s;ting of about an Hundred and fifty &s;cattering Hou&s;es, there is a Bath of Sulphur by the Sea-&s;ide, under extraor|dinary big Oaks; this Bath is called <HI>Haya&s;ma,</HI> which &s;ignifies Holy, or Ble&s;&s;ed Water, becau&s;e the Water of it being drank, Cures many Di&s;ea&s;es; but it Kills a great many People too, by the violence of its Operation. Three Miles from the Sea,<NOTE PLACE="marg">St. <HI>Helenas</HI> Town.</NOTE> at the farther end of the I&s;land, is the Town St. <HI>Helena,</HI> built upon a Rock, and containing Two hundred Inhabitants; it hath two Churches, and a Chappel built ju&s;t about the middle of the Hill, where being hollow, there hangs in the middle of it a point of a Rock, from which Water conti|ally drops, and this Water they al&s;o call <HI>Haya&s;ma;</HI> Holy, or Ble&s;&s;ed Wa|ter. This Water comes from the Mountain impregnated with Rain-Water, or the vapours that ri&s;e from a deep Valley underneath, where runs a Water that drives &s;ome Mills. The Inhabitants of this place firmly believe, that if a dead Body do not in forty days time corrupt,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Zorzolacas,</HI> Hobgoblins.</NOTE> it turns to a Hobgoblin, which they call <HI>Zorzolacas,</HI> or <HI>Nomolacas.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A dead body who&s;e Gho&s;t wandred a|bout the Vil|lage in the Night-time.</NOTE>And the Author of the Manu&s;cript, from whence I had this, &s;ays, That Travelling that way in the Month of <HI>April,</HI> 1637. he found a Prie&s;t reading over a dead Body, which he had cau&s;ed to be rai&s;ed, after it had been fifty days in the Grave, and was neverthele&s;s &s;till &s;ound, there being no &s;ign of Corruption about it, but a Worm that crawled out of the Eye. The Prie&s;t told the Man who reports this, that that Body, or rather its Gho&s;t, went all Night about the Village knocking at the Doors, and calling the People by their Names, and that &s;uch as made an&s;wer, died within two or three days after; and that the Worm that came out of his Eye, was but a Trick of the Devils, to make it believed he was rotten. This place is about thirty Miles from the City, and they are all poor Shepherds that live there. The Chappel in the afore&s;aid Rock, is highly e&s;teemed by all the Villages about. From thence one goes to <HI>Voli&s;&s;o,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Voli&s;&s;o.</NOTE> which is a great Village &s;eated on a Hill, with a Ca&s;tle built by <HI>Beli|&s;arius,</HI> General to the Emperour of <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> who going &s;omewhere el&s;e by Sea, was by a Storm forced to put on Shoar in that place; in that Ca&s;tle there is a Church, with &s;everal Hou&s;es and Ci&s;terns; the Village contains about Three hundred Hou&s;es, and about Fifteen hundred Inhabitants, with &s;everal Churches. The Country about it is very Plea&s;ant, Spacious and Fruitful; and the Inhabitants make Five thou&s;and Weight of Silk yearly, with the Mo|ney whereof they pay their Tribute: They are very vicious, and (it is thought) they lie under a Cur&s;e, of being almo&s;t always de&s;titute of Bread. There is a place,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Varvari&s;o.</HI> The transfor|mation of St. <HI>Marcella.</HI></NOTE> called <HI>Varvari&s;o,</HI> where there is a Church dedicated to St-<HI>Marcella,</HI> who (as the Inhabitants of that place &s;ay) was converted into Stone in a Grotto by the Sea-&s;ide; whither &s;he fled to e&s;cape from her Father, who would have Defloured her; and they &s;ay, that on the day when the Church celebrates the Fe&s;tival of that Saint, Milk is &s;een to drop from the Brea&s;ts that are on the Rock:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Panagirio.</NOTE> This with them is a &s;olemn Fea&s;t, which they call <HI>Panagirio,</HI> the Prie&s;ts &s;inging prai&s;es to her all Night long.

Over again&s;t this Village there is a Ca&s;tle, &s;tanding upon a very high Hill, and is called <HI>Apolieno,</HI> built by one <HI>Nicholas Ju&s;tiniani,</HI> in the Year 1440.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Apolieno.</NOTE> as may be &s;een upon the Gate of it. It is of an Oval Figure, with a double Wall, and contains Three&s;core and two Rooms, with two Ci&s;terns; one of which is Three&s;core Foot long, and Forty Foot broad: This Ca&s;tle is very &s;trong to re&s;i&s;t the <HI>Cor&s;ares,</HI> and has a Church in the middle of it.

<P>And in fine,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Why &s;o many Ca&s;tles in the I&s;le of <HI>Chio.</HI></NOTE> that the Reader may know why heretofore they built &s;o many Ca&s;tles and Towers, I &s;hall here give the Rea&s;on of it. The Fields of <HI>Chio</HI> being full of Ma&s;tick-Trees, there was a nece&s;&s;ity of having People to watch them and gather the Gum in the &s;ea&s;ons, wherefore there were little Villages di&s;per&s;ed up and down the Country, &s;ome containing thirty, &s;ome fifty, and &s;ome an hundred Inhabitants; but being infe&s;ted by the Turks of <HI>Anatolia,</HI> which is but about eighteen Miles di&s;tant (who came and carried away both Men and Goods) all the&s;e Villages re&s;olved to joyn three or four together, and to build Ca&s;tles or Towers, to defend them from the&s;e Pirates; and for guard|ing the Trees and Villages, they built Towers round the I&s;land, at three or four Miles di&s;tance one from another.

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. LXIV.</HI> Of the I&s;le of <HI>Chio,</HI> and its Inhabitants.</HEAD>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Chio.</NOTE>CHIO, called by the Turks <HI>Saki&s;ada&s;i,</HI> that is to &s;ay the I&s;le of <HI>Mastick,</HI> is a famous I&s;land of the <HI>Archipelago,</HI> about an hundred miles from <HI>Smyr|na,</HI> though it would not be &s;o far, if one kept a &s;treight cour&s;e; but one mu&s;t go round a Hill,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Xamos, <HI>or</HI> Sou&s;ambogazi.</NOTE> which the Greeks call <HI>Xamos,</HI> the Turks <HI>Sou&s;ambogazi,</HI> that runs a great way out into the Sea. This I&s;land belonged heretofore to the <HI>Ju&s;tiniani</HI> Genoe&s;e Lords, with the title of a Principality; but it was taken in the year 1566. by a Captain <HI>Ba&s;ha,</HI> named <HI>Pialis</HI> and &s;ubjected to the Turks. The I&s;le of <HI>Chio</HI> is four&s;core Miles in Circuit, and very Populous, having a City and above three&s;core Towns and Villages, inhabited for the mo&s;t part only by Chri&s;tians; and the whole Land is full of Country Habitations con&s;i&s;ting of a little &s;pot of Ground and a little Tower-hou&s;e, with two or three Rooms, &s;o that it &s;eems to be a Town in the Fields, like the Country about <HI>Mar&s;eilles.</HI> It is an I&s;land much &s;ubject to Earth-quakes, and would be very Fertile, if it were not &s;o Stony, and had more Water; for it Rains &s;o little there, that every Spring they are fain to make Proce&s;&s;ions through the City for obtaining Rain from Heaven: The Turks fir&s;t make theirs, next the Greeks, then the Latines, and la&s;tly the Jews. The Turks are very little concerned which of all the&s;e Prayers be heard,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ju&s;tiniani.</NOTE> provided they have what they ask, but notwith&s;tanding the Hilline&s;s and dryne&s;s of the I&s;land, yet it has all things nece&s;&s;ary in &s;ufficient quantity, and good. It yields Corn, plenty of very good Wine, but &s;o thick that many do not like it, becau&s;e (as they &s;ay) they mu&s;t both eat and drink it. All things are very cheap there, and excellent good Partridges may be had for little or nothing;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Partridges cheap, and how they are bred.</NOTE> but it is curious to &s;ee how they breed up tho&s;e Birds at <HI>Chio:</HI> For there are Pea&s;ants like publick Keepers, who are paid by all that have Partridges for feeding them, and the&s;e Men having called them all about them in the Morning with a Whi&s;tle, lead them out into the Fields as one drives Turkies, and &s;o &s;oon as they are come to the &s;ide of a Hill where he drives them, they &s;catter and feed where they can be&s;t; and in the Evening, he who hath the care of them coming to the Hill, falls a Whi&s;tling very loud, and then all his Partridges gather about him, and return Home to their &s;everal Ma&s;ters, none ever &s;taying behind. The&s;e Creatures under|&s;tand &s;o well the call of him who commonly feeds them, that let another Whi&s;tle never &s;o much, they will not come to him.</P>
<P>When I was at <HI>Chio,</HI> I could not have that Diver&s;ion, for then it was not the Sea&s;on.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tame Par|tridges.</NOTE> I have &s;een of the&s;e Partridges more tame than any Pullets, for they would let any body touch them and &s;troke them, without &s;tirring from their place.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The &s;ole I&s;le of <HI>Chio</HI> hath pre&s;erved its Liberty.</NOTE> This is the only I&s;land among the Turks that hath pre&s;erved its Li|berty, for the Inhabitants live as they think fit, profe&s;&s;ing and exerci&s;ing their Religion with all imaginable freedom, only they are Subjects to the Turks, and pay him Tribute; but they are in no ways mole&s;ted, nor burthened with Impo&s;itions. The <HI>Chiots</HI> are generally Chri&s;tians, and there are very few Turks among them; a good part of the&s;e Chri&s;tians are Roman Catholicks, and the re&s;t are of the Greek Church. All the Inhabitants, both Greeks and Latins,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Families of the <HI>Ju&s;tiniani.</HI></NOTE> have much of the Humour of the Genoe&s;e, who formerly Governed them. There are &s;everal Families &s;till in that I&s;land, who derive them&s;elves from the Hou&s;e of the <HI>Ju&s;tiniani;</HI> for they &s;till make a di&s;tinction betwixt the Gentlemen (who are pretty numerous) and the Plebeians.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The manners of the <HI>Chiots.</HI></NOTE> the <HI>Chiots</HI> are Apparelled after the <HI>Geone&s;e</HI> Fa&s;hion, they are ugly, and though their Per&s;ons be proper and well &s;haped, yet their looks would &s;care a body; they are very proud, and neverthele&s;s, Gentlemen and all go to Market, and buying what they want, carry it openly along the Streets, without any &s;hame. They love the Spaniards better then the French, but had rather be under the Government

of the Turks than Chri&s;tians: The <HI>Chiots</HI> make much Damask, Sattin, Taf|fetaes, and other Silk Stuffs, and drive a great Trade in many places with their <HI>Saiques.</HI> Such as neither Work nor Travel abroad, &s;pend whole days Sitting and Talking together under Trees. Letters are in no vogue in that Country, and perfound Ignorance reigns among them; neverthele&s;s they have naturally a &s;harp Wit; and are indeed; &s;o great Cheats, that one hath need of both Eyes to deal with them. They are much given to their Plea&s;ures, and Drun|kenne&s;s; and, in a word, they are <HI>Greeks.</HI> The Women are very Beautiful, and well Shaped; their Faces are as white as the faire&s;t Ja&s;min, that they commonly carry on their Heads. And I never &s;aw in any Country, Women that had &s;o much beauty and charmingne&s;s in the Face (I &s;ay in the Face) for their Brea&s;ts are &s;corched with the Sun and black, at which I have often wondred, &s;eeing they take no more care to keep their Faces than their Brea&s;ts. For my part, I could not but Quarrel with them &s;ometimes, that they covered not their Brea&s;ts with &s;ome Handkerchief, or other Linnen; for if they did, nothing could be more lovely. Their Habit contributes much al&s;o to &s;et off their Beauty, for they are always very Neat in their Dre&s;s, wearing on their Heads very white Linnen, &s;haped like a little Capucins Hood, &s;quatted at the end: Be&s;ides all the&s;e External Charms, they have &s;omething that is more &s;olid, for they have a brisk and merry Wit, that renders them the mo&s;t taking Women in the World; but if they be Pretty, they are al&s;o extreamly Vain, and that is a Vice in&s;eparable from the Sex. They wear the fine&s;t Stuffs that they can get, and yet it is nothing now to what it has been formerly; for the meane&s;t of them, even to the Coblers Wife, would needs have love|ly Velvet-Shoes, that co&s;t five or &s;ix Crowns, Neck-laces and Bracelets of Gold, and their Fingers full of Rings; but they payed d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="2 letters">r one day for their Vanity. The Church of St. <HI>John</HI> is a Mu&s;ket-&s;hot without the Town,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A &s;tory of the Braveries of the <HI>Chiots.</HI></NOTE> upon the Sea-&s;ide, on the Vigil of that Saints Day, there is a great Con|cour&s;e of People at that Church, all the I&s;land are there, and the Women and Girls &s;trive who &s;hall be fine&s;t: This Day being come, they opened their Coffers, and brought out all the rich and fine Things they had, and &s;uch as had no Ornaments of their own, went and borrowed of their Friends: When they had Dre&s;t them&s;elves to the be&s;t Advantage they could, they went after Dinner to St. <HI>Johns;</HI> now near the Gate by which they go to that Church, there is a Tower, on the top thereof was the Captain <HI>Ba&s;ha,</HI> who beheld them as they pa&s;&s;ed by, which did not a little puff them up. When the Service was over, they &s;topt before the Tower as they came back, and there fell a Dancing before the Captain <HI>Ba&s;ha,</HI> who &s;eemed to be much taken with it; but next day, the <HI>Ba&s;ha</HI> demanded an Hundred thou|&s;and <HI>Pia&s;tres</HI> of the Citizens, &s;aying, That he &s;tood in need of it again&s;t the coming of the <HI>Grand Signior.</HI> They made excu&s;e,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Chiots</HI> fined for their Vanity.</NOTE> pretending that they had it not; but he &s;topt their Mouths with this reply, That they could find enough to load their Wives and Daughters with Gold; and all they could do, was to compound with the Captain <HI>Ba&s;ha,</HI> and pay him Fifty thou&s;and <HI>Pia&s;tres.</HI> After that, both the <HI>Greeks</HI> and <HI>Latins,</HI> with common con&s;ent, got their Bi&s;hops to charge the Women under pain of Excommunication, not to wear any Jewel, Gold or Silver about them; but they not enduring to lay a&s;ide their Ornaments, &s;lighted and laught at the Excommunication, until at length, they procured one from the Pope; &s;ince that time they have not worn any. The <HI>Chiots</HI> are much given to Dancing, both Men and Wo|men, and on Sundays and Holydays in the Evening, they fall all a Dancing promi&s;cuou&s;ly together in a Ring, which continues all Night, not only in the City but Villages; and a Stranger newly come, who neither knows, nor is known of any, may freely put in with the re&s;t, and take the faire&s;t by the Hand without any Scandal, more or le&s;s than in our Country Towns in <HI>France.</HI> And I know no other difference betwixt the <HI>Chiots</HI> and <HI>Genoe&s;e,</HI> but that the former are not at all Jealous: For though they be in a Country where a Woman dares not &s;hew her &s;elf to a Man, unle&s;s &s;he would be taken for a Strumpet. Yet the Women of this I&s;le, have retained &s;o great Liberty, both in the City and Villages, that the Maids &s;pend com|monly the Days and Evenings at their Doors, talking and playing with
<PB N="102" REF="71">

But to have the greater Di|ver&s;ion, it is nece&s;&s;ary that one &s;hould &s;matter a little in the vulgar <HI>Greek,</HI> for though &s;everal of them under&s;tand <HI>Italian,</HI> yet their u&s;ual Language is the vulgar <HI>Greek,</HI> which is for the mo&s;t part but the literal <HI>Greek</HI> cor|rupted. A Je&s;uit of <HI>Chio</HI> told me, that <HI>Pietro Della Valle,</HI> a Roman Gentle|man, who publi&s;hed his Travels, being at <HI>Chio,</HI> ob&s;erved two things there, which he wondred to find together, to wit, great Mirth and Slavery: As to Slavery, I think they have no more of that but the Name, and certainly there is le&s;s Slavery there, than in any other place of <HI>Turkie.</HI> As for their Mirth,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An imperti|nent thought of the <HI>Ita|lians.</HI></NOTE> I wonder not at all that it &s;eemed &s;trange to that Gentleman, who was of a Country where the Men are fully per&s;uaded, that a Wo|man who Conver&s;es with a Man, is ready to grant him all that he can de|&s;ire of her; it is al&s;o true, that at that time they made a great deal Mer|rier at <HI>Chio,</HI> than when I was there; for &s;eeing in my time, they were very apprehen&s;ive of the <HI>Venetians</HI> after the Battel of the <HI>Dardanelles.</HI> Four <HI>Ba&s;has</HI> with their Attendants, were come there, and Lodged all in the Citizens Hou&s;es, who were forced to leave them to the Turks. The fourth of the&s;e <HI>Ba&s;has</HI> arrived at <HI>Chio,</HI> whil&s;t I was there, and &s;eeing the Magi&s;trates of the Town had a&s;&s;igned him a Quarter for him&s;elf and Men, they who&s;e Hou&s;es were appointed for the Turks, making difficulty to open their Doors, be|cau&s;e they were in hopes to get off by delaying, the Turks that were to Quarter there broke open their Doors with Hatchets, and all over that Quarter where we Lodged, there was nothing to be heard but a horrid noi&s;e of blows of Hatchets, and the cries of Women who were in the Hou&s;es within. Tho&s;e who were le&s;s ob&s;tinate, removed their Goods quickly to the Hou&s;es of their Friends, becau&s;e they were obliged to give them no more but the bare Walls; but it was a &s;ad &s;ight to &s;ee People forced to leave their Hou&s;es to Men that they knew not, without knowing where to go and Lodg them&s;elves; and it &s;eemed to me to be a faint repre&s;entation of a Town taken by Storm. The Hou&s;e of our Vice-Con&s;ul,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Pre&s;ent &s;ent to a <HI>Ba&s;ha</HI> that came to <HI>Chio.</HI></NOTE> was exempted from &s;uch Gue&s;ts, by the means of &s;ome good Friends that he had. Next day after that <HI>Ba&s;ha</HI> arrived, the Con&s;uls of the City &s;ent him the u&s;ual Pre&s;ent, which con&s;i&s;ted of two Baskets full of Bread, eight white Wax-Tapers of an ordinary bigne&s;s, five Sugar-Loaves, three Pots of Honey, three Pots of Orange-Water, two Baskets full of Pomegranates, two of Limons, two of Water-Melons, two of <HI>Mezingianes,</HI> or Violet-Naveurs, one of Grapes, one of Gra&s;s, half a dozen of Pidgeons, a dozen of Pullets, and three Sheep. Next day, his <HI>Kiaya,</HI> or Lieutenant, had likewi&s;e the u&s;ual Pre&s;ent brought to him, which was but one half of the abovementioned Provi&s;ions. They expected two <HI>Ba&s;has</HI> more within a &s;hort time, and the&s;e <HI>Ba&s;has</HI> cau&s;ed Peo|ple to be often Ba&s;tonadoed as they went along the Streets, when they were out of Humour; but for all that, no &s;ooner were they Lodged, but the whole Trouble was over.</P>

The Fields of this I&s;le are mo&s;t fruitful in all things, and chiefly a certain Valley called <HI>Darmilla,</HI> wherein are eighteen Villages.

Late in the Evening the Pea&s;ant goes and joggs the <HI>Partridges</HI> to know where they Sleep; then he pitches a Net where he thinks conveni|ent, and afterwards puts him&s;elf under the belly of his A&s;s, which is trained to the &s;port; and thus both &s;talking along together, the Pea&s;ant with a &s;witch drives the <HI>Partridges</HI> into the Net, where they are caught; and this &s;port is the better, becau&s;e <HI>Partridges</HI> are very Plentiful there. There are be&s;ides other Valleys with Water-&s;prings in them, that turn Mills for the u&s;e of the People. There are &s;everal Mona&s;teries in this I&s;land, one of which ought to be very Ancient; for it is built in form of a Tower upon a Hill. There is another called <HI>Fanaromeni,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Fanaromeni.</NOTE> dedicated to the Virgin; becau&s;e a Picture of the Virgin was found in that Place; which is held in great Veneration, and called <HI>Faneromeni;</HI> it is not long &s;ince that Mona&s;tery was built, and contains three&s;core and ten Rooms or Chambers, be&s;ides tho&s;e that are under Ground: the Church is &s;mall, but well built and beautified; It is &s;erved by ten Monks, all Countrey Clowns, who have no Learning; and not only there, but over all the I&s;les of the <HI>Archipelago;</HI> they are &s;o ignorant, that it may be &s;aid of them <HI>Ignoto Deo;</HI> and it is impo&s;&s;ible but that Vice mu&s;t reign, where People are &s;o ignorant of the commands of God, and where there is &s;o much Idlene&s;s and Drunkenne&s;s. Thre&s;core miles from the Town, there is a Tower, and another Church al&s;o, dedicated to the Virgin, named <HI>Tagia;</HI> in that place there is a Spring of as good Water as can be de&s;ired, and a Monk and &s;ome Shepherds live there; the people of the I&s;land often go thither out of Devotion, and not without much Pain, becau&s;e of the trouble&s;ome Hills and Valleys that are in the way. About &s;ix miles from thence near the Sea, overagain&s;t the I&s;le of <HI>Nicaria,</HI> there is to be &s;een upon a very &s;teep and rug|ged Mountain,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Ca&s;tle of <HI>Apollo.</HI></NOTE> &s;ome ruines of the Ca&s;tle of <HI>Apollo,</HI> and it is a wonder how they could carry up Stones to Build it.

In that Ca&s;tle there are &s;everal Hou&s;es. and Ci&s;terns for Water. In the neigh|bourhood of it are four little Towns very well Inhabited. In the&s;e Quarters there are al&s;o many Goat-heards that keep Goats, and the Hills are full of an Herb which <HI>Mathiolus</HI> calls <HI>Ledum,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Ledum of <HI>Mathiolus.

As you go to the Town, there is a Ca&s;tle upon a very high Hill, which commands all the Villages of <HI>Darmilla.</HI> Near the Town upon a Rock, called heretofore <HI>Strongyle,</HI> is the Palace of the God <HI>Bacchus,</HI> &s;o called in ancient Times; it is an hundred Foot in length, and fifty in breadth, and built of very white Marble, each Stone being &s;ixteen hands long, and &s;even hands thick, which were all fa&s;tened together with Iron and Lead. The Gate is thirty two hands high, and &s;ixteen wide; its lintel is of four pieces. There is no In&s;cription to be &s;een upon it, they being all eaten out by the Sea and Weather; but there are two Ci&s;terns clo&s;e by it. The Turks and others carry away Marble daily from that Palace, for making of Gates, Windows, Mortars, Che&s;ts, and &s;uch like things; nay, and Turbans al&s;o, to be put at the ends of Graves, according to the cu&s;tome of the Turks. The &s;ame <HI>Bacchus,</HI> (as the Inhabitants &s;ay) made an Aqueduct; that brought Water from a very di&s;tant Spring; but having carried it on as far as the Shoar, he Died, and that &s;o it was never perfected; however the Chanels of it are to be &s;een. <HI>Bacchus</HI> was the God of Wine, and therefore the Inhabitants of <HI>Nixia</HI> are &s;o great Drunkards.

very diligent at their duty in the Quire; but their Revenue is very Incon|&s;iderable; and the Arch-Bi&s;hop him&s;elf has no more than two hundred <HI>Pia&s;tres</HI> of yearly Rent. He hath a &s;eat in the country with a Church; it is a very delightful place and called <HI>San Mamma;</HI> the Church is neat, Paved with Mar|ble, and the Walls lined with the &s;ame, but kept in bad repair.

The Inhabitants of <HI>Nixia</HI> have great fewds among them&s;elves, &s;o that they &s;peak not to one another as long as they live; but the Women are more ob&s;tinate than the Men, and are very great medlers in other Peoples Bu&s;ine&s;s.

This I&s;le is fourteen miles in Circuit: There are many Ports about the&s;e little I&s;lands, inhabited only by Coneys, where the Cor&s;ars commonly go. a little farther off is the I&s;land of <HI>Mycone,</HI> heretofore <HI>Myconus,</HI> which was well Peopled,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mycone.</NOTE> but at pre&s;ent is almo&s;t for&s;aken, becau&s;e of the rigorous Per&s;ecution of the Turks; it is thirty miles in Circuit.

There are &s;everal Ca&s;tles in this I&s;le; and fir&s;t the Ca&s;tle of St. <HI>Nicholas,</HI> &s;tanding on a point of the I&s;land. This is a frightful place, for be&s;ides that it is very high; the Hou&s;es of it are built upon the hanging &s;ides of black and burn'd Rocks. A Greek Bi&s;hop has his re&s;idence there, and a matter of five hundred Souls about him, but mo&s;t of them live in Caves that they have made under Ground, which is very light, and ea&s;ie to be Dug, being all Pumice-&s;tone; and it is very plea&s;ant to &s;ee Plowed Lands and People living underneath them, &s;o that the Men come creeping out like Coneys. But Scaro is a Ca&s;tle far more Ga&s;tly than that of St. <HI>Nicholas,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Scaro.</NOTE> not only for the height, but &s;olitude of the Place; and tho&s;e that go up to it, mu&s;t climb with Hands and Feet, and have a &s;pecial care too, lea&s;t &s;ome great Stone fall from on high and knock them down; for one cannot &s;hun it by turning back. This Ca&s;tle contains about an hundred and fifty hou&s;es, built round a Rock that overlooks them; upon which heretofore were &s;everal hou&s;es; and the Greeks, have &s;till a Church there, which formerly belonged to the Latins, where|in there are two Images of Ma&s;&s;ive Silver the one of our Lady, and the other of St. <HI>Michael.</HI> That Rock is &s;upported by walls, for fear it &s;hould fall upon the hou&s;es; for if &s;o, it would &s;mother all the Inhabitants, who are about five hundred in number. The Latin Bi&s;top lives in that place. Half-way betwixt <HI>Scaro</HI> and another Ca&s;tle called <HI>Pirgo,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Pirgo.</NOTE> there is a Chappel of our Lady, with many large Caves, where about two hundred People live. But in going from <HI>Scaro</HI> to <HI>Pirgo,</HI> there is a Hill to be mounted with great pain, from whence one has a view of the whole I&s;land, and the Plain cultivated and Plan|ted with Vines, but few Trees, unle&s;s it be Fig-Trees, and white Mulberry-Trees. Their Vineyards afford them wine enough for the u&s;e of all the Inha|bitants, and &s;ome more, which they &s;ell to their Neighbours, who come and Export it. It is carried to <HI>Chio, Smyrna,</HI> and other Places: They make all &s;orts of Stuffs of which they rai&s;e Money to pay their Tribute. In this place there are a thou&s;and Souls almo&s;t all Greeks, and there the <HI>Cady</HI> Re&s;ides.

At <HI>Scaro</HI> there is a Mona&s;tery of Nuns of the Latin rite, and the Order of St. <HI>Dominick,</HI> but they are ill lodged, becau&s;e the place is narrow, and the Air bad.

A woman that in Ancient times lived upon that Hill, gave Victuals to all the People for a whole year that a Plague and Fa|mine la&s;ted; and it is probable the&s;e Statues have been erected in honour of that good Lady.

with great Veneration they carry home to their Hou&s;es; and the rea&s;on why they do &s;o, is perhaps, becau&s;e they have not a bit of Wood, but have it brought from <HI>Nio,</HI> and buy it by the pound. They have no Fle&s;h, if it be not miraculou&s;ly brought them by &s;ome Raven; they have neverthele&s;s &s;ome Cat|tel which furni&s;h them with a little Chee&s;e: As for Fi&s;h they can have none, be|cau&s;e the Sea about them has no bottom. Some wild Fowl and Eggs they have, but it is a hard labour to climb up and down the&s;e difficult and craggy Rocks. Salt meats are relicts to them, and they feed on nothing but Beans, Pea&s;e, Eggs and Bisket. They have very little or no Fruit at all, unle&s;s it be Grapes, of which they have enough in the Sea&s;on. They know not what Phy&s;icians, Chi|rurgeons, Apothecaries, and men of that profe&s;&s;ion are. They are very &s;tout, and can defend them&s;elves from their Enemies with Stones, e&s;pecially at <HI>Scaro,</HI> where one &s;ingle man may beat down as many as he plea&s;es. They who &s;tay at home in the I&s;land, lead a bea&s;tly life; for they do nothing but eat, drink, &s;leep, and play at Cards. This is all that can be &s;aid of that I&s;land, which looks like Hell; for the Sea in the Harbour and about the Coa&s;t is black, and all &s;eems Burn'd and Scorched, by rea&s;on of a little Rockie I&s;land which appearing about three&s;core Years ago, vomited up incredible Flames; which left &s;o deep a hole there, that when a Stone is thrown into it, it is never heard fall to the bottom. But there happened &s;omething el&s;e &s;ince in that Port, which is no le&s;s wonderful, and I &s;hall relate it according as I had it from &s;everal hands in &s;everal places.</P>
<P>One <HI>Sunday</HI> night about eighteen years agoe,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An extraor|dinary Acci|cident at <HI>San|torini</HI></NOTE> an exceeding great Noi&s;e be|gan in the Port of <HI>Santorini,</HI> which was heard as far off as <HI>Chio,</HI> two hundred miles di&s;tant; but in &s;uch a manner, that at <HI>Chio</HI> it was thought that the Vene|tian and Turki&s;h Fleets were Engaged, which made all People run up the next Morning to the highe&s;t places, to &s;ee what might be &s;een; and I remember the Reverend Father <HI>Bernard,</HI> Superiour of the Capucins of <HI>Chio,</HI> a venerable Per&s;on, and of great Credit, told me that he had been mi&s;taken as well as others, for he thought he had heard Guns as well as they; in the mean time there was nothing to be &s;een; and indeed it was only a Fire that brake out at the bottom of the Sea, in the Port of <HI>Santorini,</HI> and wrought &s;uch effects, that from Morning till Night, va&s;t numbers of Pumice Stones were ca&s;t up out of the Sea, with &s;o great cracking and noi&s;e, that one would have &s;aid they had been &s;o many Cannon-Shot; and that &s;o infected the Air, that in the I&s;le of <HI>Santorini</HI> many Died, and &s;everal lo&s;t their Sight; which neverthele&s;s, they recovered again &s;ome days after.

The Pumice-&s;tones that were ca&s;t up there, &s;o covered the Sea of the <HI>Archipe|lago,</HI> that for &s;ome time when certain Winds blew, Harbours were &s;top'd up with them; in&s;omuch, that the lea&s;t Barque that was could not get out, unle&s;s tho&s;e that are on Board, with Poles made way through the Pumice-&s;tones; and there are of them &s;till to be &s;een all over the Mediterranean Sea, but in &s;mall quantity, now they are di&s;per&s;ed up and down. <HI>Seneca</HI> in one of his Epi&s;tles &s;ays, that <HI>Santorini</HI> &s;tands upon Mines of Sulphur; and from them certainly the Fire proceeds.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Policandre.</NOTE>THE I&s;le of <HI>Policandre</HI> is eight miles in compa&s;s; and a pretty plea&s;ant place: Three miles from the Sea-&s;ide, there is a Village of about an hun|dred Hou&s;es, inhabited by three hundred Souls; one mu&s;t cro&s;s over a Valley and Rocks in going to it, and there are no other Hou&s;es in the I&s;land: In it there are three well built Churches, and two Mona&s;teries, one of Men, and another of Women. The Convent of the Monks is very well &s;ituated, and is dedicated to the Ble&s;&s;ed Virgin; it hath a little Garden adjoyning to the Church, with a Ci&s;tern of excellent water; and in that Garden there is a Statue without a Head, made after the Apo&s;tolick way; there are others al&s;o in the Walls, built in among the re&s;t of the &s;tones. The other Mona&s;tery is for Women, who ob&s;erve no rule or in&s;titution, but live as Nature teaches them; their Church is dedicated to St. <HI>John,</HI> and a Monk &s;ays Ma&s;s in it on all <HI>Sundays</HI> and Holy-days. The Inhabitants of this I&s;le pay their Tribute with the Money they rai&s;e from Barley, Cotton, Stuffs, and Chee&s;e which they make. The Ca&s;tle &s;tands upon a very high Hill, but all the Hou&s;es of it are ruinous, except a Chapel of St. <HI>Michael</HI> the Arch-Angel; from thence one may &s;ee all the I&s;les of the <HI>Archi|pelago.</HI> The Inhabitants of this place are hone&s;t, civil and courteous People, e&s;pecially the Women, who are very hand&s;ome; they live pretty well, having very good Bread, Fowl, Sheep, and other things nece&s;&s;ary: They make no Wine, but have it brought them from <HI>Santorini,</HI> which is but thirty miles from it. They have no Phy&s;icians nor Chyrurgeons, nor any &s;ort of Trade. The Har|bour of this I&s;land is indifferent good, but the <HI>Mainots</HI> and other <HI>Cor&s;airs</HI> put often in there, and lodge a-&s;hore in a Church that &s;tands by the Sea-&s;ide.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Milo.</NOTE>The I&s;le of <HI>Milo</HI> is &s;o called from <HI>Mylos,</HI> which in the vulgar Greek &s;ignifies a Mill, becau&s;e there are many Windmills in it, and becau&s;e al&s;o they bring Mill-&s;tones from thence. This I&s;land is thirty &s;ix miles about, has few Hills in it, and is fruitful in all things, &s;elling yearly betwixt three and four hundred Tun of Wine, and the Inhabitants trade in <HI>Candie, Venice,</HI> and other places. They have a Mine of Brim&s;tone, and much Pumice-&s;tones, which are Let out to one of the Inhabitants, for fifteen hundred Pia&s;tres a year. Three miles from the Town, there are hot Baths of Sulphur, where People come from &s;everal places to wa&s;h, and many recover their health there. The Port is &s;ix miles long, three over, and has a good depth of water. Two miles from this Port, there is a Grotto in form of a large Chamber, wherein there is luke-warm water,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Bath of hot Water that reaches &s;ix miles.</NOTE> which gives &s;o much heat, that an artificial Bath cannot make one &s;weat more. They &s;ay, that the water of this Grott has an inrercour&s;e with the Church of St. <HI>Con&s;tantine,</HI> that is &s;ix miles North of it; and to make a proof of this, one day they put a Silver Cup into this Bath, which they found again in the Fountain of the &s;aid Church of St. <HI>Con&s;tantine.</HI> In this I&s;le, there is a Town where two thou|&s;and five hundred Souls live; and an old Ca&s;tle, inhabited by five hundred more: The Town &s;tands in a Plain, with a Ca&s;tle in the middle of it, but not inhabi|ted. They have a Latin Bi&s;hop, and a Greek Bi&s;hop; the Latin Cathedral is without the Town, dedicated to St. <HI>Peter,</HI> but without any Ornaments, and the Latin Bi&s;hop celebrates in a Chapel that joyns to one of the Greek Churches; this Bi&s;hop has a great many Tithes, which he divides with the Greek Bi&s;hop, taking two thirds to him&s;elf, and giving the Greek the other third. The Greek Bi&s;hop hath &s;everal well built Churches in good repair, and many Prie&s;ts to officiate in them. Mo&s;t of the Inhabitants of this I&s;land are <HI>Greeks,</HI> who live much at their ea&s;e, are civil, but very wicked and perfidious. Their Women go in a very ugly dre&s;s, &s;peak very ill, and cannot pronounce the letter (L) They are very charitable and kind to Strangers. The People live here commodiou&s;ly

There are no Turks in this I&s;land, and it is governed by four Deputies of the Town. Half a mile from <HI>Milo,</HI> is the I&s;le called <HI>Chimolo</HI> or <HI>Argentara,</HI> which hath a good Harbour,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chimolo, <HI>or</HI> Argentara.</NOTE> and a Village containing about two hundred Souls, which was burnt by the Cor&s;airs in the Year 1638. The&s;e poor People live in great mi&s;ery.</P>
<P>The I&s;le of <HI>Sifanto</HI> or <HI>Sifano,</HI> anciently <HI>Sifanus,</HI> is thirty &s;ix miles in circuit,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sifanto, Si|fanus.</NOTE> and has a Ca&s;tle upon a Hill, with double Walls, inhabited by three thou&s;and Souls, and there are no other Hou&s;es in all the I&s;land, unle&s;s it be &s;ome Coun|trey-hou&s;es of private Men: There is no water in this Ca&s;tle, what they have, is brought out of the Plain underneath it. The Harbour is not good for Barks, and therefore they have Ware-hou&s;es near the &s;hore, where they put their Com|modities, and then draw the Barks on Land. There is another good Harbour, but it is five miles from thence. This I&s;le belonged formerly to the Family of <HI>Gozadini,</HI> as may be &s;een by an In&s;cription made in the Year 1450.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Family of the <HI>Gozadini.</HI></NOTE> upon a Marble-Pillar at the entry into the Port. There is upon it a Latin Bi&s;hop, and a Greek Vicar; but the Chapel of the Latin Bi&s;hop is little, and very poor: There is a Mona&s;tery of Greeks al&s;o, built upon a Hill. There is no place of Recreation in this I&s;land, nor any other Antiquity, but a great Che&s;t of white Marble with Oxes Heads, Fe&s;tons, and Fruits upon it. This I&s;le produces not Pro|vi&s;ions for above two months in the year, and for the re&s;t of the year, the Inhabi|tants provide them&s;elves el&s;ewhere, having little Barks for that end, which they build upon the place. They &s;ay, that they have a Mine of Lead, and a Gold Mine: They are very rogues, but their Women are very hone&s;t, and go with their faces covered. There are no Trades there, but Weavers, Shoe|makers, Joyners, and the like.</P>
<P>The I&s;le of <HI>Thermia</HI> is thirty &s;ix miles in circuit, and &s;o called from <HI>Therma,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Thermia.</NOTE> which in the Greek &s;ignifies Hot; becau&s;e of the Springs of hot water that are in a Plain there near the Sea, from which the &s;ick and indi&s;po&s;ed receive much relief. The Town contains about three hundred Hou&s;es, inhabited by about two thou&s;and Souls; there are fifteen Greek Churches in it, and a Greek Bi&s;hop, who re&s;ides &s;ix months of the year at <HI>Zia,</HI> and the other &s;ix at <HI>Thermia.</HI> Heretofore there was a Latin Bi&s;hop there, but he having gone out of the I&s;land, the <HI>Albanians</HI> u&s;urped all, there being no Inventory nor other Writing to be found. There is nothing remarkable in it, but the afore-mentioned Baths, though there be a Ca&s;tle there, and a pretty big Village, called <HI>Me&s;i.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Me&s;i.</NOTE> This I&s;land is almo&s;t all a Plain, has few Trees, and yet it is fruitful and abundant in all things. The Inhabitants are hone&s;t people, and trade in Stuffs, Thread, and other Commodities, rai&s;ing thereby Money to pay their Tribute. Turki&s;h Money pa&s;&s;es not there, but only the Coyn of <HI>Venice,</HI> &s;o as in &s;everal other &s;uch I&s;les, except <HI>Naxia, Andro,</HI> and <HI>Seyra,</HI> where Turki&s;h Money goes. The Women of <HI>Thermia,</HI> are vertuous, hand&s;ome, and wear a neat dre&s;s. The People live pretty well there, and a <HI>Cady</HI> commands, with four Procurators cho&s;en among the Citizens of the Town.</P>
<P><HI>Ajora</HI> is a little I&s;le, eighteen miles about; it depends on the I&s;le of <HI>Scyra,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ajora.</NOTE> who&s;e Inhabitants keep &s;ome Shepherds there to look after their Sheep. There are four Churches in it, where Divine-Service is performed but once a year, to wit, at <HI>Ea&s;ter,</HI> and then the Shepherds Communicate. It is not at all cultivated, becau&s;e the Cor&s;airs carry off the Oxen, and &s;ometimes the Sheep al&s;o.</P>
<P>The I&s;le of <HI>Scyra,</HI> which in the vulgar Greek &s;ignifies <HI>Signora,</HI> or Mi&s;tre&s;s,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Scyra.</NOTE> is &s;o called, becau&s;e by its height it commands all the other I&s;les, being almo&s;t in the middle of them: It is thirty &s;ix miles in circuit, a dry Soyl, bears few Trees, and neverthele&s;s abounds in all things, having plenty of Provi&s;ions, Fle&s;h, Fi&s;h, and Veni&s;on. The Water they u&s;e, is brought from a Spring a little wide of the Town, and is very good. They have no Villages of any con|&s;equence, only &s;ome &s;cattering Hou&s;es in the Countrey. The Inhabitans of this I&s;le are much given to devotion, and chiefly the Women, who are very &s;illy. There is much hatred and envy always among them, which ari&s;es from the oppre&s;&s;ion they daily &s;uffer from the Turks, and their common poverty. They are almo&s;t all Latins, and have &s;everal Churches, the Cathedral &s;tanding

<P>AFter I had long waited for a Pa&s;&s;age to <HI>Aegyt,</HI> an occca&s;ion (at length) offered of a great <HI>Saique</HI> bound for <HI>Ro&s;&s;etto.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Saiques.</NOTE> The&s;e <HI>Saiques</HI> are like great Barks, having a round hulk, and a very big and high Main-ma&s;t. They carry great Cargoes of Goods, but they &s;ail not fa&s;t, unle&s;s they be before the Wind, or rather they &s;ail no otherwi&s;e, for they cannot go upon a Wind. The <HI>Greeks</HI> make u&s;e of no other Ve&s;&s;els for trading both in the White and Black Seas, and that's the rea&s;on there are &s;o many of them; though the Chri&s;tian Cor&s;airs pick up &s;everal of them now and then. I &s;pake to the Ma&s;ter of this <HI>Saique,</HI> who was a <HI>Janizary,</HI> and he promi&s;ed to give me notice when the weather was fair to &s;et out; but that I might be the more at ea&s;e, I hired the Pur&s;ers Cabin in the top of the Poop, which was &s;o little, that when my Man and I turn'd in, there was not half a foot of room to &s;pare. I then be&s;tir'd my &s;elf &s;peedily to make my provi&s;ions, not forgetting a <HI>Capot</HI> for my &s;elf, and another for my Man. A <HI>Capot</HI> is a certain Field-garment,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Capot.</NOTE> lined through with the &s;ame &s;tuff it is made of, and &s;haped like a Wa&s;tcoat, reaching down to the knee; there are &s;leeves for the arms, and a hood fa&s;tened to it for the head. All the Sea-men have Capots, and it &s;eems to me to be &s;o nece&s;&s;ary an Implement, not only for Sea-men, but for all that travel by Sea, that I cannot &s;ee how in a long Voyage, one can be without it: In ca&s;e of nece&s;&s;ity, it will &s;erve for a Quilt and Co|verlet: With a Capot, you may &s;it down and lye where you plea&s;e, and without it you would pitch all your cloaths: rain or blow, you may walk abroad in the air with your Capot; and within a Capot, you need neither fear wet nor cold I found &s;o much good in this Garment, and have received &s;o many Ser|vices from it, that I thought I could not but here &s;ay &s;omething in prai&s;e of it. Being then provided with all things nece&s;&s;ary for a pretty long Voyage (though they gave me hopes that in eight or ten days time I &s;hould be in <HI>Aegypt</HI>) I went on board on <HI>Wedne&s;day</HI> the Fifteenth of <HI>November,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Departure from <HI>Chio.</HI></NOTE> about three a clock in the Afternoon, and an hour after, we &s;et out of the Port of <HI>Chio</HI> with a North|wind.

who may make in all three thou&s;and Souls, very poor, and ill clad. They are much addicted to Swimming, and fi&s;hing up Sponges from the bottom of the Sea, or the Goods of Ships that have been ca&s;t away; and Batchelours are not married in this I&s;land, unle&s;s they can dive at lea&s;t eight fathom deep into the water, and of this they mu&s;t give proof: So that when a Papas, or any other of the riche&s;t men of the I&s;land, would marry his Daughter,<NOTE PLACE="marg">To whom the Maids are married at <HI>Nicaria.</HI></NOTE> he pitches upon a day whereon he promi&s;es his Daughter to the be&s;t Swimmer; and the day being come, the young Men &s;trip them&s;elves &s;tark naked before all the People, the Maid her&s;elf being pre&s;ent, and throw them&s;elves into the water, where he that &s;tays longe&s;t under, obtains the Maid in Marriage.

<P>But to return to Sea again, we did what lay in our power to pa&s;s that I&s;land, and take Harbour at <HI>Stanchio;</HI> but a South-ea&s;t wind blowing &s;oon after, hindred us from that; and though we beat and tack'd to and agen till the even|ing, we gained no ground, &s;o that we re&s;olved to turn back again, and did &s;o an hour before night, finding that the South-ea&s;t wind began to blow fre&s;her and fre&s;her. In the Night-time we had much Lightning: However while I was attentively con&s;idering <HI>Samos,</HI> I &s;aw a light on &s;hore,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Light which no bo|dy kindles.</NOTE> which &s;eem'd to me to be a Candle; and having ask'd an hone&s;t <HI>Roman</HI> Catholick of <HI>Chio</HI> (with whom I had made friend&s;hip) what it was? He made me an&s;wer, That that Light was &s;een every night in the &s;ame place; that having pa&s;t that way ten or twelve times in the night-time, he had always &s;een it; that neverthele&s;s there was neither Hou&s;e nor Tree there; that many had gone oftentimes in &s;earch of it, but could never find it, &s;eeing it very well at a di&s;tance, but lo&s;ing &s;ight of it a&s;&s;oon as they came near; and that about the place where the Light is &s;een, there is an ancient Chri&s;tian Church all ruinous, which makes people think that there is &s;ome My&s;tery in it. I thought the man had jeer'd me, when he told me all the&s;e things, and therefore I went to the Captain's Cabin, where having asked him the &s;ame que&s;tion (though he was a Turk) he told me the &s;ame things the hone&s;t <HI>Chiot</HI> did, who was Patron of the <HI>Saique,</HI> and a Greek, which made me more attentively con&s;ider that Light; I ey'd it for the &s;pace of an hour, and it &s;eemed to me to be about two hundred paces from the Sea-&s;ide, on that part of the I&s;land which looks We&s;tward, oppo&s;ite to the I&s;le of <HI>Nacaria</HI> or <HI>Nicaria:</HI> I &s;aw it ri&s;e and fall like a Candle, and I remember that the Monks of <HI>Niamoni,</HI> of the I&s;le of <HI>Chio,</HI> told me ju&s;t &s;uch another thing, concerning the Foundation of their Church. Having well con&s;idered that Light, I went to &s;leep about eleven of the clock, and the wind blew fre&s;her about mid|night, with &s;o thick a darkne&s;s, that one could not &s;ee &s;ix &s;teps on head; and in the mean time we were in a dangerous place, betwixt <HI>Samos</HI> and <HI>Nicaria,</HI> &s;o that we had cau&s;e to fear the <HI>Saique</HI> might run foul of one of the&s;e two places. There fell afterward a great deal of rain, but &s;uch &s;trong gu&s;ts of wind with it, as gave the Sea-men enough to do; and be&s;ides that, we had great claps of Thunder, which doubling horribly betwixt the&s;e I&s;lands, made with the beating of the waves, a fearful noi&s;e: In the mean time the Ship made much water, which created no &s;mall trouble to the Sea-men, who had already their hands full on't. Another danger threatned us be&s;ides, for they had left the <HI>Caique</HI> in the Sea, towed at the <HI>Saiques</HI> &s;tern, which being forced by the violence of the wind, knock'd its head &s;o hard again&s;t the <HI>Saique,</HI> that it might have &s;tarted a plank, and &s;unk her down to rights, many Ve&s;&s;els being lo&s;t &s;o, even in the Port; neverthele&s;s their was no hoi&s;ting of it up, though it had &s;trucken &s;o

often again&s;t the <HI>Saique</HI> that all the Head of it was broken, and the <HI>Saique</HI> was &s;o &s;lippery that there was no holding on her; &s;o that at &s;everal times three Men fell into the Sea, but Ropes being quickly thrown out to them, they were drawn up again: At length came day, but with it &s;o thick a Fog, that it was more than three Hours after before we could &s;ee Land. We afterward di&s;co|vered <HI>Chio,</HI> about ten a Clock in the Morning, and put into Harbour the &s;ame day being <HI>Friday,</HI> the &s;eventeenth of <HI>November,</HI> a little after Noon. Our Captain perceiving the Weather to be contrary to us,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Scala Nuova <HI>or</HI> Cou&s;chada&s;i.</NOTE> propo&s;ed to go and An|chor in the Port of <HI>Scala Nuova,</HI> which the Turks call <HI>Cou&s;chada&s;i,</HI> and I ear|ne&s;tly de&s;ired it; becau&s;e then I might have gone to <HI>Ephe&s;us,</HI> which is but half a days Journey from it, but &s;ome <HI>Chiots</HI> told him, that it was dangerous en|tring into the Port of <HI>Scala Nuova</HI> at that time.

<P>WE waited with great Impatience for fair Weather at <HI>Chio,</HI> neverthele&s;s the South-Ea&s;t Wind continued blowing till <HI>Tue&s;day,</HI> the Twenty eighth of <HI>November,</HI> when with day a North-Wind aro&s;e; we let not &s;lip the occa&s;ion, for being got on Board, we put out the &s;ame day about Four a Clock in the Afternoon, and <HI>Wedne&s;day</HI> the Twenty ninth of <HI>November,</HI> pa&s;t by <HI>Samos</HI> about Midnight. In the Morning the Wind abated a little, and neverthele&s;s, about One of the Clock we arrived at <HI>Stanchio,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Stanchio, <HI>or</HI> I&s;ola Longa.</NOTE> otherwi&s;e called <HI>I&s;ola Longa,</HI> Four&s;core and ten Miles from <HI>Samos,</HI> and came to an Anchor to take in Fre&s;h-Water. We who were Chri&s;tians went not a Shoar, becau&s;e there were Eight hundred <HI>Spahis</HI> lately arrived, to defend that I&s;land again&s;t the <HI>Venetians;</HI> and &s;eeing the&s;e Blades play'd the Devil and all, putting their Hor&s;es into the Churches of the <HI>Greeks,</HI> they would certainly have abu&s;ed us, being then extreamly Exa&s;perated again&s;t all <HI>Franks.</HI> This I&s;land, called heretofore <HI>Coos,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Coos. Lango.</NOTE> and named at pre&s;ent by the Turks <HI>Stanchio,</HI> and by the <HI>Franks, Lango,</HI> or <HI>I&s;ola Longa,</HI> is Seventy Miles in Circuit, and is very Fruitful, e&s;pecially in good Wine; the Country &s;eems to be plea&s;ant enough, and upon the Port by the Sea-&s;ide there is a Ca&s;tle, that makes a pretty good &s;hew: The Town lies backwards,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Tree of an extraordina|ry extent.</NOTE> and &s;eems to be no great matter; there is a Tree there of a va&s;t extent, and ca&s;ts a prodigious &s;hadow. It can ea&s;ily cover Two thou&s;and Men, and the Branches of it are &s;upported by &s;everal Stone and Wooden Pillars, there being under it &s;everal Barbers Shops, Coffee-Hou&s;es, and &s;uch like places, with many Benches to &s;it on. This Tree is like a Sycamore, but that it bears a fruit like a Che&s;nut, and &s;erves for Tanning of Leather. There was in Anci|ent Times in this I&s;land, a famous Temple of <HI>Ae&s;culapius,</HI> and it is al&s;o Illu&s;tri|ous,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hippocrates. Apelles.</NOTE> for having been the Native Country of <HI>Hippocrates,</HI> the Prince of Phy&s;i|tians; and of <HI>Apelles,</HI> the Prince of Painters. The Knights of <HI>Malta</HI> held this I&s;land, when they were Ma&s;ters of <HI>Rhodes,</HI> and I was told, that there were &s;till many of their Monuments there. Having taken in Water at <HI>Stanchio,</HI> the &s;ame day after Sun-&s;et, we &s;et Sail, with a North-wind that &s;oon &s;lackened. Next day being <HI>Thur&s;day,</HI> the Thirtieth of <HI>November,</HI> betwixt Nine and Ten a Clock in the Morning, he that look'd out, made a Sail coming towards us from <HI>Rhodes;</HI> we thought it might be a Cor&s;ar of <HI>Malta,</HI> and &s;hortly after,
<PB N="113" REF="76">
we found we were not mi&s;taken, and therefore we &s;tood back again with a South-we&s;t Wind, which blew very fre&s;h, and came to an Anchor at <HI>Bodrou,</HI> for we would not put back again to <HI>Stanchio,</HI> becau&s;e Ve&s;&s;els are not &s;ecure there from the South-ea&s;t Wind.</P>
<P><HI>Bodrou</HI> is a Ca&s;tle on the Main Land, over again&s;t the I&s;le of <HI>Stanchio,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Bodrou.</NOTE> which is but Twelve Miles from it. There is a good Port there, &s;hut in on all hands, and the entry to it is by the South-we&s;t, but the Turks have &s;uf|fered it (with the time) to be filled up with Dirt; &s;o that now there is no Water there for great Ve&s;&s;els. Next Morning, <HI>Friday</HI> the Fir&s;t of <HI>December,</HI> we went a Shoar, and bought &s;ome fre&s;h Provi&s;ions in the Ca&s;tle.</P>
<P>There are &s;even Gates to be pa&s;&s;ed, before one can enter into this place. Over every Gate there are &s;everal Coats of Arms, which perhaps, are the Arms of tho&s;e who Commanded in that place, whil&s;t it belonged to the Knights of <HI>Rhodes,</HI> for in &s;ome of them there are Cro&s;&s;es of <HI>Malta,</HI> and the Walls are covered all over with &s;uch, there being (as I take it) above Three hundred E&s;cutcheons, which appear to be newly made. Having pa&s;&s;ed the &s;econd Gate, there is on the Right Hand a Statue of an Armed Man upon the Ground, but it wants the Head, and upon the Wall over it &s;ome Ba&s;s-Reliefs very well cut. Over the third Gate, in the in-&s;ide, under &s;ome Coat of Arms is this In&s;cription, <HI>Propter fidem Catholicam tenemus locum i&s;tum,</HI> and &s;ome more which I could not read: Then on the Right Hand, there is cut on a lovely Stone in the Wall, <HI>Sarreboure,</HI> 1130. There are many other pieces in Ba&s;s-Relief, and Coats of Arms in &s;everal places upon the Wall that is beaten by the Sea; and among others, there is one bearing a Fortre&s;s, and under it the&s;e words: F. <HI>Con&s;tantius de ope|ribus cardinalibus;</HI> there are al&s;o three Demy Lions i&s;&s;uant out of the Wall, from the Head to half the Body. Betwixt the fourth and fifth Gates on the Right Hand, there are Ba&s;s-Reliefs of Men fighting, among which there is &s;omething written in <HI>Lingua Franca,</HI> but I could read nothing of it but 1510. Over the &s;ixth Gate, on the out-&s;ide there are three E&s;cutcheons, under which are the&s;e words: <HI>Salva nos Domine vigilantes, cu&s;todi nos dormientes, ni&s;i Domi|nus aedificaverit civitatem fru&s;tra vigilat qui cu&s;todit eam.</HI> Then you come to a Platform, where there are &s;ix Cannons that play towards the Sea. Over the &s;eventh Gate al&s;o on the out&s;ide, there are three E&s;cutcheons, and over the &s;ame Gate on the in&s;ide, the &s;ame three E&s;cutcheons, with two words written in <HI>Gothick</HI> Characters, which I could not read. Under this la&s;t Gate, which is of Iron, there is a Court of Guard, of fifteen or twenty Men. This is a good &s;trong Ca&s;tle, the Walls are very high, and built of a kind of Stone, that great Guns cannot hurt it: It is beaten by the Sea on one &s;ide, and there are Port-holes in the Wall along the Sea-&s;ide, which being Mounted with Cannon could ea&s;ily hinder Ships from approaching it. It is very &s;trong al&s;o towards the Land, and all the Walls are &s;o &s;ound, that they &s;eem as if they had been but lately built. Hor&s;e cannot wrong it, for it &s;tands upon a Rock, in a ri&s;ing place, where the Land is very narrow, being on two &s;ides encompa&s;&s;ed by the Sea; which (as I &s;aid) on one hand wa&s;hes the foot of the Ca&s;tle, and is not half a Mile from the other &s;ide. This Ca&s;tle, however, might ea&s;ily be taken, by cutting off the Water that is brought to it by an Aqueduct; for though there be Ci&s;terns in it, yet the Turks have &s;uffered them to be &s;o filled up with Earth, that they are u&s;ele&s;s. Among the Hou&s;es that are &s;omewhat Ruinous, there are a great many pieces of Pillars. There are many Hou&s;es al&s;o without the Ca&s;tle, but no body lives in them; in the Evening all and even the Cattle, retire into the Ca&s;tle. The Country about is very fruitful in Grapes, Figs, and &s;uch like Fruit. This is all that I could ob&s;erve of this Ca&s;tle, where I dur&s;t not eye any thing but in pa&s;&s;ing, for fear of being taken for a Spie, for when I &s;topt any where, the Turks took notice of me.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. LXXII.</HI> Our Departure from <HI>Bodrou,</HI> and our Arrival at <HI>Rhodes.</HI></HEAD>
<P>WE &s;tay'd &s;ome days at <HI>Bodrou,</HI> becau&s;e a &s;trong South-we&s;t Wind blew &s;till, with much Rain. <HI>Sunday,</HI> the third of <HI>December,</HI> it began to blow a little from North-north-We&s;t, but it la&s;ted not; however we put out on <HI>Monday,</HI> the fourth of <HI>December,</HI> betwixt three and four in the Afternoon, with an ea&s;ie North-north-We&s;t Gale, which la&s;ted not three Hours, but left us becalmed, until <HI>Tue&s;day</HI> the fifth of <HI>December,</HI> that blowing pretty hard from South-ea&s;t, we were forced to put back again. We came to an Anchor before <HI>Stanchio,</HI> for the Wind was contrary for carrying us to <HI>Bodrou.</HI> We put out four An|chors, that we might ride &s;ecure from that South-ea&s;t Wind, which made us dance bravely, but notwith&s;tanding all our Anchors, we &s;uffered much by the Storm. For my part I &s;trained my very Guts almo&s;t out with Vomiting and Reaching, and when that was over, I had &s;uch violent pains in my Side, that I thought they would have killed me; and then notwith&s;tanding my pain, I could not forbear to blame a little tho&s;e, who out of a de&s;ire of Travelling for&s;ake their ea&s;e, and die of the lea&s;t Indi&s;po&s;ition they fall into, for want of help.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Opium.</NOTE> A Turk taking pitty of me, gave me <HI>Opium</HI> to eat; not knowing what it was, I &s;wallowed it down, but when he would have had me take another Do&s;e, I asked him what it was, and he made an&s;wer, Eat it, it is good for you, it is <HI>Opium.</HI> Then I told him that he had Poy&s;oned me, and &s;training a little, I Vomited again. Since I was not the only &s;ick per&s;on aboard, and that all had trouble enough, the Wind blowing very hard, and Raining whole Nights, we &s;everal times weighed Anchor, and did what we could to get to <HI>Bodrou,</HI> but all in vain, for the South-ea&s;t Wind &s;till hindred us. At length, on <HI>Saturday</HI> the ninth of <HI>December,</HI> the Wind changed, and after Noon we had a breeze from North, but we did not offer to &s;et Sail before next day, that we might &s;ee if it was like to continue. Next day being <HI>Sunday,</HI> the tenth of <HI>December,</HI> it blowing fre&s;her from North, we &s;et Sail about Eleven a Clock in the Forenoon; but that Wind la&s;ted not long, for about Two in the After|noon, it began to calm, and at Night chopt about to the South; but it did not blow hard, and therefore we &s;till kept under Sail. About Ten a Clock at Night we run a Ri&s;que, which we had not fore&s;een: For we being above thirty <HI>Saiques</HI> in company, and the Night very dark, about ten of the Clock, a <HI>Saique</HI> ran foul of us, and entangled his Fore-ma&s;t with our Main-ma&s;t; the Bounce made &s;o great a noi&s;e, that we all thought our &s;elves lo&s;t; and every one running out to &s;ee what the matter was, &s;ome of our Men took a good Rope and la&s;hed the Fore-ma&s;t of that <HI>Saique</HI> to ours, whil&s;t four or five went down with a Lant|horn to the Pomp, to &s;ee if our <HI>Saique</HI> had &s;prung a Leak, or &s;uffered damage in the Hold, the re&s;t &s;taying above-decks to take heed, that the Sea-men of the other <HI>Saique</HI> did not ca&s;t loo&s;e the Rope and get clear of us; but the poor Creatures (who were all <HI>Greeks</HI>) were &s;o &s;tunned at the fault they had com|mitted, that not one of them appeared. At fir&s;t when this happened, our Captain was &s;o enraged, that he was about to Leap into the other <HI>Saique</HI> with Sword in Hand, and kill all he met; but being quickly better advi&s;ed, he and all the re&s;t re&s;olved, that if our <HI>Saique</HI> was in danger of Sinking, to Leap into theirs, and throwing them all into the Sea, to make them&s;elves Ma&s;ters of her, therefore it was that they held her La&s;hed to ours. At length (God be prai|&s;ed) we found that our <HI>Saique</HI> had received no damage, but only a little of her Side broken. Had it blown a little fre&s;her, or had they &s;truck but a hands breadth lower, our <HI>Saique</HI> had gone to the bottom. We let them go then,
<PB N="115" REF="77">
without doing them any hurt, though there were &s;ome on board of us, who gave advice to fire a Broad-&s;ide into her and &s;ink her.</P>
<P>In the mean time, the &s;ame South-Wind &s;till continuing, we kept beating to and again till <HI>Monday,</HI> the elventh of <HI>December,</HI> when two Hours before Night, we manned our Boat to tow us into a narrow pa&s;&s;age, which is betwixt the I&s;le of <HI>Sanbiki,</HI> by the Turks called <HI>Sunbiki,</HI> and another inhabited I&s;land; we came to an Anchor there about Sun-&s;etting. This is a very narrow place, and pretty &s;ecure from Winds; when you are pa&s;&s;ed the &s;treight, there is a Village upon the Sea-&s;ide, where none but <HI>Greeks</HI> live, who Trade up and down in <HI>Sanbikis,</HI> by the Turks called <HI>Sunbikis,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Sunbikis.</NOTE> which were fir&s;t invented and made in this I&s;land. The&s;e Ve&s;&s;els are a kind of Galiotts, which we &s;hall Treat of in another place. We &s;tayed there all that Night, and next day, being <HI>Tue&s;day</HI> the twelfth of <HI>December; Wedne&s;day</HI> the thirteenth of <HI>December,</HI> at break of day, a gentle Gale blowing &s;till from the South, our <HI>Caique</HI> towed us out of the Streight, and then we &s;pread Sail. Betwixt Nine and Ten a Clock, the Wind turned about to North-north-We&s;t, with which we made &s;o good way, that about Three a Clock in the Afternoon we arrived at <HI>Rhodes,</HI> an hundred Miles from <HI>Stanchio.</HI> We lay thirteen days in the Harbour of <HI>Rhodes,</HI> during which time, I con&s;idered that place as much as I could, not daring, however, to eye any thing too attentively; for &s;o &s;oon as I &s;topt, the Turks ob&s;erved me, and a <HI>Chiot</HI> Gentleman with whom I was, jogged me at the &s;ame time, to di|vert me from my Curio&s;ity, which might prove hurtful, e&s;pecially at that time, when in all the I&s;les of <HI>Turkie,</HI> they apprehended a de&s;cent from the <HI>Venetians.</HI></P>

The <HI>Grand Signior</HI> having followed this Coun&s;el, the Town was taken by Compo&s;ition, for the Knights were redu|ced to that pa&s;s, that they were not able to hold out any longer. And indeed, the Great Ma&s;ter received a great deal of Honour by this Siege, having been prai&s;ed by the <HI>Grand Signior</HI> him&s;elf, who both honoured and pittied him, offering him every thing that he &s;tood in need of. This place was &s;urrendred to the Turks about the end of the Year 1522. after it had been kept by the Knights, for the &s;pace of Two hundred and &s;ome odd Years.</P>
<P>The Town hath two Harbours, the one which is the great Port, being &s;quare and &s;pacious enough; but it is not very &s;afe when it blows from Ea&s;t North-ea&s;t, or South-ea&s;t; and we found it bad enough for two days time that a North-Wind blew. When the Knights were in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of that I&s;le, they de&s;igned to have made another in the corner near the Town, by the Ca&s;tle St. <HI>Angelo,</HI> and this would have proved a &s;afe Port from all Winds, but they lo&s;t the place before they could put their de&s;ign in execution. On the right|hand of the entry into the Port, there is a new Tower built by the Turks, in place of the old one, which was called the Tower of St. <HI>Nicholas;</HI> it is &s;quare, has a pretty Dungeon or Plat-form in the upper part of it, and a Sentry-place at each Angle: This Tower is well furni&s;hed with Cannon, it hath a Ba&s;tion adjoyning to it behind, and a Courtine that reaches to the Walls of the Town, and makes one of the &s;ides of the Port: Over again&s;t this Tower, on the other &s;ide of the Port, there is an old Ca&s;tle, which (when the Knights were Ma&s;ters there) was called the Ca&s;tle of St. <HI>Angelo;</HI> but it is &s;omewhat Rui|nous.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Colo&s;&s;us</HI> of the Sun.</NOTE> The Ca&s;tle and Tower, which are above fifty Fathom di&s;tant, are built upon the two places where &s;tood the Feet of that great <HI>Colo&s;&s;us</HI> of Bra&s;s, one of the Seven Wonders of the World; betwixt the Legs of which, Ships pa&s;&s;ed under Sail.

to the Main-Land, whereon there is a Ca&s;tle built, called in time of the Knights, the Ca&s;tle of St. <HI>Erme.</HI> This is a good Harbour, and able to con|tain many Galleys, but the Mouth of it is &s;o narrow, that one Galley only can enter at a time; it looks to the Ea&s;t North-ea&s;t. It's every Night &s;hut with a Chain, that is fa&s;tned to a little Tower, at the farther end of a Mole which runs out Five and twenty or thirty Paces into the Sea, over again&s;t the Ca&s;tle St. <HI>Erme;</HI> the other end of the Chain is made fa&s;t to a piece of Rock on the Shoar, &s;even or eight Paces from the Ca&s;tle St. <HI>Erme.</HI> This Mole I have been &s;peaking of, hath another little Tower on the end of it towards the Land, and hard by about fifty Paces further up on Land; there is a Burying-place, and in it fifteen or twenty Domes of Free-&s;tone well built, mo&s;t of them &s;upported by four Arches; and the&s;e are the Sepulchres of the <HI>Beys,</HI> and other Per&s;ons of Quality in <HI>Rhodes,</HI> who have been killed in the Wars. There is a <HI>Piazza,</HI> or place on the &s;ide of the Galleys Port, with &s;ome Trees and a Fountain in it, and at the end of that place near the bottom of the Port, is the <HI>Ar&s;enal,</HI> where the Galleys and <HI>Saiques</HI> are built. The Town (as I &s;aid) is &s;mall, but very &s;trong; towards the Port it hath high and &s;trong Walls, well planted with Faulcons on the top, and below there are Port-holes for great Cannon. There is be&s;ides over again&s;t the Ba&s;tion, that is betwixt the two Ports, a good Tower with a Ditch, which hath three great pieces of Cannon mounted aloft, that hinder any Ve&s;&s;els from coming near the Port. In the middle of the Fronti&s;piece of this Tower, there is a little Statue of St. <HI>Paul,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Statue of St. <HI>Paul</HI> at <HI>Rhodes.</HI></NOTE> with his Sword, as the In&s;cription by his Head &s;hews; underneath this Statue is the Mitre with the two Keys, which are the Arms of the Church, then underneath that there are three E&s;cutcheons, one of a plain Cro&s;s, another of a Cro&s;s An|chred, and a third in the middle, bearing a Tree, which I know not; It is as &s;trong on the Land-&s;ide, but &s;trangers have le&s;s liberty to view it on that &s;ide, becau&s;e they have le&s;s to do there. This Town hath three Gates, one towards the Sea where Corn is &s;old, and two on the Land-&s;ide, through one of which I pa&s;&s;ed, and it looks towards the Den of the Dragon which was &s;lain by the Knight <HI>Deodat de Gozon;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Deodat de Gozon.</NOTE> as may be &s;een in the Hi&s;tory of the Knights of St. <HI>John;</HI> the Head of the Dragon was heretofore upon that Gate, but &s;ome Years &s;ince, the Turks removed it to the Water-gate. On this &s;ide it was al&s;o that the Traytor <HI>Andrea d'Amaral,</HI> &s;hot &s;ecretly from the Hou&s;e of the Great Ma&s;ter that looks that way, a Letter fa&s;tned to an Arrow into the Camp of the Turks, wherein he gave the Turks notice, that they could not take the Town but on that &s;ide, by filling up the Ditches with the Earth of a Hill that was clo&s;e by; which they did, and &s;o took <HI>Rbodes,</HI> from the &s;ame place the Traytor continued to acquaint the <HI>Grand Signior</HI> with the re&s;olutions of the Council. Near to this Gate within the Town, are the Pits where the Knights put their Corn, &s;uch as they have at pre&s;ent in <HI>Malta,</HI> for the &s;ame u&s;e. As you enter the Town by the Water-gate, you go fir&s;t through a little Gate, over which are two E&s;cutcheons of two Cro&s;&s;es, the one plain and the other Anchred; then to the Left hand you enter by a great Gate, over which is the Dragons Head, which is much Thicker, Broader,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Dragons head at <HI>Rhodes.</HI></NOTE> and Longer than a Hor&s;es Head, the Jaws of it are &s;lit up to the Ears, with very great Teeth on each &s;ide; it is flat above, hath Eyes &s;omewhat bigger than tho&s;e of a Hor&s;e, the hole of the No&s;tril full round, and the Skin of a greyi&s;h White Colour (perhaps becau&s;e of the Du&s;t that &s;ticks to it) and appears to be very hard. There are three E&s;cutcheons over that Gate al&s;o, as there are many others on &s;everal places of the Walls, but one dares not &s;top to look at them. One of the&s;e E&s;cutcheons bears a plain Cro&s;s, and the other a Cro&s;s Anchred; and betwixt the&s;e two there is a third, bearing the Arms of <HI>France.</HI> On the very top of this Gate, there are three Statues in their Niches, with three Lines written underneath them, whereof I could only read the fir&s;t Word, which is <HI>D. Petrus,</HI> and under that In&s;cription are the three above|mentioned E&s;cutcheons. This Gate is betwixt two great Towers, well plan|ted with Faulcons. The Streets of the Town are pretty broad, all Paved with little Stones, and for the mo&s;t part covered with Pent-hou&s;es, which the Turks have made; the&s;e Pent-hou&s;es jet out &s;o far into the Street, that they almo&s;t touch one another in the middle of it: There are &s;everal fair Buildings in it,
<PB N="118" REF="79">
but all built in time of the Knights. St. <HI>John</HI>'s Church is &s;till to be &s;een there, but it is at pre&s;ent a Mo&s;que. There is a little Nich over the great Gate of it, that hath a round cover, and upon that cover, the Figures of our Saviour, the Ble&s;&s;ed Virgin, and St. <HI>John</HI> holding the Cro&s;s, are cut in bas relief. The Gate is of Wood, pretty well carv'd; and on the left hand as you come out of the Church, (into which no Chri&s;tian is now &s;uffered to enter) is the &s;treet of the Knights, where all of them (I believe) lodged; for there are &s;everal Coats of Arms upon the hou&s;es of that &s;treet, out of which there is &s;till a gate to go into St. <HI>John</HI>'s: This is a long &s;treight &s;treet, and mounts upwards; it is paved with &s;mall Stones, and in the middle of the &s;treet there is a line of white Marble a foot broad, which reaches from one end to the other; at the upper end of it, is the Palace of the great Ma&s;ter, but no body now lives in it. None but Turks and Jews live in the City of <HI>Rhodes;</HI> for Chri&s;tians are not &s;uffered to be there, though they keep Shops in the Town, but at night they mu&s;t retire to the Villages in the Countrey about, being only allowed to come to Town in the day-time.</P>

This Gallion rode with four Anchors abroad, yet one night, a little before day, all the Cables broke much at the &s;ame time, which the company that were on board perceiving, fired two Guns for a&s;&s;i&s;tance; but no help being given them, about break of day &s;he &s;plit upon a Rock, all the men that were on board, were &s;aved, except a Turki&s;h Merchant, who would not be &s;aved, &s;aying, that he would not leave his Goods that were in the Gallion; and indeed, he peri&s;hed with the Ship, which was &s;o broken to pieces, that in an hours time there was no more to be &s;een of her. Neverthele&s;s help might have been given them, &s;eeing (notwith&s;tanding the &s;torm) <HI>Caiques</HI> went and came, and all that was to be done, was but to carry them a Cable or two.

<HEAD>CHAP. I. <HI>Of</HI> Alexandria.</HEAD>
<P>IN the former Book, I gave an Account of our arrival at <HI>Alexandria,</HI> after a tedious Voyage, which is commonly performed from <HI>Chio</HI> in &s;even or eight days time. And now being in <HI>Alexandria,</HI> I &s;tay'd &s;ome days for fair weather, that I might go with the <HI>Saique</HI> to <HI>Ro&s;&s;etto;</HI> but perceiving that the wind changed not, and that probably it might be a months time before the <HI>Saique</HI> could get to <HI>Ro&s;&s;etto,</HI> I brought my things a-&s;hore, and re&s;olved to go thither by Land. Before my departure, I &s;aw all that is worth the &s;eeing in <HI>Alexandria.</HI> This Town, called by the Turks <HI>Skenderia,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Alexandria, <HI>or</HI> Skenderia.</NOTE> heretofore &s;o lovely, rich and famous a place, is at pre&s;ent &s;o ruined, that it is no more the &s;ame; there is nothing to be &s;een in it but ruined Hou&s;es ca&s;t one upon ano|ther, and the heaps of Rubbi&s;h and Stones which are on all hands, are higher than the Hou&s;es. The <HI>French</HI> are lodged there in a <HI>Fondick,</HI> which is a great Hou&s;e like a <HI>Han.</HI> There are other <HI>Fondicks</HI> al&s;o for the <HI>Engli&s;h, Dutch, Vene|tians,</HI> and others, and they pay no Hou&s;e-rent; on the contrary, the Con|&s;uls receive Money from the <HI>Grand Signior</HI> yearly, to keep them in nece&s;&s;ary repair. The&s;e <HI>Fondicks</HI> are every evening &s;hut up, and the Keys of them carried to the <HI>Aga</HI> of the Ca&s;tle, who takes care to &s;end them back every next morning. They are al&s;o &s;hut, and &s;o is the Water-gate, every <HI>Friday,</HI> during the Noon-Prayer, as the Ca&s;tle-gate is at <HI>Caire,</HI> and al&s;o in all places of the Turki&s;h Empire, where there are <HI>Franks,</HI> becau&s;e (they &s;ay) they have a Prophe&s;ie which threatens, that the <HI>Franks</HI> are to become Ma&s;ters of them on a <HI>Friday,</HI> during the Noon-Prayer. Hardly any thing of the ancient <HI>Alexandria</HI> remains &s;tanding, but the Walls, and &s;ome Buildings toward the <HI>Fondick</HI> of the <HI>French,</HI> which are almo&s;t ruined; for the Buildings that are now towards the &s;hore,
<PB N="122" REF="81">
are not ancient, but have been built by the Turks, as may be ea&s;ily &s;een by the Fabrick, being all low ill-contriv'd Hou&s;es. This Town hath three Ports, the fir&s;t of which, called the Old Harbour, is pretty large, but few Ve&s;&s;els put into it, becau&s;e the entry is difficult; there are two Ca&s;tles to defend it, one on each &s;ide, and both well kept. The other two Ports are higher up, and &s;eparated one from another by a little I&s;land, heretofore farther off from the main Land, than it is at pre&s;ent, and anciently called the <HI>Pharos:</HI> It is at pre|&s;ent joyned to the main Land by a Stone-bridge of &s;ome Arches, under which the water pa&s;&s;es. This I&s;le runs out a great way in <HI>Meo;</HI> in the middle of it, there is a large &s;quare Tower,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Farillon.</NOTE> where the <HI>Grand Signior</HI>'s Powder is kept. At the end of the &s;ame I&s;le, there is a good Ca&s;tle, called <HI>Farillon,</HI> that &s;tands in the &s;ame place where the heretofore &s;o renowned <HI>Pharos</HI> &s;tood, which was reckoned One of the Seven Wonders of the World; this which is now in the place of it; is neat enough, and well provided with Artillery, and a Gari&s;on of three hundred Soldiers, commanded by a <HI>Muteferaca;</HI> but it hath no other water than that of the <HI>Nile,</HI> which is brought into it from without upon Camels. The fir&s;t of the two Ports divided by the <HI>Pharos,</HI> is the Harbour of the Galleys; and the other is the Great Port, or New Harbour, the mouth whereof is on the one &s;ide defended by the <HI>Farillon;</HI> and on the other &s;ide, by another little Ca&s;tle at its entry, which is not &s;o good as the <HI>Farillon;</HI> however it is kept by &s;everal Soldiers, and the&s;e two Ca&s;tles ea&s;ily &s;uccour one another. Both the&s;e Ports are very dangerous, becau&s;e of the Stones and Rocks that are in them, and there is need of a good Pilot to bring Ve&s;&s;els in. The Great Port lyes much open to the North-ea&s;t and North winds: The Harbour of the Gal|leys, is the &s;afer of the two, but it hath no great depth of water; and indeed, (as I have already &s;aid) it &s;erves only for Galleys. The Cu&s;tome-hou&s;e of <HI>Alexandria,</HI> on which that of <HI>Ro&s;&s;etto</HI> depends, is upon the &s;ide of the Great Port:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Muhezin.</NOTE> It is let out to a Turk, who therefore is called <HI>Multezin,</HI> or Farmer, and pays the <HI>Grand Signior</HI> three hundred Pur&s;es a year, which make two hundred twenty &s;even thou&s;and two hundred three&s;core and twelve <HI>Pia&s;tres,</HI> four&s;core <HI>Maidins:</HI> Neverthele&s;s he is at no trouble about it, for he di&s;charges the office by a Jew, to whom he gives a Pur&s;e yearly, which makes five and twenty thou&s;and <HI>Maidins.</HI> The Jew who hath this employ|ment,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Maalem.</NOTE> is called <HI>Maalem,</HI> and hath other Jews under him; he is Powerful, and by his intrigues, can do &s;ervice or injury to a great many. Seing the Cu&s;tome-hou&s;e is kept by Jews, there is nothing to be done there on <HI>Saturday,</HI> becau&s;e it is their <HI>Sabbath,</HI> and yet no Ve&s;&s;el can load or unload, unle&s;s the Cu&s;tome-hou&s;e be open. There is another Cu&s;tome-hou&s;e on the right hand, as you go from the <HI>Fondick</HI> of the <HI>French</HI> towards the &s;hore, pretty near the Water-gate, and is called the Old Cu&s;tome-hou&s;e; it is now above four hundred paces from the Sea, though heretofore the water beat again&s;t the Walls of it. Some <HI>Janizaries</HI> are &s;till there at the door, and exact &s;ome|thing of all Goods that pa&s;s, that &s;o they may not lo&s;e their Rights. There are in <HI>Alexandria</HI> two little Mounts, made of Ruines heaped together, and one of them may very well be &s;een from the <HI>French Fondick;</HI> it hath a little &s;quare Tower on the top, where a Man always &s;tands Sentinel, and puts out a Flag a&s;&s;oon as he &s;ees any Sail; and every Ve&s;&s;el that comes into the Port, pays &s;omewhat for the keeping of that Guard. <HI>Alexandria</HI> depends on the <HI>Beglerbey,</HI> or <HI>Ba&s;ha</HI> of <HI>Aegypt,</HI> who has his Re&s;idence at <HI>Caire;</HI> and in <HI>Alexan|dria</HI> there is an <HI>Aga</HI> that repre&s;ents his Per&s;on, and Commands there. There is al&s;o a Great <HI>Cady</HI> or <HI>Moulla,</HI> who hath other <HI>Cadies</HI> under him. There are al&s;o two <HI>Sou&s;-Ba&s;has,</HI> one of the Town, and the other of the Sea. All the <HI>Agas</HI> of the Ca&s;tles of <HI>Alexandria,</HI> depend al&s;o on the <HI>Ba&s;ha</HI> of <HI>Aegypt,</HI> who puts in and out whom he plea&s;es.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. II.</HI> Of the Walls of <HI>Alexandria,</HI> the Pillar of <HI>Pompey,</HI> and other Antiquities.</HEAD>
<P>I Said before that <HI>Alexandria</HI> is &s;o ruined, that many Strangers ask where it is when they are in the middle of it; yet there are &s;uch fair remains to be found among the Ruines,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fine Antiqui|ties of <HI>Alex|andria.</HI></NOTE> as ea&s;ily &s;hew that this hath been a mo&s;t rich and &s;tately Town. One of the fine&s;t things that are to be &s;een there, are the Walls, which (though ruined) are &s;till &s;o magnificent, that one mu&s;t needs confe&s;s they have been matchle&s;s; nay a good part of them are &s;till entire; and they mu&s;t needs have been &s;trong Built to la&s;t &s;o long. The&s;e Walls have fal&s;e Brayes, and are flanked with great &s;quare Towers,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The walls of <HI>Alexandria.</HI></NOTE> about two hun|dred paces di&s;tant from one another; and there is a little one betwixt every two of them; they are &s;o neatly contrived, that there are &s;tately Ca&s;emates underneath, which may &s;erve for Gallery's and Walks. I had a very earne&s;t de&s;ire to go into one of the&s;e Towers,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Magnificent Towers of the walls of <HI>Alexandria.</HI></NOTE> that I might ob&s;erve all the beauty of them, but as yet I dur&s;t not for fear of an <HI>Avanie</HI> or Fine; but being one day with another French man in the old Cu&s;tome-hou&s;e, which is only an open place, without any Building, and finding a Turk there who &s;eemed to be good natured, we prayed him to lead us into the Towers of the old Walls, near to that place, which he very willingly conde&s;cended to do; we went into two of the&s;e Towers then, which are all alike; in each Tower below, there is a large &s;quare Hall, the Vault whereof is &s;upported by great Pillars of <HI>Thebaick</HI> Stone; there are a great many Chambers above, and over all a large platform above twenty Paces &s;quare; in &s;hort, all the&s;e Towers were &s;o many Palaces able to contain two hundred men a piece: The Walls are &s;everal foot thick, and every where Port-holes in them: in every one of the&s;e Towers there are &s;everal Ci&s;terns, &s;o that each of them required an Army to take them. All the ancient Town was encompa&s;&s;ed with the&s;e lovely Walls, every way fortified by &s;uch Towers; of which mo&s;t part are ruined at pre&s;ent; though tho&s;e we went into were pretty entire: there is danger in going to &s;ee them, for the Turks finding Franks there, take occa&s;ion to amerce them, &s;aying they are Spies, or &s;ome &s;uch thing, and then nothing but Money can bring them off; &s;o that they pay dear enough for their Curio&s;itie. When I went thither, there was a French man with me, who was &s;o apprehen&s;ive of being &s;urprized, that he had not the lea&s;t &s;atisfaction, though he had lived &s;e|veral years in that Country; but we had a little the more confidence that we had a Turk with us. Next to the Walls, the fine&s;t piece of antiquity that hath with&s;tood the rage of time, is the pillar of <HI>Pompey,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Pompey</HI>'s Pil|lar in <HI>Alexan|dria.</HI></NOTE> about two hundred Paces from the Town; it is upon a little height, which makes it to be &s;een a great way off, and &s;tands upon a &s;quare Pede&s;tal, above &s;even or eight foot high; and that Pede&s;tal re&s;ts upon a &s;quare ba&s;is about twenty foot broad, and about two foot high, made up of &s;everal big Stones. The body of the Pillar is of one entire piece of Garnet, &s;o high, that the world cannot match it; for it is eigh|teen canes high, and &s;o thick, that it requires &s;ix men to fathom it round, ha|ving a lovely Capital on the top. Some have thought that this Pillar con|&s;i&s;ted of three pieces, having heard <HI>Moors</HI> &s;ay &s;o, who reckon three pieces in it, to wit, the Pede&s;tal, the Body and the Capital, (as they them&s;elves have told me) but the Body is all of one piece, as may plainly be &s;een. I know not what Engins they had in tho&s;e times, wherewith they could rai&s;e &s;uch a piece; and I am very apt to believe with a great many more,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An opinion concerning the matter of the Pillar of <HI>Pompey.</HI></NOTE> that it hath been Ca&s;t or made of a certain Ciment upon the very place, though there be not a few that ab&s;olutely deny that; &s;aying that the ancient <HI>Aegyptians</HI> got the&s;e Pillars and Oblisks, that are to be &s;een in &s;o many places of <HI>Italy,</HI> at <HI>Saide,</HI> where they pretend that many have been cut out, and brought by Water
<PB N="124" REF="82">

The&s;e Stones are very lovely, for they are greyi&s;h &s;peckled with &s;everal colours, and extraordinary hard; the &s;urface of them &s;eems to be covered with little Grains. It is &s;aid that <HI>Cae&s;ar</HI> erected this Pillar in memory of the Victory which he obtained over <HI>Pompey.</HI> At fome Paces di&s;tance from thence is <HI>Cae&s;ars</HI> Palace,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Cae&s;ars</HI> Palace in <HI>Alexandria.</HI></NOTE> but all ruined, &s;ave &s;ome Pillars of <HI>Pomphyrie,</HI> that are &s;till entire and &s;tanding, and the Fronti&s;piece &s;till pretty &s;ound; which is a very lovely piece: About three or four&s;core paces wide of that Pil|lar there is a <HI>Khalis</HI> or Canal of the Nile,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Khalis.</NOTE> which was dug by the ancient <HI>Aegyptians,</HI> to bring the water of the Nile into <HI>Alexandria,</HI> having none other to drink. This Canal which is much about the breadth of that that runs through <HI>Caire,</HI> (whereof we &s;hall &s;peak hereafter) begins about &s;ix Leagues above <HI>Ro&s;&s;etto,</HI> on the &s;ide of the Nile, and from thence comes to <HI>Alexandria,</HI> and when the Nile &s;wells, they give it a Pa&s;&s;age through this <HI>Khalis,</HI> by breaking down a bank;<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Ci&s;terns of <HI>Alexandria.</HI></NOTE> as we &s;hall take notice in &s;peaking of that of <HI>Caire;</HI> this Water fills the Ci&s;terns, which are purpo&s;ely made underneath the Town, and are very magnificent and &s;pacious; for <HI>Alexandria</HI> is all hallow under, being an entire Ci&s;tern; the Vaults whereof are &s;upported by &s;everal fair Marble-Pil|lars; and over the&s;e Arches the Hou&s;es of <HI>Alexandria</HI> were built; which made men &s;ay, that in <HI>Alexandria</HI> there was a Town under Ground, as big as that above Ground;<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Subterra|nean Town in <HI>Alexandria.</HI></NOTE> and &s;ome have a&s;&s;ured me that one may &s;till walk under the whole Town of <HI>Alexandria</HI> in fair Streets, where the &s;hops are &s;till to be &s;een, but that the Turks &s;uffer no body to go down.

But in the Months of <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> and <HI>Septem|ber,</HI> which is the time when the&s;e Ci&s;terns are filled; the new Water is un|whol&s;ome, and few that drink of it e&s;cape &s;ome Sickne&s;s or other; therefore &s;everal keep of the la&s;t years water until <HI>November.</HI> Be&s;ides that inconve|nience, the Air of <HI>Alexandria</HI> is &s;o bad during the months of <HI>July, Augu&s;t, September,</HI> and <HI>October,</HI> that many who ly upon the Ground at that time, fall into quartain Agues, which &s;ometimes hold them &s;everal Years; I my &s;elf having known &s;ome who have kept them eight years. They who ly on Board of &s;hips, (though in the Port) are not annoied with that bad Air. But to return to the <HI>Khalis,</HI> it has Gardens all along the &s;ides of it, which are full of Limon and Orange-Trees, and a great many other Trees that bear a fruit like Oranges, but &s;o big, that one cannot gra&s;p them with both hands. The&s;e fruits are not good to be eaten raw, but they peal off the Rind of them, then cut them into quarters, and clearing them of the &s;ower &s;tuff, pre&s;erve them; which make a mo&s;t excellent Con&s;erve. As for the Limons, there are two &s;orts of them, &s;ome very great, which are not good to eat; and others as &s;mall as Wall-nuts,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Juice of Li|mons.</NOTE> that are the be&s;t, becau&s;e they are full of Juice, ha|ving a very thin Skin, and the juice of them they &s;queeze upon Meat for Sauce, and likewi&s;e pre&s;s it out with Pre&s;&s;es, and therewith fill &s;everal Casks; which they &s;end to Venice, and other places: And this juice &s;erves for making of Sorbet. In the&s;e Gardens there are al&s;o <HI>Ca&s;&s;ia-Trees, Carob-Trees,</HI> and the like; and the Fields about <HI>Alexandria</HI> are full of Palm-Trees, and Capers &s;hrubs. Having &s;een the&s;e things, I returned into the Town by the Gate of <HI>Ro&s;&s;etto,</HI> where are many lovely Pillars of Porphyrian Marble; and I went to &s;ee the Chrrch of St. <HI>Catherine,</HI> held by the Greeks; there you may &s;ee the Stone on which that holy Virgin had her Head cut off.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Stone on which St. <HI>Ca|therine</HI> was Beheaded.</NOTE> This Stone looks like a piece of round Pillar, is almo&s;t two foot high, and has a hole quite through it from one end to the other, big enough to receive ones Fi&s;t: the Greeks &s;ay, that ju&s;t over that hole her Head was cut off, as may be &s;een by the marks that are in the hole, which is &s;tained all round within with Blood

<P>AFter I had &s;een what I thought fit in <HI>Alexandria,</HI> I re&s;olved to go to <HI>Ro&s;&s;etto,</HI> and parted from <HI>Alexandria</HI> on <HI>Saturday</HI> Morning the &s;ixth of <HI>January,</HI> with a <HI>Janizary</HI> whom the French Vice-Con&s;ul had given me to accompany me thither:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Bouquier.</NOTE> we pa&s;&s;ed by <HI>Bouquier,</HI> twenty &s;hort miles from <HI>Al|exandria;</HI> which is a Ca&s;tle that defends a Road that is near to it, and lodged that night at the <HI>Maadie</HI> of <HI>Alexandria.</HI> Till you come to the <HI>Maadie</HI> there is no place to re&s;t in, being all a De&s;art of Sand. This place is called <HI>Maadie,</HI> that is to &s;ay, Pa&s;&s;age; becau&s;e there is a Lake there to be cro&s;&s;ed over in a Ferry-Boat, with a Rope fa&s;tened to both &s;ides of the Water. The <HI>Maadie</HI> is thirty long miles from <HI>Alexandria.</HI> This water is very full of Fi&s;h, which renders a great Revenue to the <HI>Grand Signior.</HI> There is a little <HI>Kervan&s;erai</HI> on the other &s;ide of this Water, where Travellers have a Hou&s;e over head for nothing, and may eat and drink, (if they have brought Provi|&s;ions along with them:) There we ate and drank, and lay upon the Field-beds that we carried with us.</P>
<P>Next day being <HI>Sunday,</HI> we &s;et out in the Morning, and about noon came to <HI>Ro&s;&s;etto,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ro&s;&s;etto.</NOTE> three&s;core miles from <HI>Alexandria,</HI> but the miles indeed are &s;hort and all along the Sea-&s;ide. On our way we &s;aw the place where the River of <HI>Nile</HI> di&s;charges it &s;elf into the Sea, which is a very dangerous pa&s;&s;age for Barks and Saiques;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tht mouth of the Nile at <HI>Ro&s;&s;etto.</HI></NOTE> and clo&s;e by &s;hoar we &s;aw the wrack of that Saique, which &s;tranded the &s;ame day that the great Gallion was ca&s;t away in the Port of <HI>Alexandria,</HI> as I hinted at before. The danger is when the Sea is rough, for then it occa&s;ions an Eddy with the waters of the River, that turns the Ve&s;&s;el round and ca&s;ts it on &s;hoar, where it is &s;ure to be &s;plit; and none can &s;ave them&s;elves by Swimming, becau&s;e of the force of the Waves, but the wi&s;e make the be&s;t &s;hift they can in their Caiques.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ro&s;&s;etto.</NOTE><HI>Ro&s;&s;etto,</HI> anciently called <HI>Canopus,</HI> lyes upon a branch of the <HI>Nile,</HI> which falls into the Sea five miles below the Town, next to <HI>Caire;</HI> it is reckoned the neate&s;t Town of <HI>Aegypt;</HI> not only becau&s;e of the lovely Piazza's but al&s;o the many fair Hans it contains, and yet they daily build new ones there; for indeed it is a Town of great Trafick, and very plea&s;ant, as be|ing all encompa&s;&s;ed with lovely Gardens. The Hou&s;es of <HI>Ro&s;&s;etto</HI> are all high and well Built; it is good living there, as in all other places of <HI>Aegypt,</HI> where Victuals are very cheap, and wild-fowl e&s;pecially, Water-fowl very plentiful, which they catch &s;everal ways; but the Town hath this Inconve|nience, that in the Months of <HI>July</HI> and <HI>Augu&s;t.</HI> they drink no other water, but what they have gathered before into fair Ci&s;terns, Leaded and made for that purpo&s;e; becau&s;e (during that time) the Sea flows &s;o high, that it mingles with the water of the <HI>Nile,</HI> and renders it Bracki&s;h. The branch of the <HI>Nile</HI> that runs by this Town makes a Port for Saiques, but great Ships cannot come up to it: this port is always full of Saiques, which come from the <HI>Archipelago</HI> to Trade in <HI>Aegypt.</HI> The Town is very carefully kept by the Sous-Ba&s;ha, from all Di&s;orders that might happen; but be&s;ides that Guard, there are three&s;core Men that in the Night-time march up and down to catch Robbers,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The cun|ning of the <HI>Arabs</HI> who rob in <HI>Ro&s;&s;etto.</HI></NOTE> who are <HI>Arabs</HI> of the De&s;arts: The&s;e Villains &s;trip them|&s;elves &s;tark-naked, then rub their Bodies over with Oyle, that one may not take fa&s;t hold of them, and in that manner come to the Town, where they Steal what they can find, and when they are pur&s;ued; ca&s;t them&s;elves into the River, and &s;wim over to the other &s;ide. I made no long &s;tay at <HI>Ro&s;&s;etto;</HI> but knowing that every <HI>Tue&s;day</HI> and <HI>Friday</HI> Barks go off from <HI>Ro&s;&s;etto</HI> to <HI>Caire,</HI> I waited for the fir&s;t opportunity, that I might go in company with &s;everal Barks, which is the way to be &s;afe from the Pirates of the <HI>Nile,</HI> and having

hired a little Boat only for my&s;elf and my Servant, that I might be at more ea&s;e. I parted from <HI>Ro&s;&s;etto Friday</HI> the nineteenth of <HI>January,</HI> about Noon. The&s;e Barks are Caiques, or ordinary Boats, and I had a Tilt or Covering made of Matts in the Stern, to keep me from the Sun and the Dew, which on the <HI>Nile</HI> is very cold and piercing: It was very bad weather that day, how|ever we went on, and <HI>Wedne&s;day</HI> the twenty fourth of <HI>January,</HI> pa&s;&s;ed the place where the Chanel divides it &s;elf into two Branches, of which one goes to <HI>Ro&s;&s;etto,</HI> and the other to <HI>Damiette.</HI> The &s;ame day in the Evening we came to <HI>Boulac,</HI> which is the Port of <HI>Caire,</HI> though it be half a League from it.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Boulac.</NOTE> <HI>Boulac</HI> is a pretty big long and narrow Town, built upon the &s;ide of the <HI>Nile,</HI> and has many Gardens and country Hou&s;es about it. At <HI>Boulac</HI> we paid a <HI>Pia&s;tre</HI> a piece to &s;ome <HI>Jews;</HI> it being the cu&s;tome that every Frank the fir&s;t time he comes to <HI>Caire,</HI> pays a <HI>Pia&s;tre</HI> at <HI>Boulac.</HI> In my Voyage from <HI>Ro&s;&s;etto</HI> to <HI>Caire,</HI> I ob&s;erved that all the land upon the Nile &s;ides is excellently good; and really, <HI>Aegypt</HI> may be &s;aid to be an Earthly Paradi&s;e, but Inhabited by Devils; not only becau&s;e the Inhabitants are Tawny, but al&s;o very Vicious, great Robbers e&s;pecially, and &s;uch as will kill a Man for a penny; and indeed, they are very Poor; therefore when one goes by Water upon the Nile, he had need keep a good Guard again&s;t the Cor&s;airs. During our Voyage in the night-time we lighted &s;everal Matches which we fa&s;tened round about our Bark on the out-&s;ide; and the <HI>Arabs</HI> &s;eeing the&s;e Matches. ea&s;ily take them for &s;o many Mu&s;quets, which they are deadly afraid of, as not know|ing the u&s;e of them; be&s;ides that, we had Fire-Arms, which we now and then Di&s;charged, as well by night, as by day, that they might hear them: but notwith&s;tanding all that, a Bark of Robbers came one night up with our Caiques, which one having di&s;covered, he allarmed the re&s;t, then all cried to them to keep off; thereupon they made an&s;wer in Turki&s;h that we need not be afraid, for they were Friends, and would go in company with us; but when we called to them again, that if they did not &s;tand off, we would Fire at them, they went their way. At <HI>Boulac</HI> we took A&s;&s;es to carry us to <HI>Caire,</HI> half a League di&s;tant from thence; My Lord <HI>Honorie de Bermond,</HI> the French Con&s;ul, did me the favour to lodge me at his Hou&s;e.

<P><HI>Caire,</HI> the Capital and Metropolitan City of <HI>Aegypt,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Caire.</NOTE> before it fell under the Turki&s;h Dominion, was in the later times Governed by <HI>Sultans,</HI> or Kings, who were taken from among the <HI>Mamalukes.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Mamalukes.</NOTE> The&s;e <HI>Mamalukes</HI> were all <HI>Circa&s;&s;ian</HI> Slaves, bought of Merchants, who came and &s;old them to the <HI>Sultan</HI> of <HI>Aegypt,</HI> who pre&s;ently made them renounce the Chri&s;tian Religion; then committed them to the care of Ma&s;ters of Exerci&s;e, by whom they were taught to bend the Bow, &s;hoot exact, give a true thru&s;t with a Launce, make u&s;e of Sword and Buckler, &s;it a Hor&s;e well, (for they were all Hor&s;e-men) and skilfully manage him.

They would be&s;ides have the advantage of the Wind, which blows on all hands along the River, &s;o that the heat would not be &s;o prejudicial; nay more, it would be a great help to Trade, in that it would ea&s;e them of the labour and charges of loading their Goods on Camels, to carry them from the City to the Port, or from the Port to the City: And indeed,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Memphis.</NOTE> the Antients cho&s;e a very good Situation for <HI>Memphis,</HI> on the other &s;ide of the River; and Old <HI>Caire</HI> hath &s;ince been built oppo&s;ite to <HI>Memphis</HI> al&s;o, upon the River: But the Later, who ought to correct the faults of the more Ancient, (if they were guilty of any) have committed the greate&s;t errours; for I can &s;ee no rea&s;on why they have pitched upon that incommodious Situa|tion, unle&s;s it was (perhaps) to joyn the City to the Ca&s;tle, that &s;o it might be under the protection thereof.</P>

I walked once on foot al&s;o the whole length of the <HI>Khalis,</HI> from end to end, which is exactly the length of the City of <HI>Caire,</HI> for it is a Street that goes through the middle of it, from one end to another. I &s;et out early in the morning with a <HI>Janizary,</HI> that I might not be by any hindred in my de&s;ign, or abu&s;ed; and being come to the end, about St. <HI>Michael</HI>'s, I alighted, and having &s;et two Watches which I had in my pocket at the &s;ame hour, I began to walk pretty fa&s;t: when I came to the other end of <HI>Khalis,</HI> I found that we had been almo&s;t three quarters of an hour in going the length of it; and I could un|dertake to perform it very well in half an hour, if I had not on Turki&s;h Shoes, as I had at that time, which was a great hindrance to me, for at every turn my Paboutches &s;lipt off my feet; and be&s;ides I was in my Ve&s;t, that likewi&s;e retarded my going. I reckoned al&s;o all the &s;teps I made, putting at each hundred paces, a bean in my pocket, and at the end I found one and fifty beans in my pocket, which are five thou&s;and one hundred of my paces, about two foot and a half each pace. It is to be minded al&s;o, that within the Precincts of it, there are &s;everal places not inhabited, as &s;everal <HI>Birques,</HI> about which there are goodly Hou&s;es; but to &s;ay the truth likewi&s;e, the places that are inhabited, are very full. Tho&s;e who would have <HI>Caire</HI> to be bigger than <HI>Paris,</HI> when they &s;peak of <HI>Caire,</HI> comprehend therein Old <HI>Caire,</HI> and <HI>Boulac;</HI> but that cannot rationally be done, el&s;e I may comprehend within <HI>Paris,</HI> all the Villages that are about it; for Old <HI>Caire</HI> is &s;eparated from the New, by Fields; and <HI>Boulac</HI> is another Town, divided from <HI>Caire</HI> by &s;everal ploughed Grounds: There is al&s;o near
<PB N="129" REF="84">
<HI>Caire,</HI> on the way to <HI>Boulac,</HI> a very large place, called <HI>Lesbike,</HI> which contains many Acres of <HI>Land.</HI> When the <HI>Khalis</HI> runs, this place is under water, and continues &s;o four or five months, after which they fow &s;everal things there, that grow a pace, the ground being very fat. This &s;pacicus place is &s;urrounded with many very lovely Palaces of <HI>Beys,</HI> and other Great Men of the Countrey, who go thither now and then to divert them&s;elves for &s;ome days. But to my pur|po&s;e again, I think I may confidently &s;ay, that <HI>Caire</HI> is not &s;o big as <HI>Paris;</HI> but I believe it is more populous, for there are in it ugly Sties or Holes, rather than Hou&s;es, full of Women and Children, who never &s;tir out of doors, becau&s;e in the Turki&s;h Empire, the Women go neither to Market, nor any other place out of doors, but only to the Bath, and yet the &s;treets are always full of people, and when a Plague &s;weeps away two hundred thou&s;and Souls in <HI>Caire,</HI> it is not perceived. Several have written that <HI>Caire</HI> has no Walls, and that, perhaps, has made them confound <HI>Caire</HI> with <HI>Boulac</HI> and Old <HI>Caire,</HI> but they have not look'd well about them, for <HI>Caire</HI> is encompa&s;&s;ed round with very fair and thick Walls; they are built of good Stone, which is &s;till &s;o white, that one would &s;ay they were newly built, if it were not to be known by the great cracks which are in many places, that they are very ancient. The&s;e Walls have very hand&s;ome Battlements, and at le&s;s than an hundred paces interval, lovely Towers, able to contain many People; they have been built very high, but are at pre&s;ent all covered with Ruines, which are &s;o high, that I have pa&s;s'd over &s;ome places where they wholly hide the Walls, and are much above them; and in tho&s;e places one would think there were no Wall, if (where the Ruines are lower) it were not to be &s;een carried on as the re&s;t is: And though it would be very ea&s;ie to clear the Rubbi&s;h, and by repairing what is wanting, make the Walls appear beautiful and high, yet the Turks make no Reparations, but &s;uffer all to run to decay. And &s;o have they &s;uffered a large and the lovelie&s;t part of the Ca&s;tle to fall to ruine, through their neglect in repairing it near to the &s;aid Walls. In many places there are great Church-yards, full of Sepulchres, ador|ned with fair Stones, that yield a plea&s;ant Pro&s;pect, and would &s;uffice for building of a Town.

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. V.</HI> Of the Pyramides.</HEAD>
<P>HEretofore there have been &s;uch powerful Kings in <HI>Aegypt,</HI> who have un|dertaken &s;o great Works, that it is not to be thought &s;trange, if in &s;pight of Time it &s;elf (which devours all things) &s;ome pieces of them have re|mained till our days; or rather it is to be wondred that &s;o little remains of &s;o many Magnificences, which heretofore made <HI>Aegypt</HI> &s;o Renowned all over the World;<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Pyra|mides of <HI>Aegypt.</HI></NOTE> but nothing has braved Time &s;o much, as the Pyramides that are to be &s;een near to <HI>Caire,</HI> doubtle&s;s they de&s;erve very well to be &s;een, &s;ince they have merited a place among the Wonders of the World. But there are &s;ome things to be taken notice of, in this little Progre&s;s from <HI>Caire</HI> to the Pyramides, and (if I mi&s;take not) I have ob&s;erved them here exactly enough. Having de&s;igned to go &s;ee the Pyramides, the Evening before, I hired A&s;&s;es and <HI>Moors,</HI> that I might &s;et out next Morning be-times; the&s;e Bea&s;ts are much u&s;ed in <HI>Aegypt,</HI> and carry one conveniently enough at an ea&s;ie Trot, and &s;ometimes a good Gallop too. There are of them to be hired in the Corners of mo&s;t of the Quarters of <HI>Caire,</HI> and are ready Sadled, &s;o that there needs no more but to get up. The <HI>Franks</HI> put little Carpets over the Sadles, made for the pur|po&s;e, and Stirrups for greater Convenience: If you will, the <HI>Moor</HI> that letts the A&s;s will follow, to drive him on, and be careful to cry <HI>(Take heed.)</HI> And I found it nece&s;&s;ary for a <HI>Frank,</HI> to take one with him, paying as much for the <HI>Moor</HI> as for the A&s;s; however no Body is obliged to take a <HI>Moor</HI> unle&s;s they plea&s;e, yet in this Progre&s;s they are ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, for clearing the Entry of the Pyramides, as I &s;hall &s;ay hereafter. I hired <HI>Moors</HI> and A&s;&s;es, not only to Ride on, but al&s;o to carry our Provi&s;ions, for one mu&s;t Dine there. And &s;eeing I had a de&s;ign to go from thence to &s;ee the <HI>Mummies,</HI> I provided for two or three days; there is nothing to be found in tho&s;e parts, but what Men carry along with them, and I acquainted a <HI>Janizary</HI> of the Con&s;uls, to be ready with his Mu&s;quet to go along with me. Next day taking our Fowling-Pieces with us, both to &s;hoot by the Way, and to defend us again&s;t the <HI>Arabs.</HI> We &s;et out by break of Day with our <HI>Janizary,</HI> armed with Sword and Mu&s;quet, and took our way by old <HI>Caire,</HI> about half a French League from <HI>Caire,</HI> where being come, we cro&s;&s;ed the Water over again&s;t the Pyramides. On the other &s;ide of the Water there is a Village, and &s;ome more beyond it towards the Pyramides,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The di|&s;tance of the Pyramides from <HI>Caire.</HI></NOTE> with &s;everal <HI>Birques</HI> al&s;o, where there is always Game; at length we came to the Pyramides, which are three Leagues from <HI>Caire.</HI> The Pyra|mides which the Turks call <HI>Pharaon Daglary,</HI> and the Arabs <HI>Dgebel Pharaon,</HI> that is to &s;ay, <HI>Pharaoh</HI>'s Hills, are cheifly three, which are &s;een from <HI>Caire,</HI> and a great way beyond it.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The number of the Pyra|mides.</NOTE> There are others, as that of the <HI>Mummies,</HI> and and many more that are not con&s;iderable. One of the&s;e three Pyramides is little in re&s;pect of the other two, and is &s;hut up; the other two are great, and many (not without rea&s;on) doubt which of the two is the bigger, how|ever, the bigger is certainly that which is open, which Men mount and enter into. The other is &s;hut, and by con&s;equence, one can neither enter nor go up it. They &s;ay, that heretofore at the entry of that which is open, there was a great Stone cut purpo&s;ely to &s;top the Mouth of it, when the Body that was to lie there was put in, which &s;topt it &s;o exactly, that neither the place that was &s;topt, nor the Stone which &s;topt it, could be known or di&s;tingui&s;hed; but that a <HI>Ba&s;ha</HI> cau&s;ed that va&s;t Stone to be removed, that there might be no way afterward for &s;hutting up the Pyramide.<NOTE PLACE="marg">A very exact mea&s;ure of the Pyra|mides by Fa|ther <HI>Elzear,</HI> a Capucin.</NOTE> I took the Dimen&s;ions of this Pyramide, and having compared them with the Mea&s;ures of the Reverend Father <HI>Elzear</HI> the <HI>Capucin,</HI> I found him to have bene as exact as one po&s;&s;ibly could be, there not being the third part of a Barley-corn difference betwixt him and me; and therefore I &s;hall not at all &s;cruple to u&s;e his own Terms in

&s;ome places. When you come to that Pyramide, you mu&s;t lay a&s;ide what heavy things you have about you, and prepare to mount up to the top, whil&s;t your <HI>Moors</HI> are clearing the pa&s;&s;age to go in; for the Wind drives always a great deal of Sand into it, which &s;tops the pa&s;&s;age to the bottom, and the <HI>Moors</HI> ca&s;t out that Sand. Be&s;ides, if one &s;hould go in before he went up to the top, he would be &s;o weary when he came out, that he would never re&s;olve to go up; and then, it is be&s;t going up before the Sun be high. It is fit you &s;hould have a Guide to go before you when you a&s;cend, I mean, &s;ome <HI>Frank,</HI> who hath been already there; for if you do not take the right Way, you'll &s;oon come to &s;uch places, where you can neither go up nor down, without danger of tumbling headlong. The ea&s;ie&s;t place to go up at,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The &s;ide by which one &s;hould go up the Pyramide</NOTE> is the Angle that looks betwixt Ea&s;t and North. This Pyramide has Two hundred and eight great Stone-&s;teps, the thickne&s;s of a Stone making a &s;tep of about Two Foot and a half high one with another, for &s;ome of them are thicker, and above Three Foot high, as I mea&s;ured them; this number of &s;teps has been ob&s;erved by &s;everal, though &s;ome reckon fewer, and others more. Nay, a Man coming again a &s;econd time, &s;hall not find the &s;ame number that he had at fir&s;t, if he begin not to a&s;cend at the &s;ame place; becau&s;e betwixt the Corners towards the middle of the Front, there is a little Hill of Sand driven there by the Wind, that covers &s;everal &s;teps, which they that go up at that place reckon not: Be&s;ides, that the trouble in going up, makes one often mi&s;count; for you mu&s;t &s;et your Knees upon &s;everal &s;teps becau&s;e of their heighth, and then &s;ome reckon half &s;teps for whole ones. Many think that the&s;e &s;teps have only been made by the Weather, but in all appearance, that could not have worn them out &s;o regularly, though without doubt, it eats out a great deal, as may be &s;een by the pieces that lie all round below.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The heighth of the Pyra|mide.</NOTE> This Pyramide is Five hundred and twenty Foot high, upon a Ba&s;e of Six hundred and eighty two Foot &s;quare; about half way up, in one of the Angles of the Pyramide, that looks betwixt Ea&s;t and North, which is the place by which I &s;hould advi&s;e one to go up; there is a little &s;quare Room, but nothing to be &s;een therein,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Room.</NOTE> only if you be Weary you may re&s;t in it: And I am not again&s;t what &s;everal do, who bring with them a little Bottle, or Gourd, full of Wine, to refre&s;h them|&s;elves when they are got there, or up to the top, for it makes one very faint. When you are come up to the top, you find a fair Platform,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Platform upon the Py|ramide.</NOTE> from whence you have a plea&s;ant Pro&s;pect. This Platform which from below appears to you like a Point, is made of twelve lovely large Stones, being &s;ixteen Foot and two thirds &s;quare; there are &s;ome Stones wanting, and it is to be believed, that they have been pu&s;hed down by Men, for the Weather could not do it. A Man,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Stone thrown from the top of the Pyra|mide falls not beyond the &s;teps.</NOTE> unle&s;s he be extraordinary &s;trong, cannot indeed, throw a Stone from the top, and make it fall beyond the &s;teps of the Pyramide. For I got a pretty &s;trong Man to throw one, and all he could do, was to make it fall upon the twelfth &s;tep, or a little lower. But I look upon it as a Fable, that one cannot &s;hoot an Arrow beyond the foundation of the Pyramide; for it is certain, that an Arrow drawn by a good Arm, will ea&s;ily flie Three hundred and one and forty Foot, which is one half of the breadth of the Pyramide.</P>
<P>Having con&s;idered the&s;e things,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Door of the Pyra|mide.</NOTE> we came down the &s;ame way that we went up, and having taken a little re&s;t, came to the Door of the Pyramide, which is at the &s;ixteenth &s;tep as you go up, looking towards the North; it is not exactly in the middle, there being Three hundred and ten Foot of the &s;ide be|low to the Ea&s;t of it, which being &s;ub&s;tracted from Six hundred eighty two, there remain Three hundred &s;eventy two Foot to the We&s;t &s;ide; &s;o that this &s;ide &s;urpa&s;&s;es the other by Sixty two Foot. <HI>Caire</HI> lies Northward from it. Now to come to this Door, you mu&s;t go up a little Hill,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A little Hill joyned to the Pyramide.</NOTE> joyned to the Pyra|mide on that &s;ide, which (as I &s;aid before) hath in my opinion, been made by the Sand which the Wind hath brought there, and &s;o ri&s;en up to a heap,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A very great Stone over the Door of the Pyra|mide.</NOTE> becau&s;e it could go no further, by rea&s;on of the Pyramide. The Lintel over this Door is very con&s;iderable, being one Stone eleven Foot long, and eight Foot thick: Before any go in, they make the <HI>Janizary</HI> fire two or three Mu&s;quet-&s;hot into it, to frighten away (as they &s;ay) the Serpents that are there; but I never heard of any that had been found in it. The entry is &s;quare, and all along of a like Dimen&s;ion, being three Foot &s;ix Inches High, and three
<PB N="122" REF="86">
Foot three Inches Wide: This pa&s;&s;age, or rather &s;ink-hole, as being very &s;teep and &s;helving, continuing in the &s;ame heighth and breadth, goes &s;loaping down Seventy &s;ix Foot, five Inches and two Barley Corns in length: At the bottom of that De&s;cent, you find an A&s;cent of the &s;ame widene&s;s, and &s;helving in the &s;ame manner as the former, by which one goes up &s;ome three Foot; and the greate&s;t difficulty of the Pyramide, is at this place. For fancy to your &s;elf, that this De&s;cent butting in the A&s;cent, makes with it a &s;harp Ridg, over which there is a great Stone, which is the lowermo&s;t Stone of the Roof of the De&s;cent, and is perpendicular to it, betwixt which and the Sand, there is not above a good Foots-&s;pace to pa&s;s through; &s;o that one mu&s;t &s;lide upon his Belly clo&s;e upon the Ground, and for all that, you rub and grate your Back again&s;t the afore&s;aid Stone, unle&s;s you be a very &s;lender Man; and be&s;ides, you mu&s;t advance with your feet up in the De&s;cent, your Belly low betwixt the De&s;cent and next A&s;cent, and your Head ri&s;ing up in the beginning of the &s;ame A&s;cent. In &s;hort, in this narrow pa&s;s, one mu&s;t crawl like a Serpent, and therefore it is very painful, &s;o that a thick Man would be &s;tiffled in the Sand, unle&s;s he were &s;peedily pulled out by the Feet; for the Head mu&s;t go fir&s;t, it being utterly impo&s;&s;ible that the Feet &s;hould. This pa&s;&s;age however, might be made ea&s;ie and pa&s;&s;able enough, if the <HI>Moors</HI> would take the pains to clear the Hole well, I mean, take out the Sand: For I went thither another time, when we were told, &s;ome of the <HI>Ba&s;ha</HI>'s Servants had been there three days before, being curious to &s;ee what it was that obliged the <HI>Franks</HI> to go into it, becau&s;e none but <HI>Franks</HI> go there; and we fonnd the pa&s;&s;age &s;o clean and ea&s;ie, that we pa&s;&s;ed it without putting either Belly or Knee to the Ground. And I make no doubt, but it is as high there, as at the entry into the Pyramide, but the Wind driving in much Sand, it heaps up in this place; and the <HI>Moors,</HI> who are naturally Lazie, after they have removed two or three Load, carry out no more, unle&s;s they be very well pay'd, and threatned with a good Cudgel be&s;ides; which Chri&s;tians dare not do, nor yet de&s;ire that their <HI>Jani|zary</HI> &s;hould, for fear of an <HI>Avanie.</HI> Having pa&s;t this &s;treight, every one takes a lighted Candle (and for that end, you mu&s;t not forget to bring &s;eve|ral with you) and a Steel and Tinder-box al&s;o, becau&s;e of a great many Bats that are there, which &s;ometimes put out your Candles, which may go out al&s;o by many other accidents. There you find a &s;ultry &s;tiffling Air, which neverthele&s;s, you'll be &s;oon accu&s;tomed to, before you go up the in|ner A&s;cent. You'll find an ugly Hole on your Right hand, which reaches a pretty way, it hath not (in all probability) been purpo&s;ely made, but only by the decayings of Time; and is as narrow at the end, as at the mouth. Having then gone about an Hundred and eleven Foot in the afore&s;aid A&s;cent, you find as it were two Pa&s;&s;ages or Galleries,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Two other pa&s;&s;ages in the Pyra|mide.</NOTE> one low and parallel to the Ho|rizon, and the other high &s;loaping upwards like the former. There is a Well or pit at the entry of the fir&s;t pa&s;&s;age; of which I &s;hall &s;peak hereafter. This low pa&s;&s;age is three Foot and three Inches &s;quare, and leads to a Room not far di&s;tant, with a &s;harp-ridged Seeling or Roof; and near to this, or at lea&s;t pretty high,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Window which many alledg.</NOTE> &s;everal affirm that there is a Window, which gives a pa&s;&s;age into other places, but that one mu&s;t have a Ladder to get up to it. For my part, I maintain that there is no &s;uch Window, with re&s;pect &s;till to tho&s;e who &s;ay there is, and they mu&s;t have taken a kind of dampne&s;s which is in that place for a Window; for three times I a&s;&s;ayed to find it out, and every time carried a Rope-Ladder, which I had made with Hooks to get up with; but having carefully &s;earched about with &s;everal Torches, neither I, nor any that were with me could find it. From the fir&s;t pa&s;&s;age you go up to the other, &s;even or eight Foot high, putting youc Feet in holes that are made in the Wall. This other pa&s;&s;age that mounts upwards, is &s;ix Foot four Inches wide, and reaches in that manner an Hundred three&s;core and two Foot, having on each &s;ide (as it were) two little Benches, two Foot and a half high, to lean upon, and Holes in the Ground at every &s;tep, to re&s;t ones Feet in. At the end of this pa&s;&s;age is the Hall,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Hall in the Pyramide.</NOTE> being thirty two Foot in length, nineteen in heighth, and &s;ixteen in breadth; the Roof of it is flat, con&s;i&s;ting of Nine Stones, the &s;even in the middle being &s;ixteen Foot long, and four Foot broad a piece, the other two at each end, appear not to be above two Foot broad a
<PB N="133" REF="86">
piece, but the rea&s;on is becau&s;e the other half of them is built into the Wall; they are of the &s;ame length as the other &s;even, all &s;even reaching a cro&s;s the breadth of the Hall, with their ends re&s;ting upon the walls on each &s;ide. At the end of that Hall there is an empty Tomb all of one &s;tone, that &s;ounds like a great Bell; it is three foot and an Inch wide, three foot and four Inches high, and &s;even foot two inches long: this &s;tone is very hard, looks like a kind of Porphyrie, and is very neat when poli&s;hed, which makes many break off pieces of it to make Seals of; but it requires a &s;trong Arm and good Ham|mer to knock off a bit.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Beauty of the walls of the hall of the Pyramid.</NOTE> The Walls of the Hall are faced with &s;tones of the &s;ame &s;ort, though to &s;ome they &s;eem not &s;o fine; but they are the very &s;ame.</P>
<P>It is the common opinion of all, that this Tomb was made for the &s;ame <HI>Pharao,</HI> who by the permi&s;&s;ion of God, was Drowned in the <HI>Red-Sea,</HI> he and his whole Army, who were in pur&s;uit of the <HI>Jews,</HI> at that time the cho&s;en People of God. As to the doubt that many people make, whether this Tomb was placed there before the Pyramide was Built; I think it is not at all to be doubted, but that it was &s;et there before the Pyramide was fini&s;hed; for though the entry be wide enough for the Tomb, yet the a&s;cent that immediately &s;ucceeds to the de&s;cent, mu&s;t have hindred the conveyance of it.</P>
<P>As to the Pit which I mentioned before, into which no man ever de&s;cended for ought we knew, before the Month of <HI>September,</HI> 1652. That the Reverend father <HI>Elzear,</HI> a Capuchin, with &s;ome others went down: finding what dan|ger there was in de&s;cending, I would not attempt it, though I had brought Ropes purpo&s;ely with me; e&s;pecially &s;ince I knew from the relation of Father <HI>Elzear</HI> that there was nothing Curious therein; but a Scoti&s;h Gentleman with whom I was, fa&s;tened him&s;elf to Ropes, and having taken in his hand a little Wax-candle lighted, our <HI>Moors</HI> let him down; and that was the &s;econd time that any had de&s;cended into it. This Gentleman being come up again, gave me a relation wholly conform to that of Father <HI>Elzear;</HI> and &s;ince that, I have got others to go down, who told me the &s;ame things. As you go then from the fir&s;t pa&s;&s;age or Gallery we mentioned before on the right hand that is like a Door, you find this Well, which goes down in a perpendicular line, that neverthele&s;s crooks a little, and makes in a manner the figure of a Spit, or of a Hebrew Lamed; &s;o that &s;ixty &s;even foot down from the top, there is a &s;quare Window, that enters into a little Cave hallowed in the Hill, which in that place is not a Rock, but like Gravel, or well compacted peble-&s;tones, and this Grott or Cave reaches Ea&s;t and We&s;t fifteen foot from thence,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A hole in the pit of the Pyramide.</NOTE> and eighty two in all, from the top or mouth thither; there is a very &s;teep &s;hel|ving and almo&s;t perpendicular hole or de&s;cent cut in the Rock, about two foot and a third part of a foot wide, and two foot and a half high, reaching downwards an hundred twenty three foot, and then it is full of Sand, and the dung of Batts, which &s;o &s;warm there, that the Scot told me he was afraid he &s;hould have been ate up by them, and that he was forced to guard his Candle with both hands, le&s;t they &s;hould have put it out; there are &s;ome &s;tones in it al&s;o, which have been thrown down from the top, or have fal|len of them&s;elves, as it happened while my Scot was below; for &s;etting a foot again&s;t the Rock on each &s;ide, as he was comeing up again, a Stone fell which had brained him, if it had fallen upon his Head, but it fell upon the Candle, put it out, and beat it down to the bottom.</P>
<P>In all probability this Pit hath only been made to let down the Bodies which were laid in the Caves that are under the Pyramide. When the Scoti&s;h Gentleman was come up, I made a man hold a Candle at the top of the &s;econd pa&s;&s;age, and going down to the bottom near the &s;treight turning, I looked up to the Candle, which was a pretty plea&s;ant Object, appearing then no big|ger than a little Star. At length when we were got out of this Pyramide, we were made &s;en&s;ible of an errour we had committed, for our <HI>Janizary</HI> that had never been within before, entred with us, and by good luck going out again a little after with &s;ome of our company,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Arabs</HI> rob tho&s;e that go to &s;ee the Pyramids.</NOTE> they e&s;pied &s;ix <HI>Arabs</HI> on Hor&s;e-back, making up to the Pyramide, but he having pre&s;ented his Mu&s;quet and our Men their Fowling-pieces at them, they went back as they came: if they had come a moment &s;ooner, they had taken all our Provi&s;ions,
<PB N="134" REF="87">
and &s;tripped us &s;tark naked as fa&s;t as we came out. To prevent &s;uch a danger, the be&s;t way is to leave the <HI>Janizary</HI> and &s;ome of the company without to keep guard.</P>
<P>Having reflected a little on the danger which we had e&s;caped, we viewed the &s;econd Pyramide,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Second Pyra|mide.</NOTE> that is &s;hut, and nothing of it to be &s;een but the out-&s;ide, which is &s;ix hundred thirty one foot &s;quare.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Third Pyra|mide.</NOTE>The third is but little, and not very con&s;iderable.

<P>Really the&s;e Pyramides are Wonders worthy of the ancient Kings of <HI>Aegypt,</HI> who for magnificence in Buildings, exceeded all others of their time; and I believe (without di&s;paragement to any) that no Prince in the World is able to rai&s;e &s;uch Works, a&s;wel for the difficulty of piling up &s;o many huge Stones one over another, as for the tediou&s;ne&s;s of the labour. Many think it very &s;trange whence they could have &s;uch large Stones, and in &s;o great a quantity, &s;eeing the Countrey all about is nothing but Sand; but they have not minded, that under that Sand there are Rocks, out of which they had the Stones; be&s;ides &s;everal neighbouring Mountains that abound in Stone; though (&s;ome &s;ay) that they were brought from <HI>Saide</HI> upon the <HI>Nile.</HI></P>
<P>It is the Opinion of many, that the&s;e Pyramides were heretofore higher above ground, than they are at pre&s;ent, but that the Sand hath covered a good part of their Ba&s;es; and it is not unlikely, &s;eeing the North-&s;ide is covered up &s;o to the very door, and the three other &s;ides are not, which makes men think, that it blowing more violently from the North, than from any other corner; the wind hath driven more Sand on that &s;ide, than other Winds hath on the other &s;ides.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The marks of Buildings near the Py|ramides.</NOTE> Before each of the three Pyramides, the marks of certain &s;quare Buildings are &s;till to be &s;een, which &s;eem to have been &s;o many Temples; and there is a hole at the end of the pretended Temple of the &s;econd Pyramide, by which (&s;ome think) there was a way down within the Temple to go to the Idol, which is a few &s;teps di&s;tant from that hole. The <HI>Arabs</HI> call this Idol <HI>Abou el haoun,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Abou el haoun. Sphynx. <HI>King</HI> Ama&s;is.</NOTE> that is to &s;ay, Father of the Pillar, which <HI>Pliny</HI> calls <HI>Sphynx,</HI> &s;aying, that the People of the Countrey believe King <HI>Ama&s;is</HI> was buried in it: I am &s;ure they believe no &s;uch thing at pre&s;ent, nor &s;o much as know the Name of <HI>Ama&s;is;</HI> and indeed, it is an erroneous belief. Others &s;ay, that a King of <HI>Aegypt</HI> cau&s;ed this Figure to be made in memory of a certain <HI>Rhodope,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Rhodope.</NOTE> a <HI>Corinthian</HI> Woman, with whom he was much in love. It is &s;aid, that this <HI>Sphynx,</HI> &s;o &s;oon as the Sun was up, gave re&s;pon&s;es to any thing it was con&s;ulted about; and hence it is that all who go into the Pyramides, fail not to &s;ay, that a Prie&s;t conveyed him&s;elf into that Idol, by the Pit or Well in the Pyramide which we ju&s;t now de&s;cribed. But to &s;hew how groundle&s;s an Opinion that is, we mu&s;t know how the Idol is made: It is the Bu&s;t of a Body, at &s;ome &s;teps di&s;tance from the open Pyramide, cut out of the natural Rock, from which it hath never been &s;eparated, though it &s;eem to be of five Stones pieced together one upon another; but having very attentively con&s;idered it, we ob&s;erved, that that which at fir&s;t &s;eemed to be &s;eams or joynings of the Stones, are only veins in the Rock:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><P>The Figure of the Idol or <HI>Sphynx.</HI></P>
<P>The height of the <HI>Sphynx.</HI></P></NOTE> This Bur&s;t repre&s;ents the face and brea&s;t of a Woman, but it is prodigiou&s;ly high, being twenty &s;ix foot in height, fifteen foot from the ear to the chin, and yet all the proportions exactly ob&s;erved: Now what pro|bability is there to believe, that every day a man would take the pains, and venture the breaking of his neck, by de&s;cending into that Pit, that being at the bottom, he might only have the labour of coming up again, for there is no
<PB N="135" REF="87">
pa&s;&s;age there, as they who have gone down have ob&s;erved; a pa&s;&s;age mu&s;t have been cut in the Rock then, which would have co&s;t a great deal of Money, and been known of every Body. It were more probable to think that they entered it by the Hole, which (as I &s;aid) is in the pretended Temple of the &s;econd Pyramide, or rather by another, which is at the &s;ide of that Idol, and very near it. The&s;e two Holes are very narrow, and almo&s;t choaked up with Sand, wherefore we entred not into them, not knowing be&s;ides, but that we might meet with Vipers, or other Venemous Bea&s;ts in them. But though there had been a way through the Rocks into that Idol, how could the Voice of that feigned Oracle have come out, &s;ince there is no hole neither at the Mouth, No&s;e, Eyes, nor Ears of it? It may be &s;aid, perhaps, that the Voice was uttered by the Crown of the Head, where there is a Hole, into which we en|deavoured to have ca&s;t &s;ome Hooks fa&s;tened to Ropes, that I had brought pur|po&s;ely with me, that we might get up, but we could not compa&s;s that, be|cau&s;e of the height of it; only when we threw up Stones, they re&s;ted there. And a <HI>Venetian</HI> a&s;&s;ured me. that he and &s;ome others, having got up by means of little Hooks and a Pole, which they brought with them; they found a Hole in the Crown of the Head of it, and having entred therein. perceived that it drew narrower and narrower proportionably, as it approached to the Brea&s;t where it ended. The Voice of him that entred then, by the above|mentioned Holes, did not come out that way, and therefore it mu&s;t be con|cluded, that if any entred it, it mu&s;t have been by a Ladder in the Night-time, and that he put him&s;elf into the hole that is in the Head, out of which his Voice came.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. VI.</HI> Of the <HI>Mummies.</HI></HEAD>
<P>HAving viewed the Pyramides and Idol,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Sakara</HI> the Village of the <HI>Mummies.</HI></NOTE> we went and Lodged in the Vil|lage of the <HI>Mummies,</HI> called <HI>Sakara,</HI> three good Leagues from the Pyramides; we &s;poke to a <HI>Moor</HI> of the Village, who is the Ma&s;ter of the <HI>Mum|mies,</HI> that he would take care to have a <HI>Mummie</HI>-Pit opened for us again&s;t next Morning. He carried us to a Hou&s;e,<NOTE PLACE="marg">How People &s;leep at <HI>Sa|kara.</HI></NOTE> where we Supped on what we had brought along with us, and then went to re&s;t upon a little Ri&s;ing in the Court: When we were about to go out next Morning, they asked Money for Watching us (as they &s;aid) all Night; and it was to no purpo&s;e for us to tell them that we wanted none of their Watching, and that we had care enough to Guard our &s;elves; for all our Huffing was in vain, and there they &s;hut us in, till we gave a <HI>Pia&s;tre</HI> to be let out. They who would not be &s;o impo&s;ed upon, ought to lie abroad in the Fields; but that's not &s;afe, for they are very greedy of Money, and &s;pare not to do any thing &s;o they may come by it. And as they fancy, that the <HI>Franks</HI> carry always a good deal about them, when they have them in their Clutches, they &s;quee&s;e from them all they can. Wherefore when any one goes there, he ought to be well Accompanied, well Armed, and have a good &s;tout <HI>Janizary,</HI> and with all that, one mu&s;t not venture to beat them; for if he did, he would &s;oon have all the Rabble about his Ears. We parted then from that Village early in the Morning, with the Ma&s;ter of the <HI>Mummies,</HI> and went to the Plain where the <HI>Mummie</HI>-Pits are, a little way from the Village,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Memphis.</HI> The Field of <HI>Mummies.</HI> A lovely Py|ramide to|wards the place of the <HI>Mummies.</HI></NOTE> and (I think) it would be very convenient to &s;et out two Hours before day, to avoid the heat of the Sun, for there is no &s;helter there. This Plain begins near the place where the &s;tately City of <HI>Memphis</HI> heretofore &s;tood, of which &s;ome marks are &s;till to be &s;een near the <HI>Nile.</HI> There are &s;everal Pyramides in this Plain, and that for &s;everal Miles together; but not being very con&s;iderable, I &s;hall only &s;peak of a very fair one, which is four or five Miles from the Place, where they opened a <HI>Mummis</HI>-Pit for us. Having
<PB N="136" REF="88">
then agreed with the Ma&s;ter of the <HI>Mummies,</HI> that for eight <HI>Pia&s;tres</HI> he would open me a Pit,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Mummie</HI>-Pits.</NOTE> that had never been opened before, and paid him down the Money, for otherwi&s;e they would not work; he with two <HI>Moors,</HI> fell to the Bu&s;ine&s;s. Whil&s;t they were at work, we went to &s;ee the Pyramide, I men|tioned before, which would be nothing &s;hort of the beauty of the fir&s;t, if it had been fini&s;hed. We went up to the top before we entred it, as we did at the former; it has an Hundred and forty eight &s;teps, of large Stones like the other, the Platform of it is not even, the Stones being put together without order, which makes it ea&s;ily appear that it hath not been fini&s;hed, and yet it is much older than the other; as is evident by the Stones which are all worn out, and crumbled into Sand. It is Six hundred forty three Foot &s;quare, and hath its entry at the fourth part of its height, looking towards the North as the former; it hath on the Ea&s;t-&s;ide Three hundred and &s;ixteen Foot, and by con&s;equence, Three hundred twenty &s;even to the We&s;t. There is but one &s;ingle pa&s;&s;age into it, three Foot and a half broad, and four Foot high, which reaching Two hundred &s;ixty &s;even Foot downwards, ends in a Hall with a &s;teep Ridged Roof, Five and twenty Foot and a half in length, and eleven in breadth; in the corner of the Hall, there is another Pa&s;&s;age or Gallery, parallel to the Horizon, three Foot &s;quare within, and nine Foot and a half long, which leads to another Chamber, that is One and twenty Foot in length, and eleven in breadth, with a very high Ridged Roof al&s;o, having at the We&s;t-end a &s;quare Window, Twenty four Foot and two thirds rai&s;ed from the Floor, by which one enters into a pa&s;&s;age indifferent broad, and of a Mans height, Parallel to the Horizon, and reaching in length thirteen Foot and two Inches: There is a great Room, or Hall, at the end of this pa&s;&s;age, with a Ridged Roof, containing in length Twenty &s;ix Foot eight Inches, and in breadth Twenty four Foot and one Inch; the Floor of it is the natural Rock, which on all &s;ides is rough and unequal, leaving only a little &s;mooth and even &s;pace in the middle, encompa&s;&s;ed round with the Rock, and much lower than the entry into the Room, or the foundation of the Wall. When we had viewed this Pyramide, we returned to the <HI>Mummies,</HI> and found them digging our Pit; but they Cheated us (as they do many others) opening a Pit that had been twenty times opened before, though they &s;wore it was the fir&s;t time. Now this advantage is to be had by going down into a Pit never opened be|fore, that one may find Idols and other Curio&s;ities there; but when the&s;e Ra&s;cals find any thing, they keep it, that they may &s;ell it in the City to the <HI>Franks,</HI> and therefore never open a new Pit, but when they are alone. The&s;e Pits are &s;quare, and built of a pretty good Stone, but are full of Sand, which mu&s;t be taken out.<NOTE PLACE="marg">A de&s;cent in|to a <HI>Mummie</HI>-Pit.</NOTE> When they had removed the Sand, they let us down by a Rope made fa&s;t about our Middle, which was held by tho&s;e that were above, and the Pit was two or three Pikes length deep; being at the bottom, we crept through a little hole upon our Belly, becau&s;e they had not cleared it &s;ufficiently of the Sand, and entred into a little Room, walled and arched over with Stone. There we found three or four Bodies, but only ore that was entire, the re&s;t being broken into pieces, which ea&s;ily convinced us, that that Pit had been opened before. We were then for having that opened which was entire, but they would not, unle&s;s they were paid for it; and therefore I gave them a <HI>Pia&s;tre,</HI> which did not content them. But when they perceived that I was about to break it up in &s;pight of them, without giving them one Farthing more,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An entire bo|dy of a <HI>Mum|mie.</HI></NOTE> they beat it into pieces. This was a long and large Body, in a very thick Coffin of Wood, &s;hut clo&s;e on all hands; the Timber was not at all Rotten, and we found it to be Sycamore-Wood, which in <HI>Aegypt</HI> they call <HI>Pharoah</HI>'s Fig-Tree, that does not rot &s;o &s;oon as other Wood. Upon the Coffin,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Coffin of the <HI>Mummie.</HI> Stone Coffins.</NOTE> the Face of him that was within it, was cut in Embo&s;&s;ed Work. Some Coffins there are al&s;o of Stone, with the Face of the Per&s;on within, cut in Bo&s;s, and Hieroglyphicks all along the length of it. There are two of the&s;e Stones in the Hou&s;e of <HI>Mon&s;ieur Fouquet,</HI> at St. <HI>Mande,</HI> and I had two of them al&s;o, of which one was broken at <HI>Alexandria,</HI> and the other I brought Home with me very whole, which weighs betwixt Seaven and eight hundred weight.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Coffins made of Cloth.</NOTE> Some of the&s;e Coffins are made of &s;everal pieces of Cloth pa&s;ted together, which are as &s;trong as the Wooden ones. I have one
<PB N="137" REF="88">
of this kind in my Clo&s;et, made of above forty Cloths glewed or pa&s;ted toge|ther in thickne&s;s, which are not in the lea&s;t Rotten; it is covered all over with Idols and <HI>Hieroglyphicks,</HI> painted on a very thin Plai&s;ter, with which the out-&s;ide Cloth is dawbed over, but it is a little &s;poil'd, the Plai&s;ter in &s;ome places being rubbed off. Among the&s;e Figures, there is a Compartement at the lower end, two Inches broad, and a Foot long, being painted cro&s;s-ways over the Coffin; wherein may be &s;een the manner how the Ancient <HI>Aegyptians</HI> Embalmed dead Bodies. In the middle of this Compartement, there is a long Table &s;haped like a Lion, on the back of which the Body that is to be Embalmed is laid at length, and hard by there is a Man with a Knife in his Hand opening the Body; this Man hath on a Vizard-Mask, &s;haped like the Beak of a Sparrow-Hawk, which (without doubt) was the cu&s;tome of their Embalmers, who made u&s;e of that kind of Mask, that they might not breath in the Corruption that might evaporate from the dead Bodies, as the Phy&s;i|tians of <HI>Italy</HI> do at pre&s;ent, who in time of a Plague never &s;tir abroad without a Mask of this kind, in the long No&s;e of which they put Perfumes; though I make no doubt, but the Mask I &s;peak of, is the Head of <HI>O&s;iris,</HI> which the Aegyptians repre&s;ented with the Head of a Sparrow-Hawk, as they did <HI>Anubis</HI> with the Head of a Dog, the <HI>Nile</HI> with a Lions Head, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> But as a &s;urer mark that it is an Embalming, there are four Ve&s;&s;els without Handles upon the afore&s;aid Table, which could be nothing el&s;e but the Ve&s;&s;els wherein the ne|ce&s;&s;ary drugs were kept not only for the Embalming, as Balm, <HI>Cedria,</HI> &amp;c. but al&s;o for the wrapping up and Incru&s;tation of the Body, as <HI>Bitumen,</HI> and others; by the &s;ides of the Table, there are &s;everal Per&s;ons &s;tanding and &s;itting in divers po&s;tures. Within this Coffin is the figure of a naked Maid, with her Arms &s;treatched out.</P>
<P>But to return to my fir&s;t Di&s;cour&s;e, This Wooden Coffin I mentioned, be|ing broken to pieces with Hatchets, we found an entire Body in it, which lay in this manner.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The face of the <HI>Mummie.</HI> The Head of the <HI>Mummie.</HI></NOTE> The Face was covered (as commonly all the re&s;t are) with a kind of Head-piece of Cloth fitted with Plai&s;ter, on which the Countenance of that Per&s;on was repre&s;ented in Gold, and when we took off the Helmet, we found nothing of the Face remaining, which is commonly reduced to A&s;hes; I believe it is, becau&s;e it will not admit of Gumming &s;o well as the other parts of the Body. However I brought to <HI>Paris</HI> the Head of a <HI>Mummie,</HI> whole and entire, but it is all covered with Fillets of Cloth, &s;o neatly fitted,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Bandages <HI>Mummies.</HI></NOTE> that they hinder not but one may &s;ee the &s;hape of the Eyes, No&s;e, and Mouth. The re&s;t of the Body was &s;wathed with little Bands of Cloth very neatly made, but wrapped about with &s;o many ca&s;ts and turnings, that I believe there were above a Thou&s;and Ells in it; and certainly it is &s;o rare a way of Swathing and Binding, that I think it cannot be imitated at pre&s;ent, as many Chirurgeons have acknowledged to me. Along the Brea&s;t and Belly, there was a band of Cloth three good Fingers broad, and a large Foot and a half long, it was fa&s;t|ned to the other Bands, and upon it were &s;everal Hieroglyphicks done in Gold. I took this Writing and folded it, that I might the more conveniently carry it up with me. I hoped to have found Idols in that Coffin,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><P>Idols in the Coffins of the dead.</P>
<P>Idols within the dead bo|dies.</P>
<P>The Balm wherewith bodies were anointed in <HI>Aegypt.</HI></P></NOTE> knowing that they Interred many with their Dead, either of Stone, Copper, or Green Earth, as I have &s;everal that have been found in the&s;e Bodies, but finding none, I thought there might be &s;ome within his Body; for after they had Emboweled them, they pretty often enclo&s;ed Idols within their Bellies; for that end I had it broken up, but we could find nothing. I con&s;idered then that Balm which is now quite lo&s;t, it is Black, hard and &s;hines like Pitch, having much &s;uch a &s;mell, but more plea&s;ant, that kept Bodies entire, and (I believe) the Sand contributed not a little thereto; for even in the great De&s;arts of <HI>Arabia,</HI> &s;ometimes the dead Bodies of Men and Dogs are found entire, who falling a&s;leep, and &s;taying behind the Caravans,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Bodies pre|&s;erved in Sand.</NOTE> are covered over with an ocean of Sand driven by the high Winds, in which the Bodies being buried, are by the drine&s;s and &s;alt that is in the Sand, which dries up all the humidity of them, pre&s;erved entire, and are afterwards found, when another Wind blowing, carries off the Sand again. Many think that the Bodies &s;o dried, are the true <HI>Mummie;</HI> it is a mi&s;take, and that which Merchants bring into Chri&s;tendom, to be u&s;ed in Medicine, is the <HI>Mummie</HI> we fir&s;t de&s;cribed. Near the Room I
<PB N="138" REF="89">
went in to, there were &s;everal others full of Bodies, but &s;eeing the entries into them were full of Sand,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rooms full of bodies in the <HI>Mummies.</HI></NOTE> I called to them above to pull me up again with the &s;ame Rope, with which I was let down, being much di&s;&s;atisfied with my <HI>Moors,</HI> who had opened &s;o &s;orry a Pit for me. When I was got up I looked upon my Cloth, whereon were Characters of Gold, but was much vexed to &s;ee that all the Letters di&s;appeared, and that by my own fault, becau&s;e I had folded it together when it was very humid, and &s;o all the Gold and Paint &s;tuck to the oppo&s;ite &s;ides; whereas I &s;hould have brought it up open and dried it in the Sun. But I have others that are finer. which are only a little &s;poilt in the bringing: I brought with me al&s;o &s;ome Hands of <HI>Mummies,</HI> which are as entire at pre&s;ent, as ever they were. I had al&s;o the good fortune to buy upon the place &s;ome Idols, of the <HI>Moors,</HI> who come and &s;ell them to the <HI>Franks</HI> in the City.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Idols of <HI>Mummies.</HI></NOTE> The&s;e Idols are of &s;everal &s;orts, and in many Po&s;tures, there are of them of Copper, of &s;everal &s;orts of Stone, and &s;everal &s;orts of Earth al&s;o; at lea&s;t, I have &s;ome of all the&s;e kinds, all which I am very &s;ure have been taken out of <HI>Mummies,</HI> and cannot be &s;aid to be counterfeit, for be&s;ides that, they have not the Art to do it, they &s;ell them at &s;o ea&s;ie a rate, that the very Materials are worth more.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The rea&s;on of the Egyp|tians expen&s;|fulne&s;s in their Tombs.</NOTE> This is all I could ob&s;erve of the Pyra|mides and <HI>Mummies:</HI> And hence it appears, that the Ancient Aegyptians &s;pent more in their Tombs, than during their whole Lives; and one rea&s;on they gave for that was, That their Hou&s;es were only for living a &s;hort time in, and their Tombs the Palaces that were to be inhabited by their Souls for many Ages.

There is a thick Pillar al&s;o in this Church, to which an Iron Chain is fa&s;tned, which they &s;ay, was St. <HI>George</HI>'s; and they tie Mad-men to it to be Cured. This Mona&s;tery is Inhabited by Greek Nuns, it is very Ancient, well Built, and exceeding high, having a place on the top of it, that affords a very di&s;tant Pro&s;pect: But we mu&s;t take notice withal, that this Mona&s;tery is &s;o full of Fleas, that &s;o &s;oon as you have &s;et foot within, you are covered all over with them; and &s;eeing they are very lean, they quickly crawl up, and fall on. Near to this Mona&s;tery is the Church-yard, where the <HI>Franks</HI> are In|terred,

I went once up to that Aqueduct, and there|fore I'll give an account of what I &s;aw: You mu&s;t a&s;cend thirty or forty broad Steps, which are very ea&s;ie to mount, before you come to the top, where you &s;ee eight <HI>Sakis</HI> turned all by Oxen, that di&s;charge their Water into a great Ba|&s;on, from whence it runs through a little Conduit-pipe into the Aqueduct, at &s;ix Paces di&s;tance, and therein is conveyed to the Ca&s;tle.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. VIII.</HI> Of the <HI>Matharee.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE <HI>Matharee</HI> is two &s;hort Leagues from New <HI>Caire;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Matharee.</NOTE> it is a lovely and plea&s;ant place, and de&s;erves to be &s;een, were it for nothing el&s;e, but that it hath been Honoured with the pre&s;ence of our Saviour; for they &s;ay that our Lady lived &s;ome time there with her Son <HI>Je&s;us.</HI> You &s;ee in it a little Hall almo&s;t &s;quare, which heretofore was a bare Grott, but at pre&s;ent is en|clo&s;ed by a Garden, that is carefully lookt after: As you enter into that Hall, there is on the Left hand a Ba&s;on even with the Floor, &s;omewhat longer than broad; a Water runs into it (where it is &s;aid) the Ble&s;&s;ed Virgin wa&s;hed her Linnen, and in the mean time &s;et our Saviour upon a little Window hollowed in the Wall, where the Monks &s;ometimes &s;ay Ma&s;s. The Water that comes into the Ba&s;on of that Hall, and all over the Garden, is drawn by two Oxen, that turn a <HI>Saki</HI> in the Court, by means whereof they rai&s;e the Water. Many have &s;aid that this Water comes from the <HI>Nile,</HI> being not far di&s;tant (e&s;pe|cially when it overflows) and a few others affirm it to be a Spring, of which opinion I am. For if it were the Water of the <HI>Nile,</HI> they that live there mu&s;t needs know it, but they &s;ay it is a Spring. Be&s;ides, when the Water of the <HI>Nile</HI> is thicke&s;t, this is very clear, as it is at all times: And in &s;hort, the Etymologie of the word <HI>Matharee,</HI> &s;eems to in&s;inuate that it is a Spring;<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Etymo|logie of <HI>Ma|tharee.</HI></NOTE> for the word <HI>Matharee</HI> comes from <HI>Matariih,</HI> which &s;ignifies Fre&s;h-water. And why would they give it that name more than to all other Gardens where there are <HI>Sakis,</HI> if the meaning were not that there was a good &s;pring of Fre&s;h|water there? <HI>Saki</HI> &s;ignifies a Watering-place,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Saki.</NOTE> and is the &s;ame that in <HI>Province</HI> they call a <HI>Pou&s;erague.</HI> Having &s;een that Hall, you go into a Garden walled in al&s;o, where there are many Trees, but among others, a very old <HI>Sycamore,</HI> or Fig-Tree of <HI>Pharaoh,</HI> which yearly bears Fruit. They &s;ay, that our Lady pa&s;&s;ing by it with her Son <HI>Je&s;us,</HI> and being pur&s;ued by Men, the Fig-Tree opened, and the Ble&s;&s;ed Virgin going into it, it &s;hut again till the Men were pa&s;t, and then it opened again, and continued always &s;o until the Year 1656. that the piece which was &s;eparated from the Trunk was broken off. This is a pretty plea&s;ant Garden to re&s;t in, and commonly they Dine there in a Walk &s;haded with Orange and Limon-Trees, that are in &s;o great number, and ca&s;t &s;uch a &s;hade, that the Sun pa&s;&s;es not at all through them, and you mu&s;t &s;toop very low when you go in &s;ome of the Walks, which have in the middle Chan|nels made to convey the water all over the Garden, and they can bring the

water into any Walk you are in, where you may cool your Wine; but if you have a mind to eat any thing there, you mu&s;t bring it with you; for you'l find nothing in the place but plenty of fair Oranges,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An Obelisk near the Gar|den of <HI>Matha|ree.</HI></NOTE> and &s;mall Limons. There is a very lovely great Obelisk pretty near to this Garden, like to that which &s;tands at <HI>Alexandria,</HI> and tho&s;e others that are in <HI>Rome</HI> and other places. Many think that there has been &s;ome Town heretofore in this place, &s;eeing there are Ruines &s;till to be &s;een about it, and that it is not likely &s;uch a piece would have been erected in the open Fields. This Obelisk &s;tands in a very low ground, where there is always water, and e&s;pecially during the Inundation of <HI>Nile,</HI> that the whole place looks like a Pond. In this place it was that <HI>Selim</HI> encamped his Army when he took <HI>Caire;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Camp of <HI>Selim,</HI> when he be&s;ieged <HI>Caire.</HI></NOTE> and there are very high works of Earth &s;till to be &s;een, where his Trenches were.

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. IX.</HI> Of the Ca&s;tle.</HEAD>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Ca&s;tle of <HI>Caire.</HI></NOTE>THE Ca&s;tle of <HI>Caire</HI> is one of the fine&s;t things in <HI>Aegypt;</HI> it &s;tands upon a Hill, not in the middle of the City (as many have written,) but without the Town, almo&s;t at one of the points of the Cre&s;cent which the City makes, and in a manner over again&s;t Old <HI>Caire.</HI> It is founded on a Rock, and encompa&s;&s;ed with very high and thick Walls: The a&s;cent to this Ca&s;tle is by a pair of &s;tairs cut out in the Rock, &s;o ea&s;ie to mount, that Hor&s;es and Camels go up it with their Loads. There is a very large Place or Square before the Ca&s;tle, called the <HI>Rome&s;le;</HI> and near that place, the <HI>Mo&s;que</HI> called <HI>Sultan Ha&s;an,</HI> becau&s;e it was built by <HI>Sultan Ha&s;an</HI> in the time of the <HI>Mamalukes.</HI> This Mo&s;que is all of Free|&s;tone,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Mo&s;que of <HI>Sultan Ha|&s;an,</HI> at <HI>Caire.</HI></NOTE> extraordinarily well built, and prodigiou&s;ly high. <HI>Thomambey,</HI> the la&s;t King of the <HI>Mamalukes,</HI> fled to this Mo&s;que, leaving the Ca&s;tle to <HI>Sultan Selim,</HI> who fired &s;everal Guns at the Mo&s;que, where the holes of the Bullets are &s;till to be &s;een, e&s;pecially in the Dome that is pierced all through by them. In this Ca&s;tle are many &s;tately Ruines, and &s;everal fair Vaults hid under ground. We find indeed, that the anciente&s;t things fall into greate&s;t ruine, and are not exempted from the power of time. It is certain that the greate&s;t and be&s;t part of this Ca&s;tle is ruined, and yet &s;everal fair Buildings remain &s;till: But the fine&s;t and mo&s;t curious thing that is to be &s;een in the Ca&s;tle, is <HI>Jo&s;eph</HI>'s Well, which is certainly a Wonder; one mu&s;t have leave from the <HI>Ba&s;ha Chiaoux</HI> to &s;ee it, and the French Con&s;uls Interpreter having asked it for us, he gave him a man to conduct us thither; but however it co&s;t us five or &s;ix Pia&s;tres, This Pit or Well is divided into two &s;tories, or (to &s;ay better) into two Pits; the fir&s;t is almo&s;t &s;quare, and is eleven foot long, and ten foot broad; there is a pair of &s;tairs to go down to it, about &s;even or eight foot broad, cut in the Rock all round, and &s;eparating the Pit from the Rock; &s;o that when you go down, you have one of the &s;ides of the Well on the right hand, which &s;erves for a rail to keep one from falling, or indeed, &s;eeing into the Well, unle&s;s it be by windows that are at convenient di&s;tances, On the left hand, you have the wall, which is the Rock it &s;elf. This Stair-ca&s;e hath been made very ea&s;ie to go down and up, for the convenience of the Oxen that go down to labour, &s;o that the de&s;cent is hardly &s;en&s;ible. You go down then 220 &s;teps, finding on each &s;ide of the Pit two windows, each about three foot &s;quare; there are three windows in &s;ome places,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A hole in <HI>Jo|&s;eph</HI>'s Well, that goes to the Pyra|mides.</NOTE> but the Pit being very deep, they are not &s;ufficient to give light enough, and therefore &s;ome Torches mu&s;t be carried down. At the bottom of the&s;e two hundred and twenty &s;teps, in the Rock on the left hand, there is a great hole like a door, but &s;topt up, and (they &s;ay) that that hole goes as far
<PB N="141" REF="90">
as the Pyramides.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Another hole in <HI>Jo&s;ephs</HI> Well, which the <HI>Aegyptians</HI> &s;ay, reaches as far as <HI>Suez.</HI></NOTE> There is another hole like the former on the right hand of the Pit, and &s;topt up in the &s;ame manner, and that (they &s;ay) goes as far as <HI>Suez</HI> upon the Red-Sea; but I believe neither of the two. Turning then to the right hand towards that hole, you come to a place which is the bottome of the fir&s;t Pit or &s;tory; this place an&s;wers perpendicularly to the mouth of the Pit, being equal to it in length and breadth, &s;o much of it as is uncovered; for after|wards it &s;trikes off to the right hand under the Rock, to the place of the &s;econd &s;tory or &s;econd Pit, which is narrow, but deeper than the former: At the top of this la&s;t Pit, in the afore-mentioned place that goes under the Rock, the Oxen are, which by means of wheels, draw a great quantity of water out of this narrow Pit or Well, which falling into a Channel, runs into a re&s;ervatory at one end of this place, and at the bottom of the fir&s;t Pit; from whence at the &s;ame time it is conveyed up on high by little buckets fa&s;tened to a rope, which Oxen on the top continually keep going, by the means of other wheels that they turn, and then it is di&s;tributed through the Ca&s;tle in &s;everal pipes. One may go to the bottome of this narrow Well, there being &s;everal &s;teps in it, by which &s;ome have de&s;cended; but there is too much mud and &s;lime in it. Now (what is mo&s;t wonderful) all this Pit or Well is made out of the hard Rock, to a prodigious breadth and depth, and the water of it is from a Spring, there being no Spring (to the knowledge of man) in all <HI>Aegypt,</HI> but this,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Onely two Springs of Water in <HI>Ae|gypt.</HI></NOTE> and that of the <HI>Matharee,</HI> which we mentioned before. Many, and almo&s;t all the <HI>Franks</HI> think, that the water of <HI>Jo&s;eph</HI>'s Well, is the &s;ame that is brought from the <HI>Nile</HI> in that fair Aqueduct which comes by Old <HI>Caire</HI> to the Ca&s;tle: But we informed our&s;elves as to that of many in the Ca&s;tle, who all a&s;&s;ured us, that the water that is brought by that Aqueduct, &s;erved only for the <HI>Ba&s;has</HI> Hor&s;es, (as indeed it comes &s;treight to the Stables in the <HI>Ba&s;has</HI> Appartment,) and that it enters not at all into <HI>Jo&s;eph</HI>'s Well, which is in the Quarter of the <HI>Janizaries;</HI> be&s;ides, the water of <HI>Jo&s;eph</HI>'s Well is &s;weeti&s;h, (as the water of mo&s;t Wells is) and differs in ta&s;te from that of the <HI>Nile.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><P><HI>Jo&s;eph</HI>'s Hall.

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. XI.</HI> Of the Ovens that hatch Chickens.</HEAD>
<P>ALL that I have related hitherto, are &s;uch things as may be daily &s;een, and whoever Travels into that Countrey, may &s;ee them at his lei&s;ure, when he thinks fit. But there are al&s;o &s;everal other curious things that are ca&s;ual and temporary; and others again, which yearly happen but at &s;uch a time and &s;ea&s;on. I &s;hall relate what I have &s;een of both, according to the order of time they happen in, and I &s;aw them. The fir&s;t of the&s;e extraordi|nary things I &s;aw at <HI>Caire,</HI> was the artificial way of hatching Chickens; one would think it a Fable, at fir&s;t, to &s;ay that Chickens are hatch'd, without Hens &s;itting upon the Eggs; and a greater, to &s;ay, that they are &s;old by the Bu&s;hel: Neverthele&s;s both are true, and for that effect, they put their Eggs in Ovens, which they heat with &s;o temperate a warmth,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The manner of the Ovens for hatching of Chickens.</NOTE> which imitates &s;o well the natural heat, that Chickens are formed and hatched in them. The&s;e Ovens are in a low place, and in a manner under ground; they are made of Earth, round within, the Hearth or Floor of them being covered all over with Tow or Flocks to put the Eggs upon. There are in all twelve of the&s;e Ovens, &s;ix on each &s;ide in two ranks or &s;tories, there being two &s;tories on each &s;ide, and three Ovens in each &s;torie. The&s;e two &s;ides are &s;eparated by a Street or Way, through which they who work in them (who are all <HI>Cophtes</HI>) and tho&s;e that come to &s;ee them, pa&s;s. They begin to heat their Ovens about the middle of <HI>February,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">How the O|vens are hea|ted.</NOTE> and continue to do &s;o for almo&s;t four months &s;pace. They heat them with a very temperate heat, only of the hot a&s;hes of Oxen and Camels-dung, or the like, which they put at the mouth of each Oven, and daily change it, put|ting fre&s;h hot dung into the &s;ame place. This they do for the &s;pace of ten days, and then lay the Eggs upon the Tow and Flocks that are within the Ovens, ranking them all round; and they'll put about eight thou&s;and in an Oven. After twelve days time that the Eggs have been there, the Chickens are hatch'd, and come out; &s;o that the time of heating the Ovens, and the time the Eggs have been in them, make in all two and twenty days: But it is plea&s;ant to &s;ee the&s;e Chickens, in one &s;ide &s;ome thru&s;ting out their heads, others &s;tri|ving and &s;truggling to get out their bodies, and others again (which on the other &s;ide are quite out of the &s;hell) tripping up and down upon the re&s;t of the Eggs; for if you &s;tay there but the lea&s;t, you'll &s;ee all the&s;e progre&s;&s;es. When they are all hatched, they gather them up, mea&s;ure them in a Bu&s;hel that wants a bottom, and &s;ell them by that mea&s;ure to all that plea&s;e to buy, and then divide the profit betwixt the Owners and the Ma&s;ters of the Ovens. During the four months that they plie this bu&s;ine&s;s, they u&s;e above three hundred thou|&s;and Eggs, but all do not &s;ucceed. Such as have a very nice palate, think that the&s;e Pullets are not &s;o good as tho&s;e which are hatched by a Hen, but the dif|ference is but little, or rather it is only in fancy; and it is &s;till very much to imitate Nature &s;o near. Many think that this cannot be done but in <HI>Aegypt,</HI> becau&s;e of the warmth of the Climate; but the Great Duke of <HI>Florence</HI> having &s;ent for one of the&s;e Men, he hatched them a&s;wel there as in <HI>Aegypt:</HI> The &s;ame al&s;o (as I was told) had been done in <HI>Poland;</HI> and I certainly believe it may be done any where, provided it be in &s;ome place under ground, where no Air comes in; but the great difficulty is to proportion the heat to &s;uch a temperate degree, that there be neither too much nor too little, either of which would prove un&s;uccesful.</P>

<P>IT is &s;trange to &s;ee the Super&s;titions that reign among People, and there is no Country that can pretend to be free from them; only &s;ome have more, and &s;ome le&s;s; but the &s;trange&s;t thing of all is that they will not be undeceived, and if any man offer to lay open the Cheat, he is pre&s;ently taken for an Athei&s;t and wicked Per&s;on.

I went to that Burying-place on the Holy <HI>Friday</HI> of the Greeks and other Chri&s;tians, who follow the old Calendar, that I might &s;ee what Ground they had for this &s;tupid Belief; and I was a&s;toni&s;hed to find as many People there as if it had been at a Fair, for all both &s;mall and great in <HI>Caire</HI> flock thither, and the Turks go in proce&s;&s;ion with all their Ban|ners, becau&s;e they have a <HI>Scheikh</HI> Interred there, who&s;e Bones (as they &s;ay) come out every year, and take the Air with the re&s;t; and there they &s;ay their Prayers with great Devotion.

All the Families of the <HI>Beys</HI> pa&s;t, then the <HI>Chiaoux,</HI> next the <HI>Azapes,</HI> then the <HI>Janizaries,</HI> and after them the <HI>Beys,</HI> of whom he that was the <HI>Emir-Adge,</HI> had a <HI>Caftan,</HI> which he had received from the <HI>Ba&s;ha,</HI> as many other Officers had, who were to be there. After them came the <HI>Janizaries</HI> of the Divan, who were followed by Men carrying four very long pieces of Crim&s;on Velvet, Embroidered all over with Arabick Letters of Gold, as long, broad, and thick as ones Finger: Others carried a large and long Door-piece of Velvet, Embroidered in the &s;ame manner; and then came a Camel well Harne&s;&s;ed, carrying a great Pavillion, or Tabernacle, of Crim&s;on-Satin, all Embroidered with Gold, and chiefly in &s;ome places, where there were great long letters Embroidered in Gold; it was &s;haped like a Bell, with a Gilt Ball over the top, and four &s;uch others about it: Then another little &s;quare Pa|villion of far le&s;s value, carried by a Man; after that came eight pieces of Searge, and a Man with a burden of Ropes. All the&s;e things were for adorn|ing the <HI>Kiabe,</HI> or Mo&s;que of <HI>Mecha,</HI> and were accompanied by many Proce&s;|&s;ions with Banners, and all the <HI>Santo's,</HI> with &s;everal Drums and Timbrels. But &s;trange was the pre&s;&s;ing and crowding of the People, to touch all the things that were &s;ent in Pre&s;ent; every one &s;trove to get near, and tho&s;e who were &s;o happy, touched them mo&s;t devoutly with the ends of their Fin|gers, nay, not &s;o much as the Ropes that were Con&s;ecrated to that holy place, but were touched with as much re&s;pect and devotion as the re&s;t; and they, who becau&s;e of the Crowd could not come near, got up upon &s;ome Stone, and undoing their Turban, threw one end of it upon the Relicks, and held the other in their Hand to pull it back by; &s;o that if they could touch them with any thing that they could afterwards ki&s;s, they were &s;atisfied.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The re&s;pect of the Maho|metans for the Pre&s;ents that are &s;ent to <HI>Mecha.</HI></NOTE> They have the &s;ame Reverence for the&s;e things that Catholicks have for their Relicks, and that only becau&s;e they are to be pre&s;ented to the <HI>Kiabe,</HI> for adorning that place which they e&s;teem holy. All tho&s;e things were carri|ed from the Ca&s;tle to the Hou&s;e of the <HI>Emir-Adge.</HI> Two days after, to wit, <HI>Monday</HI> the twenty third of <HI>July,</HI> the <HI>Emir-Adge</HI> went out of the Town, that he might Encamp abroad, and prepare for the Journey to <HI>Mecha;</HI> it was much the &s;ame as at the other Cavalcades, as for the order of the Families of the <HI>Beys,</HI> the <HI>Chiaoux,</HI> and the re&s;t.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Six Field-pieces for the Journey of <HI>Mecha.</HI></NOTE> But there was this more in this la&s;t Caval|cade, that after the Families of the <HI>Beys,</HI> came &s;ix Field-pieces, every one of them drawn by two Hor&s;es; which the <HI>Emir-Adge</HI> always carries with him in that Expedition. There were be&s;ides a great many little Children, &s;ome mounted on Camels, &s;ome on Hor&s;es, and all in <HI>Caftans</HI> pre&s;ented to them; the&s;e were the Sons of the <HI>Emir-Adge</HI>'s Cooks, Grooms, and other Officers. The fir&s;t of the&s;e little Boys was the Son of the Smith, who goes to &s;hooe the Hor&s;es, Mules, and A&s;&s;es of the Caravan; and as a &s;ign of that, he was

upon a Camel covered with a very pretty Pavillion, and had on the Camels back before him an Anvil, with a great Hammer in his Hand, wherewith he now and then &s;truck upon the Anvil. Then pa&s;&s;ed a great many Camels load|ed with Provi&s;ions for the <HI>Emir-Adge,</HI> after them came the <HI>Beys,</HI> and then the <HI>Emir-Adge.</HI> A quarter of an Hour after, came all the <HI>Santo's,</HI> or Mad-men, in far greater number than ever I had &s;een in any place; &s;ome Dancing, others making a thou&s;and wry Mouths and &s;trange Faces, and clad in divers Fa&s;hions, much like our Ma&s;quers in time of Carnaval: Then at length came the ble&s;&s;ed Camel, which carries the Pavillion I mentioned before; the other things were under that Pavillion, and horrible was the crowding to get near and ki&s;s, or at lea&s;t touch that &s;ame Pavillion.

It is wonderful to &s;ee how many People come yearly from all places, to perform that Journey; for there are five Caravans, to wit, that of <HI>Caire,</HI> which con&s;i&s;ts of Aegyptians, and of all that come from <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> and the places about; that of <HI>Da|ma&s;cus,</HI> wherein go from <HI>Syria,</HI> all who have a mind to go; that of the <HI>Magre|bins,</HI> or We&s;terlings, comprehending tho&s;e of <HI>Barbary, Fez,</HI> and <HI>Morocco,</HI> who meet at <HI>Caire;</HI> the Caravan of <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> and that of the <HI>Indies,</HI> or the <HI>Mogul.</HI> But, in my opinion, they who come from <HI>Fez</HI> and <HI>Morocco,</HI> are put to the greate&s;t trouble; for they Travel always by Land, over great De&s;arts, that takes them up a long time, and indeed, they employ a whole Year in the Journey, and more than one half of them die by the way. This Caravan of <HI>Caire</HI> was very numerous, for in it there was four <HI>Beys,</HI> one Janizary <HI>Aga&s;i,</HI> one <HI>Bo&s;tangi Ba&s;ha,</HI> and &s;everal other mighty Lords, who made the Journey, having all a great many Camels with them. As for the <HI>Emir-Adge,</HI> who tra|vels that Journey yearly, and is chief of the Caravan, he has commonly Fifteen hundred Camels to carry his Baggage, and to &s;ell, or let to tho&s;e who want; for many die by the way: He hath Five hundred Camels to carry Water, only for his Family, and they load them with Fre&s;h-water, whereever they find any. This Caravan (as it was &s;aid) con&s;i&s;ted of about an Hundred thou&s;and Per|&s;ons, and of above an Hundred thou&s;and Bea&s;ts, as well Camels as Hor&s;es, Mules and A&s;&s;es, and that &s;eemed indeed, to be a great deal; but we were informed afterward by the Gentleman of the Hor&s;e to the <HI>Bey</HI> of <HI>Suez,</HI> that that Cara|van con&s;i&s;ted only of Eight thou&s;and Camels, and that when it amounts to Fifteen thou&s;and Camels, it is thought to be very great.</P>

It is very pretty to &s;ee them Encamped in the Night-time, becau&s;e of

the infinite number of Lamps that are in the Tents and Pavillions. Next day, the Ninth of <HI>August,</HI> the Caravan of the <HI>Magrebins</HI> parted al&s;o from the <HI>Birque,</HI> and there all of <HI>Barbary</HI> who intend to make the Journey, meet, and make a di&s;tinct Caravan; which depends not on the <HI>Emir-Adge</HI> of <HI>Caire,</HI> but have a Chief of their own. That Caravan never &s;ets out but a day after the Caravan of <HI>Caire;</HI> they travel commonly by night, and re&s;t in the day time,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Caravans travel only by night.</NOTE> as all other Caravans do that go to other places, that &s;o they may avoid the heat, which is almo&s;t in&s;upportable; and when the Moon does not &s;hine, there are Men who carry Links before the Caravan.

<P><HI>Mecha</HI> is about the bigne&s;s of <HI>Mar&s;eilles,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Kiaabe.

The Thre&s;hold of the Door is as high from the ground as a Man can reach his hand, being within filled up even with the Thre&s;hold. The Door is about a fathom and an half high, and a fathom wide, and is in the corner to the left hand, when one faces the Hou&s;e: This Door is of beaten Silver, and opens with two leaves; they go up to it by a Ladder &s;upported by four Wheels, two wherof are fa&s;tened to the lower end of the Ladder, and the other two to two wooden Po&s;ts about the middle of it, by means of which Wheels the Ladder is run to the wall, when any body is to enter into the <HI>Beytullah.</HI></P>
<P>This Hou&s;e has a flat Roof, &s;upported by three Pillars of an Octogone Fi|gure, which are of <HI>Aloes</HI>-Wood, as big as the Body of a Man, and about three

<P>The Mahometans believe, that after <HI>Adam</HI> and <HI>Eve</HI> had &s;inned, God as a puni&s;hment &s;eparated them, making them wander over the World like Vaga|bonds, and that after many Years, they met on the top of this Hillock, the one coming from the Ea&s;t, and the other from the We&s;t; there they &s;topt, and after they had continued in &s;ome &s;u&s;pence, before they knew one another, calling to mind what had formerly pa&s;t betwixt them,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The return of <HI>Adam</HI> and <HI>Eve.</HI></NOTE> they came to know one another, Saying <HI>Arof, Arof,</HI> which in the Arabick Tongue, &s;ignifies I know, I know; and from thence that place hath had the name of <HI>Arafa.</HI> In memory whereof the Turks believe, that God made the two Fountains gu&s;h out of the two &s;ides of that Hillock, which are to be &s;een at pre&s;ent, the &s;treams of the one running Ea&s;tward, and of the other We&s;tward.</P>
<P>The Pilgrims then being all a&s;&s;embled in this Plain, about half an Hour, or a quarter of an Hour before Sun-&s;etting, they make a long Prayer, lifting up their hands to Heaven, and imploring the Mercy of God, for the Remi&s;&s;ion of their &s;ins (which they hope to obtain) as they believe God pardoned our fir&s;t Parents, in the &s;ame place, and at the &s;ame hour. The Prayer being ended, the Pilgrims make ha&s;te to be gone,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The place of <HI>Abraham</HI>'s Sa|crifice.</NOTE> and without looking behind them by the way, return and lie at the afore&s;aid <HI>Myne,</HI> which is a Village in the middle of another Plain, where there is a Rock, in which they hold that <HI>Abraham</HI> made his Sacrifice. There is a Cave in that Rock, where the Mahometans &s;ay their Prophet often prayed, nay, and &s;hew in the upper part of the Cave a dent, that repre&s;ents the Crown of a Man's Head, which they affirm was made there, when <HI>Mahomet</HI> ri&s;ing up after he had been pro&s;trate in that place, &s;truck his head again&s;t the Roof of the Cave which was a little low, and that the Stone became &s;oft like Wax; the figure of the head having remained there ever &s;ince. They have built a Mo&s;que in that place, part of which &s;tands upon that Rock, and enclo&s;es the &s;aid Cave, which makes this place to be held in great Venera|tion, be&s;ides the Devotion they pay to it becau&s;e of <HI>Abraham</HI>'s Sacrifice; in commemoration whereof on the day of the little <HI>Bairam,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Sacrifice of the Maho|metans.</NOTE> the Pilgrims &s;acrifice in the Plain, above Four hundred thou&s;and Sheep, and &s;tay there till about Noon the third day of the &s;aid <HI>Bairam,</HI> when all begin to di&s;lodge and return to <HI>Mecha.</HI></P>

This <HI>Khalis</HI> is a low Street, that goes quite through the City of <HI>Caire,</HI> beginning at the <HI>Nile</HI> towards old <HI>Caire,</HI> and ending in the Fields to|wards St. <HI>Michaels.</HI> When the River begins to &s;well, they ca&s;t up a Bank of Earth at that end of the Street which is near the <HI>Nile,</HI> to keep the Water from running into the <HI>Khalis,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Khalis.</NOTE> and when it is high enough, they cut through that bank of Earth, and give the Water pa&s;&s;age in the <HI>Khalis</HI> through the Town. When the Ba&s;ha is at <HI>Caire,</HI> it is performed with great Ceremony, and many Fire|works. In the Year, 1657. there was no Ceremony, no more than the Year before, but the Year after, I &s;aw that Fe&s;tival with all the Rejoycings; as I &s;hall hereafter relate in order. In the mean time I'll here tell, how I &s;aw it in the Year,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The cutting of the <HI>Khalis</HI> by the <HI>Sou&s;|ba&s;ha.</HI></NOTE> 1657. <HI>Thur&s;day</HI> the ninth of <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> the <HI>Sousba&s;ha</HI> attended by his Guards, and two Men mounted on Camels, and beating upon Timbrels, went to the end of the <HI>Khalis</HI> towards the <HI>Nile,</HI> where being come, he alighted from his Hor&s;e, and gave the fir&s;t blow to the breaking of the Bank with a Hammer, then he took Hor&s;e again, and whil&s;t &s;everal <HI>Moors</HI> that were there, broke down all the Bank, he went along the <HI>Khalis</HI> almo&s;t an Hour before the Water came; he &s;topt before the Hou&s;es of the Con&s;uls of the <HI>Franks,</HI> who have back Doors and Windows that look into the <HI>Khalis,</HI> and received a due
<PB N="159" REF="99">
of &s;ome <HI>Pia&s;tres,</HI> which that day is payed him by the&s;e Con&s;uls, and then went on his way. Then came a crowd of the Rabble, &s;ome Singing, and others pelting one another with Cudgels. Some time after came the Water, which was &s;ignified to us by a great Noi&s;e of rogui&s;h <HI>Moors,</HI> both Men and little Boys that came along in it, keeping pace with the Water; &s;ome Swam, and others threw one another into it, playing a thou&s;and fooli&s;h Tricks. This <HI>Khalis</HI> filled up fifteen Foot high, and all the time it was running, there came Boats full of Merry Sparks who diverted them&s;elves, Singing and Playing on In&s;tru|ments, as they pa&s;&s;ed along. As the <HI>Nile</HI> cea&s;es to ri&s;e in the beginning of <HI>October,</HI> &s;o the <HI>Khalis</HI> leaves off to run about the end of the &s;ame Month; and therefore in the &s;aid Month of <HI>October,</HI> Proclamation is made in all the Streets,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><P><HI>Sakas.</HI> The <HI>Sakas</HI> prohibited to take Water out of che <HI>Khalis</HI> when it runs no more.</P>

But when it has done running, there is a mo&s;t noi&s;ome &s;mell, not only becau&s;e of the corruption of that &s;tanding Water, but al&s;o becau&s;e of all the filth and na&s;ty &s;tuff, that they who have Windows upon the <HI>Khalis</HI> throw into it, be&s;ides all the Carrion. In &s;hort, the Infection is &s;o great, that not only the Money and Plate in the Hou&s;es that are near to the <HI>Khalis,</HI> is tarni&s;hed, but al&s;o the Pictures and Painting are &s;poil'd; as I have &s;een in &s;everal Hou&s;es, which neverthele&s;s recovered their former beauty, when the <HI>Khalis</HI> was dry. When I arrived at <HI>Caire,</HI> the <HI>Kha|lis</HI> was in this manner full of &s;tanding Water, and being told that it was the <HI>Khalis</HI> of which I had heard &s;o much talk, I had the curio&s;ity to look into it out of a Window; it was then Morning, and the Water was &s;o thick, that the &s;urface of it &s;eemed to be all porphyrie, appearing Green, Blew, Red, and of all Colours: But when the Sun had &s;hone a little upon it, and di&s;&s;olved that &s;cum, I was &s;oon undeceived; for the &s;cent which is &s;melt at a great di&s;tance, made me well know what it was, and I have often wondred, that the horrible infe|ction of it, does not occa&s;ion a Plague every Year. If the <HI>Sousba&s;ha</HI> plea&s;ed,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Sousba&s;ha</HI> lets the water of the <HI>Khalis</HI> &s;tand and corrupt for his own profit.

When then they have a mind to dry the <HI>Khalis,</HI> they ca&s;t up Dams in &s;everal places of it, and throw the Water from one into another, and afterward take it out and &s;ell it. When a good deal of the Water hath been taken out, the Ground drys very &s;oon; and when it is very dry, which happens in the Month of <HI>May</HI> (at lea&s;t in the Year, 1657. it was compleatly dry by the middle of <HI>May</HI>) they &s;et Men to work with Pick-axes to level the Ground, in tho&s;e places where heaps of Earth are ca&s;t up; &s;o that the Street being full of ups and downs,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Nile</HI> brings much earth into the <HI>Khalis.</HI></NOTE> they make it even and &s;mooth from end to end, carrying away the Earth they take out upon A&s;&s;es-backs into the Fields. If they did not do &s;o, in three or four Years time the <HI>Khalis</HI> would be &s;o choaked up, by the abundance of new Earth that is brought into it by the Water of the <HI>Nile,</HI> that all the Hou&s;es would be laid under Water.</P>

The di&s;hes are all of Rice, Broths, and the like, Green, Red, Yellow, and of &s;everal Colours; they have al&s;o good Joynts of Roa&s;t-meat, but without any Sauce; however they make &s;ome Ragoes of the Nuts of Pine-Apples, Almonds, and &s;uch other things, they mind not the dainti|ne&s;s and variety, but only the quantity of Victuals, and that they be not &s;poil'd.

none, becau&s;e the <HI>Beys</HI> Gentleman of the Hor&s;e, promi&s;ed us the u&s;e of his to <HI>Suez.</HI></P>
<P>Having made ready our Provi&s;ions, we loaded them on a Camel, and then I parted from <HI>Caire</HI> on <HI>Thur&s;day,</HI> the &s;eventeenth of <HI>January,</HI> in the Year 1658. with a <HI>Capucine,</HI> and a French man of <HI>Provence,</HI> who under&s;tood <HI>Arabick</HI> very well; and a <HI>Moor</HI> Servant who u&s;ed to &s;erve the French, and could &s;peak a little <HI>Lingua Franca,</HI> having left my own Man, who was indi&s;po&s;ed, at <HI>Caire.</HI> We went from <HI>Caire</HI> to the <HI>Birque,</HI> which is but four leagues di&s;tant, and encamped there, waiting for the re&s;t of the Caravan, that con&s;i&s;ted of two thou&s;and Camels loaded with Timber, for building a Ship for the <HI>Grand Signior; Novali Bey</HI> had orders to get her built, and was gone a little before. The <HI>Bey</HI> of <HI>Suez</HI> went along with this Caravan in a Litter carried by two Camels; he made the Journey, becau&s;e one of his Galleys was arrived; and that was the cau&s;e al&s;o of the <HI>Capucins</HI> going, that he might Confe&s;s the Slaves on board. This <HI>Birque</HI> is &s;pacious, and has always water in it; there are &s;ome who pay &s;o much a year to the <HI>Grand Signior,</HI> for liberty to catch Wild-duck and Fi&s;h in it. <HI>Friday</HI> all day long the re&s;t of the Caravan was a coming, and <HI>Saturday</HI> Morning a Man cried aloud, that all &s;hould make ready to depart at Noon; for it is the cu&s;tome in Caravans that are any thing big, to give notice of parting &s;ome hours before; but towards Noon there fell &s;o great a Tempe&s;t,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Tempe&s;t in the De&s;art.</NOTE> (for in Sandy De&s;arts there are Tempe&s;ts, a&s;wel as at Sea) that we could not &s;et out that day. It blew &s;o furiou&s;ly, that I thought all the Tents would have been carried away by the Wind, which drove before it &s;uch clouds of Sand, that we were almo&s;t buried under it; for &s;eeing no body could &s;tay abroad, without having mouth and eyes immediately filled with Sand, we lay under the Tent, where the Wind drove in the Sand above a foot deep round about us: We had two Pa&s;ties not as yet opened, and they were wrapt up in napkins at the bottom of a Maund, well covered with a napkin &s;ewed over it. When the Storm was over, which la&s;ted not above three or four hours, we opened our Pa&s;ties, but found them &s;o full of &s;and, that no body could eat of them (&s;o &s;ubtile and penetrating the &s;and is) &s;o that we were forced to throw them away; and the&s;e are the occa&s;ions, when one finds the advantage of a good Tent.</P>
<P>Next day, the twentieth of <HI>January,</HI> we parted at eleven a clock in the Morning, and at three in the Afternoon re&s;ted, that we might drink Coffee; then half an hour after, the Timbrels &s;ounding, we marched on till one a clock next morning;<NOTE PLACE="marg">The march of the Cara|vans.</NOTE> for in the Caravans there is commonly a Man mounted on a Camel, who now and then beats two Timbrels or Kettle-drums that are on each &s;ide of the Camel before him; the Ca&s;es of the&s;e Timbrels are of bra&s;s, and they &s;erve not only to chear up the Camels (who delight much in &s;uch a noi&s;e, and in &s;inging) but al&s;o to give warning to tho&s;e that &s;tay behind.</P>
<P><HI>Monday</HI> afternoon we parted, and having re&s;ted a little about five a clock, half an hour, we &s;et forward again, and marched on till four of the clock in <HI>Tue&s;day</HI> morning, travelling always a good league an hour: About half an hours march beyond the place where we had re&s;ted, we &s;aw a very hand&s;ome Turki&s;h Sepulchre, where the <HI>Kiaya</HI> of a Caravan lies buried, who coming from <HI>Suez,</HI> was &s;et upon by many <HI>Arabs:</HI> The <HI>Kiaya</HI> having for a long time fought with the <HI>Arabs</HI> in defence of the Caravan, as his office obliged him, (for the <HI>Kiaya</HI> of the Caravan is the Lieutenant of the Governour of <HI>Suez,</HI> and is obliged to guard all the Caravans that come or go from <HI>Caire</HI> to <HI>Suez;</HI>) this <HI>Kiaya</HI> (I &s;ay) after a long fight, received a thru&s;t with a Pike in the Belly, of which he pre&s;ently died, and was interred in the &s;ame place. Since that time, the Ve&s;&s;els on the Red-Sea pay five thou&s;and Pia&s;tres at <HI>Suez</HI> to maintain an hundred Soldiers, whereof fifty are to abide in a Ca&s;tle near to <HI>Suez,</HI> to guard the Countrey; and the other fifty with the <HI>Kiaya,</HI> wait upon the Caravans. An hours journey beyond that Sepulchre, we found a great long Ci&s;tern, built of fair Free-&s;tone, which is filled by Rain-water.

<P>All our Provi&s;ions being then in a readine&s;s,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Journey to <HI>Tor.</HI></NOTE> every one mounted his Camel as if we had been takeing Hor&s;e, and parted from <HI>Suez</HI> on <HI>Friday</HI> the five and twentieth of <HI>January,</HI> about four of the Clock after noon, keeping along the &s;ide of the <HI>Red-&s;ea</HI> till we came to the end of it, where we cro&s;&s;ed over dry to the other &s;ide; there we &s;aw a Bear about an hundred paces from us, but &s;o &s;oon as it perceived us, it took the Water and &s;wam over to the other &s;ide, &s;o that we &s;oon lo&s;t &s;ight of it; we found many more of them afterwards on our Journey. We travelled till eight a Clock at night, and then re&s;ted in a place where there was &s;ome Broom; for they never brought us to re&s;t any where but in Places where they could find &s;ome fewel, not only to warm them, but for boyling their Coffee and Mafrouca. This was the fir&s;t time that ever I rode upon a Camel, and indeed, it made me very weary, for their Pack-&s;addles are &s;o broad that they are very unea&s;ie to ones Legs, which mu&s;t &s;traddle very wide; the fatigue of this la&s;ted with me about two days, but after that, I grew accu&s;tomed to it. Camels are &s;o well known at pre&s;ent,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Camels.</NOTE> that I think it would be &s;uper|fluous to give a de&s;cription of them. I &s;hall only &s;ay that there are two kinds of them, to wit, tho&s;e which are called Camels, and tho&s;e whom they name Dromedaries; at lea&s;t I think they may be ranked under one kind;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dromedaries.</NOTE> for all the difference that is betwixt them is, that the Camels have one bunch of fle&s;h upon their Backs, are great and high, go con&s;tantly at one pace, which is fa&s;t, but hard, and travel (when they are loaded with &s;even or eight

hundred weight) about thirty good leagues a day. The Dromedaries have two bunches of fle&s;h on their back, &s;haped naturally like a Saddle, are le&s;s, &s;maller and lighter than the Camels, and are only for carrying of men; they have a good &s;oft trott, and will travel with ea&s;e forty Leagues a day; all that one has to do, is to &s;it them well, and indeed, there are &s;ome that tye them&s;elves to them, for fear of falling; in all things el&s;e they are like Camels, they have Ears and a &s;hort Tail like them, a cloven foot, and as &s;oft as a Spunge, the neck long, and hair ju&s;t like a Camels, both kneel when they are loaded and unloaded, and then ri&s;e as they are bid; their Food is the &s;ame, and both endure thir&s;t well, continuing upon occa&s;ion five days without drinking however the Camels can ab&s;tain longer than the Drome|daries.</P>
<P>But to return to our Journey, we parted from our fir&s;t Stage <HI>Saturday</HI> the twenty &s;ixth of <HI>January</HI> about five a Clock in the morning, and during all this Journey,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ain el Mou&s;e.</NOTE> it was very cold in the mornings, until the &s;un was up. Shortly after we found &s;everal waters, which they call <HI>Ain el Mou&s;e,</HI> that is to &s;ay, the Wells of <HI>Mo&s;es;</HI> there we filled our Borrachios, as we did where ever we found fre&s;h water. About half an hour after ten, we re&s;ted, and having baited, we went forwards about eleven, and travelled till &s;ix a Clock at night, having the <HI>Red-Sea</HI> always on our right hand, about half a league wide of us.

<P><HI>Sunday January</HI> the twenty &s;eventh, we &s;et out about five a clock in the morning, and had not advanced above five hundred paces, when pa&s;&s;ing by the &s;ide of a Bu&s;h,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An <HI>Arab</HI> who who had not eaten in five days time.</NOTE> we heard a Voice that called to us, and being come to the place we found a poor langui&s;hing <HI>Arab,</HI> who told us that he had not eaten a bit for five days; we gave him &s;ome Victuals and Drink with a provi|&s;ion of Bread for two days more, and &s;o went on our way. We were not afraid of the <HI>Arabs,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Meeting with <HI>Arabs</HI> in the De&s;art.</NOTE> (whom we met on the way) for when we found any, they civilly &s;aluted us, and departed after we had given them &s;ome Bread and Tobacco, which they very courteou&s;ly de&s;ired of us, for they dur&s;t not do us any hurt, &s;eeing us guarded by two <HI>Scheiks,</HI> who told them that they had an|&s;wered for us: when we re&s;ted in any place to feed, &s;ome of them came often, who having &s;aluted us, fell a eating with our <HI>Arabs,</HI> and when none came, one of our <HI>Arabs</HI> cried out (as loud as po&s;&s;ibly he could) <HI>That if any body had a mind to eat they might &s;afely come,</HI> and made this proclamation on all &s;ides, &s;o that &s;uch as heard the invitation, failed not to come with their half-pikes, and laying down their Arms, fell a feeding together on the <HI>Ma|frouca,</HI> (of which I &s;hall &s;peak hereafter:) but there was no nece&s;&s;ity of mak|ing proclamation at night, for &s;o &s;oon as they &s;aw the fire we made, they came immediately to &s;ee what it meant.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Tor.</NOTE><HI>TOR</HI> is no con&s;iderable place, neverthele&s;s it has a good harbour for Ships and Galleys. This Port is guarded by a little &s;quare Ca&s;tle on the Sea-&s;ide, with a Tower at each corner and two &s;mall Guns on the out-&s;ide before the Gate: an <HI>Aga</HI> is Governour of this Ca&s;tle where none but Turks lodge: Near to it there is a Convent of Greeks dedicated to St. <HI>Catherine</HI> and to the Apparition of God to <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> in the Burning-Bu&s;h. We delivered the <HI>Aga</HI> the Letter from the Bey of <HI>Suez,</HI> but becau&s;e we had no pre&s;ent for him, he made no great account of us. We lodged in the Convent, which is very fair and &s;pacious; there we were very well received, entertained with the Be&s;t, and ate Fi&s;h of the <HI>Red-Sea;</HI> at that time there were thirty Monks in it. We &s;earched for Provi&s;ions there, but could not find any; only the Monks commi&s;erating our condition, gave us Olives, Dates, Onions, and a Jar of Brandy, which we husbanded as well as we could: we &s;tayed a day there becau&s;e the Monks told us that we needed two Septiers more of Flower; &s;o that having bought the Corn and got it ground, they baked Bread of one half of it, to give our <HI>Arabs</HI> by the way and upon the Mount, and all this they did in a very obliging manner. While we were there, we bought of the&s;e poor Greeks &s;everal &s;tone-Mu&s;hromes, which in that place are got out of the <HI>Red-Sea;</HI> as al&s;o &s;mall Stone-&s;hrubs, or branches of Rock, which they call white Coral, and many great &s;hells, all taken out of the Sea, and very plea|&s;ant for artificial works: But they could not furni&s;h me with any thing of a certain Fi&s;h,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>A</HI> Sea-man.</NOTE> which they call a Sea-man; however I got the hand of one &s;ince. This Fi&s;h is taken in the <HI>Red-Sea,</HI> about little I&s;les, that are clo&s;e by <HI>Tor.</HI> It is a great &s;trong Fi&s;h and hath nothing extraordinary but two hands, which are indeed, like the hands of a man, &s;aving that the Fingers are joined together with a skin like the foot of a Goo&s;e, but the skin of the Fi&s;h is like the skin of a wild Goat, or <HI>Shamois.</HI> When they &s;pie that Fi&s;h, they &s;trike him on the back with Harping-Irons, as they do Whales, and &s;o kill him: They u&s;e the skin of it for making Bucklers, which are Mu&s;quet proof.</P>
<P>Having payed all and made a Pre&s;ent of &s;ome Pia&s;tres to the Monks, for their kind reception, we prepared to be gone, but were obliged fir&s;t to pay a due of twenty eight Maidins a head, to wit, four for <HI>Tor,</HI> and twenty four for the Mount, and all to the u&s;e of the <HI>Arabs.</HI></P>
<P>We parted from <HI>Tor</HI> on <HI>Thur&s;day</HI> the la&s;t of <HI>January,</HI> about eleven a clock in the Fore-noon, with a Monk whom they &s;ent with us, to &s;hew us the chief Places of the Mount, and we payed for a Camel to carry him thither and back again. He &s;poke to us Turki&s;h and <HI>Arabick,</HI> for he under&s;tood not a word of <HI>Lingua Franca.</HI> we &s;aw on our way the Garden of the Monks of <HI>Tor,</HI> which is not far from it; this Garden is the place which in Holy Scrip|ture is called <HI>Elim,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Elim.</NOTE> where when the <HI>I&s;raelites</HI> went that way there were only &s;eventy Palm-Trees, and twelve wells of bitter water, which <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> made &s;weet, by ca&s;ting a piece of Wood into them: the&s;e Wells are &s;till in being, being near one another, and mo&s;t of them within the precincts of the Garden; the re&s;t are pretty near, they are all hot, and are returned again to their fir&s;t bitterne&s;s, for I ta&s;ted of one of them where People Bath them&s;elves,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hamam Mou&s;a</NOTE> which by the <HI>Arabs</HI> is called <HI>Hamam Mou&s;a,</HI> that is to &s;ay, the Bath of <HI>Mo&s;es;</HI> it is in a little dark Cave. there is nothing in that Garden, but abundance of Palm-Trees, which yield &s;ome rent to the Monks, but the &s;eventy old Palm-Trees are not there now. After we had &s;een the&s;e things, we filled our Borrachios with the water of a Well near to that place, which

belongs to the Monks; I told them that it &s;tunk a little, and they made an&s;wer that they had not Scowered it that year as they u&s;ed every year to do, but withall, that it was the be&s;t water thereabouts. Heretofore they had a Church near to that Well, which the Turks Demoli&s;hed, and with the &s;tones of it built the afore&s;aid Ca&s;tle called <HI>Tor.</HI> We travelled in the Plain till &s;ix a clock at night and then re&s;ted.

The <HI>Arabs</HI> gather the Gum in Autumn, without pricking the Trees, for it runs of it &s;elf, and then they &s;ell it in the Town.</P>
<P>Next day, <HI>Friday</HI> the fir&s;t of <HI>February,</HI> we &s;et out about five a Clock in the Morning, and entred among high Mountains, where we re&s;ted near a Brook, and putting on again about eleven a clock, we travelled till about half an hour after four, that we came into a little Plain, where finding &s;ome Cottages of <HI>Arabs,</HI> our Guides would go no farther that day,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cottages of <HI>Arabs.</HI></NOTE> but fea&s;ted merrily on the Milk that we bought for them in the&s;e Cottages.

<P>We parted from thence <HI>Saturday</HI> the &s;econd of <HI>February,</HI> about two a clock in the Morning, and travelled a Foot over other Hills, where the way was very bad; about eight a Clock in the morning we found little Hou&s;es pretty well built; where <HI>Arabs</HI> live at pre&s;ent.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Raphidim.</NOTE> This place is called <HI>Raphi|dim</HI> in holy Scripture.

We were near three Hours in getting up that Mountain, we &s;topt (indeed) &s;eve|ral times by the way to drink Water; but be&s;ides, the Hill is full of &s;harp cutting Stones, and many &s;teep and &s;lippery places to be climb'd up, that hinder People from going fa&s;t. There are many Stones to be found in a&s;cending this Hill, on which Trees are naturally repre&s;ented, that being broken retain the &s;ame Figure within; of which Stones, &s;ome are prodigiou&s;ly big. About the middle of the Mountain there is a lovely Spring of clear Water, with a great Ba&s;on in the Rock. This Spring was di&s;covered by a Quail, when the Monks having brought down the Body of St. <HI>Catharine</HI> &s;o far, were ready to die for Heat and Thir&s;t, and that Spring began at that time to run. This water was &s;o hard frozen in the Ba&s;on, that we could not break the Ice with good blows of a Stick. In many places of the Mountain, we &s;aw al&s;o a great deal of Snow, and at length, got up to the top of it, where there is a Dome, under which is the place whither the Body of St. <HI>Catharine</HI> was brought by Angels, immediately after &s;he was Beheaded in <HI>Alexandria;</HI> that holy Body remained Three hundred Years there, until a good Monk, having had in the Night-time a Revelation, that the Body was in the top of the Hill, went next Morning with all the Religious, who in Proce&s;&s;ion brought it down to the Mona&s;tery, where it was put in a lovely Silver Shrine, that is &s;till there. Under the Dome where this Body lay, there is a great piece of Rock ri&s;ing a little out of the Ground, whereon (they &s;ay) the Angels placed it, and it bears &s;till the marks, as if a Body had been laid on the Back upon it, for the form of the Reins appear there. The <HI>Greeks</HI> hold that this Cave was made by Miracle, but there is &s;ome likelihood that it hath been done by the Hands of Men: They made this little Dome about the Rock, in form of a &s;quare Chap|pel. Having in this place paid our Devotions, we came down again with a great deal of trouble, and were two long hours by the way; &s;o that we were tired enough, when we arrived at the Mona&s;tery of the Forty Martyrs at &s;ix a clock at night.</P>

From this place one may ea&s;ily &s;ee down into the Convent, which is at the foot of the Mount, and as it were ju&s;t under tho&s;e who are on the top of it. There you &s;ee a fair large Church covered with Lead, where (they &s;ay) the Body of St. <HI>Catherine</HI> is in pieces. Before the door of the &s;aid Church, within the Precincts of the Mona&s;tery, there is beautiful Mo&s;que. As we were coming down again, we found by the way a great Stone, and (as the <HI>Greeks</HI> &s;ay) this is the place to which the Pro|phet <HI>Elias</HI> came, having fled from Mount <HI>Carmel,</HI> becau&s;e of the Per&s;ecution of <HI>Jezabel,</HI> Queen of <HI>Syria;</HI> being come to that place where the Stone is, an Angel appeared unto him, and with a Rod, &s;miting that great Stone, made it fall down in the way, and forbid <HI>Elias</HI> to go any farther, telling him, that &s;ince <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> had not been in the Holy Land, he &s;hould not go to the top of this Mount. A little lower, is the Foot of a Camel, &s;o well imprinted on the Rock, that it cannot be better &s;tamped upon the Sand over which a Camel pa&s;&s;es; the <HI>Moors</HI> and <HI>Arabs</HI> &s;ay it is the print of the Foot of <HI>Mahomet</HI>'s Camel, which it left there as he pa&s;&s;ed that way upon it, they ki&s;s it with great devotion; but it is credible that the <HI>Greeks</HI> have made it to captivate their friend&s;hip, to the end they may reverence tho&s;e places. After that, in &s;everal places of the Mount, we &s;aw little Chappels, which have all little Hou&s;es near them, and Gardens full of Fruit-Trees. Heretofore the&s;e places were inhabited by Her|mites, in &s;o great number, that it is &s;aid, that in the Mountain of <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> there were in ancient Times above fourteen thou&s;and Hermites; afterwards the Greeks kept Monks in all the&s;e Hermitages, to celebrate Divine Office; but at pre&s;ent there are none, becau&s;e the <HI>Arabs</HI> too much tormented them. We dined upon this Mountain on Bread, Onions, and Dates that we had brought with us, and then went to &s;ee the Hermitages, and fir&s;t we found three of the&s;e Chappels altogether, with a pa&s;&s;age from one to another: Behind the Altar of the third, which is dedicated to the Honour of St. <HI>Elias,</HI> there is a Hole in the Rock, where <HI>Elias</HI> lived all the while that he &s;ojourned in that Mount, becau&s;e of the Per&s;ecution of <HI>Jezabel.</HI> Then we came to another place where there are three Chappels more, dedicated one to the Honour of the Ble&s;|&s;ed <HI>Virgin,</HI> another to the Honour of St. <HI>Ann,</HI> and a third to the Honour of St. <HI>John;</HI> after that, to a Chappel dedicated to St. <HI>Pantaleon,</HI> then to another dedicated to the Holy <HI>Virgin,</HI> another to <HI>David,</HI> another to the Bapti&s;m of our Lord <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> another to St. <HI>Anthony</HI> the Hermite; to another place where there are three little Cells, in which (the Greeks &s;ay) that two Elder Sons of the Greek Emperour &s;hut them&s;elves up, each in his Cell, cau&s;ing the Doors to be walled up, and leaving only a Window in each, &s;till to be &s;een, by which they received Victuals from a Servant who lived in the third Cell, that was not &s;hut up, and that both of them died in their &s;everal Cells. All the&s;e Chappels are &s;cattered up and down upon the Mount, &s;o that one mu&s;t go a good way before he can vi&s;ite them all: Near to every one of them, there is a little Hou&s;e, a Garden, and good Water. From thence we went down to the great Mona|&s;tery at the foot of the Mountain, by &s;teps whith heretofore reached from the &s;aid Mona&s;tery up to the top of the Mount, and were in number fourteen thou|&s;and; at pre&s;ent &s;ome of them are broken; tho&s;e that remain, are well made, and ea&s;ie to go up or down.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The height of the Moun|tain of <HI>Mo&s;es.</HI></NOTE> One may judge of the height of St. <HI>Catherine</HI>'s Mount, by this, which certainly is not &s;o high by a third, and yet hath fourteen thou&s;and Steps up to it. Upon the way as we came down, we found two fair &s;tone Porticos, by which we pa&s;&s;ed, and where (the Greeks &s;ay) that they who performed the Pilgrimage, paid heretofore a certain &s;mall due. After that, we came to the great Mona&s;tery at the bottom, which is welt built of good Free-&s;tone, with very high &s;mooth Walls; on the Ea&s;t-&s;ide there is a Window,

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Mona&s;te|ry of St. <HI>Ca|therine.</HI></NOTE>FOR the&s;e thou&s;and years, the Greeks have been in Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of this Mona|&s;tery, which was given them by a Greek Emperour, called <HI>Ju&s;tinian;</HI> and they afterwards living there, on a certain day, <HI>Mahomet,</HI> who (as the Greeks &s;ay) was their Camel Driver, weary after the toyl of bringing in Provi&s;ions upon the Camels, fell a &s;leep before the Gate of the Mona&s;tery; while he was a &s;leep, there came an Eagle and hovered for a long time over his Head,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An Eagle o|ver <HI>Mahomet</HI>'s Head.</NOTE> which the Por|ter of the Mona&s;tery ob&s;erving, ran in great amazement to acquaint the Abbot with it, who immediately coming, &s;aw the &s;ame thing, and reflecting there|upon, as &s;oon as <HI>Mahomet</HI> awoke, asked him, whether or not, if being a Great and Mighty Lord, he would be kind to them? <HI>Mahomet</HI> made an&s;wer, that he neither was, nor ever like to be &s;uch; but the other &s;till in&s;i&s;ting upon that Suppo&s;ition, <HI>Mahomet</HI> told him, that he ought not at all to doubt of it, but that if it were in his power, he would do them all the good he could, becau&s;e he had his livelihood from them;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Mahomet</HI>'s Promi&s;e.</NOTE> the Abbot would needs have that Promi&s;e from him in writing, but <HI>Mahomet</HI> affirming that he could not write, the Abbot &s;ent for an Ink-horn,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Mahomet</HI> could not write.</NOTE> and <HI>Mahomet</HI> having wet his Hand in the Ink, clapt it upon a leaf of clean Paper, and made thereon the impre&s;&s;ion of his Hand, which he gave them as a confirmation of what he &s;aid. Having &s;ometime after attained to that Grandeur which was pre&s;aged to him by the Eagle, he called to mind his Promi&s;e, and pre&s;erved to them their Mona&s;tery, with all the Land belong|ing to it, but upon condition, that they &s;hould give Victuals to all the <HI>Arabs</HI> of the neighbourhood. And for that rea&s;on, when there are any Monks in the Mona&s;tery, they are obliged to give Half a Peck of Corn to every <HI>Arab</HI> that comes, and the&s;e <HI>Arabs</HI> grind it in a little Mill that they carry always about with them, who come &s;ometimes to the number of an hundred and fifty, two hundred, nay, four hundred in a day, and mu&s;t all be &s;erved; &s;o that it amounts &s;ometimes to many Quarters of Corn, and to &s;ome they give three or four <HI>Pia&s;tres</HI> a year, more or le&s;s, according as they de&s;erve it. Now about two years before I was there, Provi&s;ions coming to the Mona&s;tery, the <HI>Arabs</HI> robb'd them; which made the Greeks for&s;ake the Convent, the Gate whereof is walled up, and the Walls &s;o high, that they cannot be &s;caled, and without Cannon, that place cannot be taken, if there were any within to defend it: But now for two years there has no body lived in it, becau&s;e they would puni&s;h the <HI>Arabs,</HI> by depriving them of the &s;u&s;tenance which they daily had of them, till they can bring them to rea&s;on; and therefore it was that we found &s;o many Monks in that Mona&s;tery of <HI>Tor,</HI> whither they were almo&s;t all retired, for there are not &s;o many there, when the Convent of Mount <HI>Sinai</HI> is open. The&s;e Monks had many Rents in <HI>Candy,</HI> which they lo&s;t by the Inva&s;ion of the Turks. They have a Bi&s;hop, who is called the Bi&s;hop of Mount <HI>Sinai,</HI> on whom depend all the&s;e Convents and Chappels, even the Convent of <HI>Tor</HI> too; and this Bi&s;hop depends not on the Patriarch, he was at that time at <HI>Caire.</HI> We were fain to re&s;t &s;atisfied then, with what we &s;aw of that Mona&s;tery from the top of the Mount.</P>

<P>AFter we had walked round that Mona&s;tery, we returned,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mount <HI>Horeb.</HI></NOTE> and &s;aw at &s;ome &s;mall di&s;tance, Mount <HI>Horeb,</HI> on which <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> fed his Flocks, when he &s;aw the Burning Bu&s;h. And near to that, are the Mountains upon which <HI>Aaron</HI> prayed for the People, all little ones. There is a fair Garden adjoyning to the Mona&s;tery, and within the Walls of it, a lovely Chappel, dedicated to the Holy <HI>Virgin.</HI> Upon our return from the Mona&s;tery of the Forty Martyrs, about half a quarter of a league from the &s;aid Garden, we &s;aw the Stone, or rather Place where the Golden Calf was molten; it is in the very Rock,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The place where the Golden Calf was molten.</NOTE> where one may &s;ee a great Head of a Calf cut to the life, and within that place it was (as the Greeks &s;ay) that the Riches and Ornaments of the <HI>I&s;raelites</HI> were ca&s;t, of which they made the Head of the Golden Calf that they wor&s;hipped while <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> was with God upon the Mountain: But it is more probable that the Greeks have in that place cut the Head of the Calf in the Rock, to &s;hew the place where it was Ca&s;t, or where it was placed upon a Pillar. Something near to that, there is a high and great Stone, with &s;ome In&s;cription upon it, but &s;o defaced, that none of it can be read. The Greeks &s;ay that this Stone was to mark the place where <HI>Jeremiah</HI> hid the Ve&s;&s;els of Gold and Silver, and other co&s;tly Furniture of the Temple of <HI>Salomon,</HI> when the <HI>I&s;raelites</HI> were carried away Captives to <HI>Babylon,</HI> and that it is not known how it hath been brought thither, but that there is a very ancient Authour that &s;peaks of it, as being on Mount <HI>Sinai.</HI> Father <HI>Kercher</HI> explains it in his <HI>Prodromus Copticus,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Father <HI>Ker|cher.</HI></NOTE> where he forges an Explanation of the&s;e Characters, which are unknown to all Men be&s;ides him&s;elf, as if they were Hieroglyphicks, whereof without doubt he hath had the meaning by Revelation.

and then having travelled about an hour, and one half of it up hill, we went down into a very low place, where there is a little Habitation, with &s;everal Gardens full of Fruit-trees, and a large Spring of excellent Water.

<P>About eleven of the clock, we came to a place where our Camels &s;tay'd for us, and having dined, and given &s;ome Pia&s;tres to the Monk who had &s;hew'd us every thing, for his pains, we &s;et out about noon, and followed the &s;ame way we came till four of the clock in the afternoon, that we left it and &s;truck off to the right, leaving the Red-Sea at a pretty good di&s;tance from us on our left hand. We travelled in good way, being the &s;treighte&s;t, plea|&s;ante&s;t and &s;horte&s;t Road from Mount <HI>Sinai</HI> to <HI>Suez:</HI> But as we went, we took the way by <HI>Tor,</HI> partly to &s;ee it, and partly to take a Monk to guide us in our vi&s;itations.

<P>Next morning, <HI>Tue&s;day</HI> the Fifth of <HI>February,</HI> we &s;et out at four of the clock, keeping &s;till in good way, and re&s;ted about ten of the clock in a place where there was Water.

<P>Next day, <HI>Wedne&s;day</HI> the &s;ixth of <HI>February,</HI> we parted at five a clock in the morning, and about eight, &s;ome two or three hundred paces wide of the Road, we found a Well of good water, where we provided our&s;elves.

<P>Next day, <HI>Thur&s;day</HI> the &s;eventh of <HI>February,</HI> we parted about five of the clock in the morning, about &s;ix we entered again into the way by which we came, and found a Caravan of about two hundred Camels belonging to <HI>Arabs,</HI> loaded with Coal, and going to <HI>Caire:</HI> When they have gathered their Gums, they carry them in this manner in Caravans to the City.

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. XXXII.</HI> Of the <HI>Arabs.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE <HI>Arabs</HI> are of the Race of <HI>I&s;hmael,</HI> and of his Twelve Sons, who were the Patriarchs of the Tribes of the <HI>Arabs,</HI> as the Twelve Sons of <HI>Jacob,</HI> were Heads of the twelve Tribes of <HI>I&s;rael.</HI> The&s;e <HI>Arabs</HI> are divided into tho&s;e who live in Towns, and tho&s;e who inhabit the De&s;arts; the&s;e la&s;t are the <HI>Arabs</HI> whom the Ancients called <HI>Scenitae,</HI> and are now adays called <HI>Bedouins,</HI> of whom particularly I intend to Treat. One good quality they have, that they willingly rob Caravans when they can, and do no other hurt, but &s;trip Travellers &s;tark naked, unle&s;s they make re&s;i&s;tance; but when they catch any Turks, they give them not &s;o good quarter, e&s;pecially if any of their Coun|trymen have been lately u&s;ed &s;everely in the Towns. The&s;e People who are very numerous, live in the De&s;arts, where (though they lead a mo&s;t wretched life) yet they think them&s;elves mo&s;t happy. Their Cloathing is a long blew Shirt, &s;ewed up on both &s;ides from top to bottom, and then with a great piece of white Searge, they wrap them&s;elves about the Body, under the Arm-pits, and over the Shoulders, giving it &s;everal turns about them; &s;ome of them al&s;o have Drawers, and a kind of Furred Ve&s;t, or el&s;e a great many Sheeps Skins &s;ewed together, putting the rough &s;ide towards their Shirt to keep them warm, and turning it the contrary way again, when they would be cooler: Several wear al&s;o a kind of <HI>Pabouches,</HI> which are almo&s;t like our Shoes. Their Wives are al&s;o mi&s;erably ill Cloathed, all cover their Faces with a Linnen-cloath with holes in it for their Eyes, and wear great Rings of Lattin in their Ears. Mo&s;t of the&s;e People have flocks of Camels, Sheep, and Goats, which they feed here and there, according as they find Gra&s;s; and where they find Pa|&s;ture, they pitch their ugly Tents made of Goats-hair, in which their Wives and Children live; but when that is eaten up, they pack up Bag and Baggage, and loading their Camels with all they have, Hou&s;e, Goods, Wives and Chil|dren, they go in &s;earch of Pa&s;ture &s;omewhere el&s;e. They live on Camels or Goats Milk, and on the fle&s;h of Camels, with water for their Drink; they al&s;o eat Cakes or Buns, among others they have the <HI>Mafrouca,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Mafrouca.</NOTE> which is a great regale to them; and indeed, they eat but &s;eldom of that, I have &s;een them many times make it on our Journey to Mount <HI>Sinai,</HI> where they had it daily, Morning and Evening at my co&s;t, for I grudged them nothing. They mingle Flower with Water in a Wooden-Bowl, which they carry always about with them, and knead it well into a Pa&s;te, then they &s;pread it upon the Sand, ma|king it round, very thin, and a Foot and a half in Diametre, after that they lay it upon the Sand where the Fire was made, covering it up with hot Embers; and live Coals over them, and when it is baked on one &s;ide, they turn it upon the other: When it is well baked, they break it into &s;mall pieces, and with a little Water knead it again of new, adding thereto Butter, and &s;ometimes al&s;o Honey; they make it into a thick Pa&s;te, and then break it into great pieces, which they work and pre&s;s betwixt their Fingers, and &s;o feed on them with delight; and they look like tho&s;e Gobbets of Pa&s;te that are given to Gee&s;e to fatten them. Their De&s;arts are divided into Tribes, and the Tribes into Families, which po&s;&s;e&s;s different Quarters. Each Tribe hath a <HI>Scheik el Kebir,</HI> or great <HI>Scheik,</HI> and every Family hath its <HI>Scheik,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Scheik el Kebir.</NOTE> or Cap|tain. The <HI>Scheik el Kebir</HI> commands all the other <HI>Scheiks,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Scheiks</HI> of the <HI>Arabs.</HI></NOTE> and the&s;e <HI>Scheiks</HI> admini&s;ter Ju&s;tice to the <HI>Arabs,</HI> having power over them of Life and Death, and are punctually obeyed in what they Command, for they can Fine tho&s;e in Money who are refractory; the Offices of <HI>Scheiks</HI> are Hereditary, de&s;cending from Father to Son, and when the <HI>Scheik</HI> of Family dies without Children, all the Family a&s;&s;emble together; and having &s;et forth the prai&s;es of tho&s;e whom they think worthy of the Charge, they chu&s;e the mo&s;t vertuous, and
<PB N="174" REF="107">
entreat the <HI>Scheik el Kebir</HI> to approve of their Election. It is the &s;ame thing in the Election of the <HI>Scheik el Kebir,</HI> only it is made in an A&s;&s;embly of the whole Tribe. The Ba&s;has commonly give &s;ome pay to the <HI>Scheik el Kebir</HI> of the Tribes that are &s;cattered in their Governments, being very unwilling to have any quarrel with them; and the Caravans al&s;o allow him a &s;um of Mo|ney yearly, that they may &s;afely pa&s;s without Mole&s;tation; to the other <HI>Scheiks</HI> they give Provi&s;ions, Money, Ve&s;ts, and Cloth for Shirts, in certain proportions, and the&s;e Blades think them&s;elves in their Tents happier than Kings. <HI>Sultan Amurat</HI> heretofore would have confined them to live in Towns exempted from all Payments, but they would not hear of it. They keep con&s;tantly Spies abroad on all hands, to know if there be any Plots in hand again&s;t them, and to be always ready to defend them&s;elves, or flie farther off; and certainly there is no great hurt to be done unto them in tho&s;e De&s;arts, for &s;eeing there are no High-ways in them, an Enemy would &s;oon lo&s;e them&s;elves. Be&s;ides that, they mu&s;t carry with them Provi&s;ions for all the time they mu&s;t be there, for nothing is to be found in tho&s;e places, nay, they would &s;oon die of thir&s;t too; for though there be &s;everal Wells on all hands, yet none but the <HI>Arabs</HI> know where they are. The Arms of the <HI>Arabs</HI> are Lances, or Half-pikes, Swords or Sha|bles, and long Daggers; Fire-arms they have none, but are much afraid of them, and it is prohibited to &s;ell them any, though indeed, they know not at all how to u&s;e them. For I know a French Merchant, who one time meeting with <HI>Arabs,</HI> they &s;tript him &s;tark naked, and before they left him, made him &s;hoot off his Fire-lock and Pi&s;tols, which they &s;uffered him to keep. They have al&s;o Bucklers, made of the Skin of a Fi&s;h, called the <HI>Sea-man.</HI> They have pretty Hor&s;es,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Arabian Hor&s;es.</NOTE> that are &s;mall, but indefatigable, and run &s;o fa&s;t that they &s;eem to flie; where they alight, they leave them without making them fa&s;t to any thing, and the&s;e Hor&s;es &s;tir not from the place where they have been left.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The food of the Arabian Hor&s;es.</NOTE> And indeed, when they find them for their purpo&s;e, they are careful to feed them with Camels Milk, Butter, Camels fle&s;h dried in the Sun, and Wheat, all which things make them very &s;trong. Tho&s;e who have any competent E&s;tate, keep a Camel to &s;ave their Life in time of danger. They feed him from a Colt with Camels Milk, Butter, Camels fle&s;h dried in the Sun, and Wheat, and give him nothing el&s;e to eat, which makes them very &s;trong and &s;wift, as well as their Hor&s;es. The <HI>Arabs</HI> of different Tribes, are many times in Wars one with another, and the <HI>Scheik el Kebir</HI> marches at the head of them. When one of them kills another in time of peace, if the Friends apprehend the Malefactor, they carry him before the <HI>Scheik el Kebir,</HI> who condemns him to death, or to pay &s;o much to the Relations of the decea&s;ed, according as they de&s;ire it; but commonly tho&s;e of the &s;ame Family, revenge the death of their Relation, and they are &s;o ob&s;tinate in their revenge, that they'll keep it an Hundred Years; the Mother ever now and then &s;hewing her Children the Bloody Shirt of their Father.

<P>They told me a great many things more of their Cu&s;toms, as among others, If an <HI>Arab</HI> marry a Maid, he kills a Camel or two, according as he is able to make a Fea&s;t, and gives &s;o much to the Maid: If at any time after, a near Re|lation of the Maids (who was ab&s;ent when the Wedding was made) happen to come, and be di&s;plea&s;ed with the Marriage, he pays back the Husband what Money he gave to his Kin&s;woman, the Camel which he killed, and breaks the Marriage, though the Maid be deflowred. Though the&s;e People be <HI>Mu&s;ul|mans,</HI> yet they make no other Prayers, than now and then to &s;ay <HI>Bi&s;millah,</HI> that is to &s;ay, in the Name of God.</P>
<P>To conclude, they have a wonderful &s;light in &s;tealing, and one of the <HI>Scheiks</HI> who went with me to Mount <HI>Sinai,</HI> told me, that if he plea&s;ed, he could in the Night-time, kill the <HI>Bey</HI> of <HI>Suez</HI> in his Bed, in &s;pight of all his Guards, and though all his Doors were &s;hut. And a little before I came to <HI>Caire,</HI> three <HI>Arabs</HI> contending together which of them was the nimble&s;t Rogue, one brag'd that he could &s;teal all that was in the Kitchin of the Ba&s;ha; the other thinking that to be but a &s;mall matter, &s;aid that he would &s;teal the Ba&s;ha's Signet, or Seal; and the third offered to do more than they both, &s;aying, he would

kill the Ba&s;ha in his Bed. The fir&s;t made a &s;hift to &s;lip into the Kitchin, and in the Night-time carried all away, not leaving &s;o much as a Skillet; the &s;econd thronging in among tho&s;e, who one day entred into the place where the Ba&s;ha was Sealing, got pretty near to him, and the Ba&s;ha having &s;ealed &s;omething, and offering the Seal to &s;ome body to hold, this Knave &s;tretched out his hand, and having received it, &s;hortly after di&s;appeared: The third went &s;o far that he &s;lid into the Ba&s;ha's Appartment, and entring into his Chamber in the Night-time, came to his Beds-&s;ide, where having drawn his Cangiar, his hand was up to have &s;tabbed him, when a little Boy, who was in the Bed, and &s;aw the glittering light of the Cangiar, cried out &s;o loud, that the Ba&s;ha &s;tarting up, avoided the blow: Immediately Servants came in, and &s;eized the Villain, who was next day Empaled for it.</P>

<P>BEing come back to <HI>Suez,</HI> we went and thanked the Bey for his kindne&s;s, and &s;eeing there was no Caravan ready to &s;et out, we had time enough to con&s;ider <HI>Suez,</HI> and the Red-Sea: This Sea which many think is &s;o called becau&s;e its Water is Red, others more rationally becau&s;e the Sand of it is Red, is no Redder than any other Sea, neither in its Water nor Sand; only I ob&s;erved as I went to Mount <HI>Sinai,</HI> &s;ome Mountains all over Red upon the &s;ides of it, but I believe, the rea&s;on why it is called Red, is: That the Tran&s;lators of the Greek into Latin, having in the Greek found the <HI>Erythrean</HI> Sea, have taken that word in Greek for Red, not con&s;idering that it is the Name of an ancient King called <HI>Erythra;</HI> who hath given his Name to that Sea,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Erythra.</NOTE> which Name reaches a good way beyond the Gulf of <HI>Arabia,</HI> comprehending all the Sea that is betwixt the Ea&s;tern Coa&s;t of <HI>Africa,</HI> and the <HI>Indies.</HI> See <HI>Arrian</HI>'s Na|vigation of the <HI>Erythrean</HI> Sea. This Sea in the holy Scripture is called <HI>Yam Souf,</HI> that is to &s;ay, the Sea of Ru&s;hes, becau&s;e the Banks of it are full of Ru&s;hes. And the <HI>Arabs</HI> call it <HI>Buhr el Calzem,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Buhr el Cal|zem. Cly&s;ma.</NOTE> as if one &s;hould &s;ay the Sea of <HI>Cly&s;ma,</HI> becau&s;e of the Town named <HI>Cly&s;ma,</HI> which was heretofore built at the mo&s;t Northern point of that Sea, which is a Gulf of the Ocean, growing narrower and narrower the more Northward it runs; and during the &s;pace of five days that I kept along the Coa&s;t of it in going to Mount <HI>Sinai,</HI> I could not ob&s;erve it to be any where above eight or nine Miles over. This Sea ebbs and flows like the Ocean.

It was a Sea of great Trade, before the di&s;covery of the way to the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indies</HI> by the Cape of <HI>Good Hope,</HI> by which the Portugue&s;e, Engli&s;h, Dutch, and others, &s;ail now to the <HI>Indies,</HI> and bring us the Drugs, Spices, Pretious Stones, Pearls, and many other Commodities, which for the mo&s;t part came formerly only by <HI>Aleppo,</HI> or by the Red-Sea, and were unload|ed at the Port of <HI>Co&s;&s;ir,</HI> from whence they were carried to the Town of <HI>Chana,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Co&s;&s;ir.

It hath a pretty Harbour, but &s;o &s;hallow Water, that Ships cannot put into it, and the Galleys them&s;elves mu&s;t be half unloaded before they enter into it; never|thele&s;s, Ships and all ride &s;afe enough in the Road. The&s;e Galleys are very little, they carry no great Guns, but only a <HI>Petrera</HI> to &s;alute the Ports where they arrive. Clo&s;e by the Harbour there is a <HI>Baraque,</HI> railed in with great wooden Pali&s;&s;adoes, where are nine <HI>Culverines,</HI> every one longer than another, of which the bigge&s;t is of a prodigious length, and I take it to be much longer, and of a far wider bore, than the two which are at <HI>Malta</HI> upon the <HI>Baraque,</HI> and in the Ca&s;tle St. <HI>Erme;</HI> they are of the Turki&s;h make, and nothing of Workman&s;hip about them.

The&s;e Guns are not mounted, and were &s;ent thither from <HI>Con&s;tantinople</HI> by <HI>Sultan Amurat,</HI> on a de&s;ign he had of attempting an Expedition into the <HI>Indies,</HI> with a Fleet fitted out on that Sea. Clo&s;e by the Gate of <HI>Suez</HI> there is an Eminence, where heretofore &s;tood a Ca&s;tle built by the Franks, and upon the &s;ame Eminence there is &s;till a great Gun. The Slaves told us, that the People of the Country believe, there is &s;ome Trea&s;ure near that place guarded by Hobgoblins; for my part, that Night we arrived from Mount <HI>Sinai,</HI> I lay at the foot of that Eminence, and the Sprights did not at all di&s;turb my re&s;t. There is in this Town &s;till a Greek Church, but in bad order. There are &s;ome pretty well built Hou&s;es in <HI>Suez,</HI> and an indifferent good Market-place. To conclude, this Town is very Populous, when any Ship arrives, or when the Galleys are in the Harbour, but at other times it is very De&s;olate; and indeed, there is not &s;o much as any good Fre&s;h Water within two Leagues round it.</P>

<P>This Caravan from <HI>Caire</HI> to <HI>Suez,</HI> and from <HI>Suez</HI> to <HI>Caire,</HI> travels com|monly very fa&s;t, becau&s;e it cannot &s;pend much time by the way, for other|wi&s;e they would fall &s;hort of provi&s;ions, having none but what they carry with them, both for Men and Camels, and therefore they never &s;tay above two or three days at <HI>Suez,</HI> and if they &s;tayed longer, they would &s;tarve that Town, where there is nothing but what is brought in from the Countrey about, when the Galleys or &s;ome Ships arrive; and indeed, the&s;e Camel drivers are always &s;o weary and &s;pent, that they can hardly &s;tir, they have not &s;o much as time to &s;leep, and now and then they run before the Caravan and tumbling down uPon the ground, fall pre&s;ently a &s;leep, taking there a &s;hort nap till the Caravan be pa&s;t, when &s;ome take care to awaken them. In this Journey from <HI>Suez</HI> to <HI>Caire,</HI> for a days time and more we had &s;o hot a Wind, that we were forced to turn our backs to it,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A dangerous hot Wind.</NOTE> to take a little breath, and &s;o &s;oon as we opened our mouths, they were full of Sand: our Water was &s;o extreamly heated with it, that it &s;eemed to be ju&s;t taken off of the Fire: and many poor People of the Caravan, came and begged of us a cup of water for Gods &s;ake; for our parts we could not drink it, it was &s;o hot, The Camels were &s;o infe&s;ted with this Wind, that they could not &s;o much as feed; but it la&s;ted not above &s;ix hours in its force; and if it had continued longer, one half of the Caravan would have peri&s;hed. It was &s;uch a kind of wind that the year before &s;o infe&s;ted the Caravan of <HI>Mecha,</HI> that two thou&s;and men died of it in one night.<NOTE PLACE="marg">A great Mor|tality by that Wind.</NOTE> In this Journey I ob&s;erved that when the feet of the Camels were cut and galled, the Camel drivers took the Bones of dead Camels, (of which all the way from <HI>Caire</HI> to <HI>Suez</HI> is &s;o full, that following only the tract where the&s;e Bones ly, one may go the &s;treight way to <HI>Suez</HI>) they took the&s;e Bones (I &s;ay) and with the marrow they fonnd in them anointed the &s;ore place of the Camel.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Gaza.</NOTE>THE City of <HI>Gaza</HI> is about two miles from the Sea, and was anciently very Illu&s;trious, as may be &s;een by its Ruines, for you have Marble-Pillars every where, and I have &s;een Burying-places there, where the Tombs were wholly made of Marble; among others, there is one enclo&s;ed with a wall, which belongs to &s;ome particular Turki&s;h Family, and is full of lovely Sepulchres, made of large pieces of excellent Marble, which are the remains and evidences of the ancient &s;plendour of that Town: It was one of the five Lord&s;hips of the <HI>Philistins,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Lord&s;hips of the <HI>Phili&s;tins.</HI></NOTE> to which <HI>Sam&s;on</HI> did &s;o much hurt, nay, and one day carried away upon his Shoulders the Gates of this City, and left them upon a little hill at a miles di&s;tance. The Ca&s;tle is near the Town, and is round, with a Tower at each corner, four in all; it is kept in good order, and has but a &s;mall circumference, but two Iron-Gates. Hard by this Ca&s;tle is the <HI>Serraglio</HI> of the Ba&s;ha's Wives, and joining to it above, &s;ome pieces of old wall, of a matter &s;o compact that it cannot be broken with a Hammer; it is the ruines of the Ca&s;tle of the <HI>Romans.</HI> The Town is but very little, it hath a <HI>Beze&s;tein</HI> in very good order, and a pretty large Greek Church, whereof the arched Roof in the middle is &s;upported by two great Pillars of Marble, with their Corin&s;hes of the Corinthian order; they &s;ay, that our Lady was three days there, when &s;he fled into <HI>Aegypt:</HI> The <HI>Arme|nians</HI> have a Church there al&s;o.

From <HI>Caire</HI> till we came thither we found no Wine, but there we had &s;ome pretty good, wherewith we provided our&s;elves, and might have had pretty good Brandy too, if we had had occa&s;ion.

Proceeding on our way, about an hundred paces farther, we pa&s;&s;ed under the Arch upon which <HI>Pilate</HI> &s;et our Lord, &s;aying, <HI>Behold the man;</HI> it is a large Arch, reaching from one &s;ide of the &s;treet to the other:<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Arch of <HI>Ecce Homo.</HI></NOTE> This Arch hath two Windows that look into the &s;treet, which are &s;eparated only by a little Marble Pillar: Under the&s;e Windows, is this In&s;cription, <HI>Tolle, Tolle, Crucifige eum.</HI> Beyond that Arch, at the end of a &s;treet on the left hand, is the Palace of <HI>Herod,</HI> where our Lord was cloathed with a white Robe in deri&s;ion, and &s;ent back to <HI>Pilate,</HI> with whom <HI>Herod</HI> being formerly at variance, was that day reconciled.

The length of the place on which her Body was put is nine Spans, the breadth four, and the height as much. It is covered with a Stone of a greyi&s;h Marble, with Veins in it, and in &s;ome places is broken.

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. XXXIX.</HI> Of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre.</HEAD>
<P>BEfore I leave the&s;e holy Places, I mu&s;t (according to my promi&s;e) &s;ay &s;omething of them. This Church is very &s;pacious, the <HI>Nef</HI> or Body of it is round, and receives no Light but from the top of the Dome above, which is much like the Dome of the <HI>Rotunda</HI> at <HI>Rome.</HI> This Dome is on the out-&s;ide covered with Lead, within it is Wain&s;cotted with Cedar Wood, which St. <HI>Helen</HI> gave for that u&s;e when &s;he built that Church, becau&s;e it rots not. The opening of the Dome is covered with a Wire Lettice, that hinders Birds from coming into the Church. In the middle of this <HI>Nef,</HI> and ju&s;t un|der the opening of the Dome, is the holy Sepulchre, but before you enter into that &s;o holy place, you mu&s;t pa&s;s over a place rai&s;ed a Foot high from the Floor of the Church, there being on each &s;ide a Seat or Bank of White Mar|ble, about two Foot and a half high, where the Religious that a&s;&s;i&s;t at the Celebration of the Ma&s;s of the holy Sepulchre (where none but Latins can Cele|brate) &s;it. From thence you pa&s;s through the Chappel of the Angel, &s;o called, becau&s;e in that place the Angel told the three <HI>Maries,</HI> that our Lord was Ri&s;en; it is about fourteen Span long, &s;ix in breadth, and about nine Foot high. This Chappel hath not been cut out of the Rock, as that of the holy Sepulchre, but hath been built for Ornament, and joyned to the Chappel of the holy Sepulchre. In this Chappel there is a little Altar, and three little Windows, to give light to the place. Before the Door of that Chappel there is a Lamp, and &s;eventeen Lamps within it. In the &s;ame Chappel ju&s;t before, and within a Foot and a half of the Door of the holy Sepulchre, there is a &s;quare Stone cut out of the Rock, and rai&s;ed about a Foot from the Ground, it &s;erved for a &s;upport to the Stone which &s;hut the Sepulchre, and upon that Stone the Angel &s;at, when the three <HI>Maries</HI> came to look for the Body of our Lord. Next to that, you enter into the Chappel of the holy Sepulchre, the Door of which is three Foot high, and two Foot wide; all enter into it bare|footed, and it is &s;o little, that it cannot contain but three Men kneeling, and four make a great crowd. On the Right Hand as you enter, is the place where the Body of our Lord was laid, and not within it, as many believe; for in tho&s;e times the Sepulchres were little Grotts cut in the Rock, wherein there was a Table of the &s;ame Rock, on which the Body was laid, and the entry into the Grott was &s;hut with a great &s;tone, which was &s;upported by a little Bench cut on the out-&s;ide of the Rock. This Table is about two Foot and a half, rai&s;ed from the Floor, taking up one half of the breadth, and the whole length of the &s;aid Chappel; it hath been faced with White Marble, becau&s;e all the Chri&s;tians that went thither, &s;trove to have &s;ome little bit of it. It &s;erves for an Altar to the Latin Prie&s;ts who Celebrate Ma&s;s, none el&s;e being permitted to Celebrate there. This place in&s;pires great Devotion even into the mo&s;t undevout; as I found by my &s;elf. The Chappel is cut out of the Rock, and there are three holes in the Roof of it, through which the &s;moak of the Lamps that burn there does evaporate, there being no other opening into this place, but the three holes and Door, &s;o that it is very hot being in it. There are four and forty Lamps in it, all &s;ent by the Emperours, and the Kings of <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Spain.</HI> This whole place is faced within and without with White Marble, and environed on the out-&s;ide by ten lovely Pillars of White Marble, and Lamps round about it, It is covered with a Plat-form, in the middle whereof, ju&s;t over the holes by which the &s;moak of the Lamps evaporates, there is a little Dome, about &s;ix Foot high covered with Lead, and this little Dome &s;tands upon twelve little Pillars of the colour of Por|phyrie, placed two and two upon the Plat-form, and &s;o making &s;ix Arches, under every one of which hang three Lamps. When it Rains, the Water falls

Before the door of the holy Sepulchre, at an equal di&s;tance from it and the door of the Quire, there is &s;o va&s;t a Lamp of Silver, that two Men can hardly fathom it about, it is pulled down and up with a Windle&s;s. The Arms of <HI>Spain</HI> are cut on it in eight places, and all round below is this In&s;cription, <HI>Philippus</HI> III. <HI>Rex Hi&s;paniarum me donavit.</HI> The Turks have many times had a great mind to take this Lamp, and &s;end it to <HI>Mecha.</HI> Ju&s;t before the door of the holy Sepulchre,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Quire of the Church of St. <HI>Sepulchre</HI></NOTE> is the Quire of the Church, which belongs to the Greeks, and is encompa&s;&s;ed with great Pillars, and &s;hut in with Walls; it is covered with a Dome of Free-&s;tone all clo&s;e, and rough Ca&s;t on the out-&s;ide. This Quire hath three doors, to wit, one over again&s;t the entry into the holy Sepulchre, and one on each &s;ide towards the High Altar: There are &s;everal Lamps in it, and a very neat Candle&s;tick of Copper &s;haped like a Crown, &s;ent by a Duke of <HI>Mo&s;covy</HI> for the holy Sepulchre, but &s;eeing there was no room for it there, it was given to the Greeks, who hung it up with Iron chains towards the door of the Quire within; it can hold &s;ixty four Tapers, and a great many Lamps, Under this Candle&s;tick, there is a Marble-&s;tone in the Pavement, in which there is a little hole, and the Oriental Chri&s;tians &s;ay it is the Middle of the World,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The middle of the World in St. <HI>Sepulchre</HI></NOTE> becau&s;e it is &s;aid in Holy Scripture, that <HI>God wrought &s;alvation in the mid&s;t of the earth,</HI> P&s;al. 74.

Behind the&s;e Pillars, all round the Church, the Oriental Chri&s;tians have made their Lodgings. The &s;ame Pillars and Columns bear a &s;econd &s;tory in form of a Gallery, that ranges round the Church: Upon this Gallery there are &s;everal other Pillars, which &s;upport the re&s;t of the Church, and make as it were &s;everal Windows to this Gallery, over which there are &s;ome Mo&s;aical Pictures repre&s;enting the Prophets, Apo&s;tles, St. <HI>Helen</HI> and <HI>Con&s;tantine.</HI> All that Gallery belonged to the <HI>Latin</HI> Monks, but the <HI>Armenians</HI> have &s;o far prevailed, that they have obtained a good part of it, which they have &s;eparated by Partitions, &s;o that one cannot now go all round.

The Altar in the middle is dedicated to the honour of the Virgin <HI>Mary;</HI> the Altar on the left hand, to the Honour of the Holy Cro&s;s, which in this place was tryed by St. <HI>Helen</HI> upon a dead Body that was rai&s;ed by the touch of the Cro&s;s of our Lord, the other two having been applied to it without any effect. A piece of the &s;ame Cro&s;s was kept there for a long time, till the <HI>Armenians</HI> &s;tole it away.

<P>THE &s;ame day we returned from <HI>Jordan,</HI> which was Holy <HI>Wedne&s;day</HI> the &s;eventeenth of <HI>April,</HI> after we had dined in the Convent of St. <HI>Saviour,</HI> we entred a &s;econd time into the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, but the Greeks entered not till the nineteenth of <HI>April,</HI> (which was Holy <HI>Friday</HI>) in the Afternoon, &s;o that we had two days quietly to perform our Devotions in. On Holy <HI>Thur&s;day</HI> the eighteenth of <HI>April</HI> in the Morning, we received the Ble&s;&s;ed Sacrament from the hands of the reverend Father Commi&s;&s;ary, and in the Afternoon went in Proce&s;&s;ion to the holy Sepulchre, at the door whereof, the reverend Father Commi&s;&s;ary wa&s;hed the Feet of twelve Monks and Pilgrims, of the number of whom, we were; for when there is a &s;ufficient number of Pilgrims, they take no Monks, but when they are fewer than twelve, the num|ber is made up with Monks; as al&s;o when there are more than twelve Pilgrims, they ca&s;t Lots who &s;hall be admitted, (as it happened the year before I was there) when there was one and twenty, of whom, nine were excluded by Lot; we &s;at down then all twelve upon the two &s;eats of Marble that are near to the Chappel of the Angel,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Wa&s;hing of Feet.</NOTE> and the Reverend Father Commi&s;&s;ary wa&s;hed all our Feet and ki&s;&s;ed them, giving to every one of us afterwards a Cro&s;s full of Relicks. All the Oriental Chri&s;tians who were in the Church, (for &s;ome went in with us) crouded much to &s;ee that Ceremony, mo&s;t part weeping and cry|ing aloud when they &s;aw the good old man on his knees wa&s;hing our Feet. On holy <HI>Friday</HI> the ninteenth of <HI>April,</HI> when the evening Office was over, we went in Proce&s;&s;ion through all the Sanctuaries of the great Church, where all the my&s;teries of the Pa&s;&s;ion were repre&s;ented to the Life;<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Proce&s;&s;i|on of Holy <HI>Friday.</HI></NOTE> in this Proce&s;&s;ion there were two Monks who carried the one a Box of Aromaticks, and the other a Bottle of odoriferous Oyl; every one of the Monks had a lighted Wax-Taper, and the R.

them&s;elves with their Sticks, having no veneration for their Ceremonies, as they have for ours. We &s;topped fir&s;t at the Chappel of the Pillar of Flagel|lation, where having &s;ung the Prayers that are for that place in Books which were given us, an <HI>Italian</HI> preach'd upon that Subject; then we went to the Pri&s;on of our Lord; where having &s;ung the Prayers for that place, a French man made a very good Sermon. From thence we went to the Chappel of the parting of the Garments, where after Prayers there was an Italian Sermon; then to the Chappel of Exprobration, where after Prayers, we had a French Sermon: being gone up to <HI>Calvary,</HI> we came to the place where our Saviour was nailed to the Cro&s;s, and there having &s;ung the proper Prayers for that place, there was a Sermon in high Dutch. From thence we went to the place where the Cro&s;s was planted, and having put the Crucifix into the &s;ame hole where the holy Cro&s;s &s;tood, on which our Saviour was Crucified, and then Sung the Prayers of the place; there was a Sermon made in Greek, which wrought much upon the Greeks, who were very attentive, and &s;hed many Tears; then the Crucifix was taken off of the Cro&s;s, and wrapped in a Linen-Cloath: After|wards being come down again, we went to the Stone of Unction, on which the Crucifix in the &s;heet was laid, and after Prayers was &s;aid, there was a Latin Sermon; after which the R.F. Commi&s;&s;ary anointed the Crucifix with the Oyl and aromatick Spices, then wrapped it up in a Sheet, and from thence we proceeded towards the holy Sepulchre; but hardly were we ri&s;en up from about the &s;tone of Unction, when all the other Chri&s;tians (who followed the Proce&s;&s;ion) ca&s;t them&s;elves in crouds upon the &s;aid Stone, rubbing Linen-Cloaths upon it, that they might dry up what of the Oyl and Aromaticks had fallen upon the Stone, as a great Relick, all ki&s;&s;ing it with great Devotion. Being come to the holy Sepulchre, the Crucifix was laid upon it, and then having Sung the proper Prayers for the place, we had an excellent Sermon in Spani&s;h. <HI>Saturday</HI> the twentieth of <HI>April,</HI> the Reverend Father Commi&s;&s;ary performed the Office before the holy Sepulchre, and made u&s;e of the ornaments given by <HI>Lovis</HI> the thirteenth, late King of <HI>France,</HI> which are all mo&s;t richly Em|broadered, and a compleat Service of them.

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. XLIII.</HI> Of the Holy Fire of the Greeks and other Schi&s;matical Chri&s;tians.</HEAD>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The holy Fire of the Greeks, Armenians, Cophtes, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></NOTE>WHen our Office was ended, we made ready to have the plea&s;ure of the Holy Fire of the <HI>Greeks, Armenians</HI> and <HI>Cophtes,</HI> which the Prie&s;ts make the People believe comes down from Heaven into the Holy Sepulchre on <HI>Holy-Saturday,</HI> and for that make every one of their Pilgrims pay &s;o much Money, who are always very numerous. This Solemnity looks more like a Comedy or Farce, than a Ceremony of the Church, and would be more proper for a Stage than for &s;uch a Sacred place as the holy Sepulchre is; and indeed, the Turks take up their places betimes, and come in great numbers to have the plea&s;ure of it. We took our places in our Galleries. After we had con|cluded our Service then, (which was about eight a clock in the morning) they put out all their Lamps, and the Lamps of the holy Sepulchre, and then began their folly, running about the holy Sepulchre like mad men, howling, roaring, and making a horrid noi&s;e, without any re&s;pect to the place where they were: Every time they pa&s;&s;ed before the Holy Sepulchre, they cried <HI>Elee&s;on,</HI> and it was plea&s;ant to &s;ee them run one after another, kicking one another on the Breech, and with Ropes-ends laying one another over the
<PB N="197" REF="118">
Shoulders: Several of them joined together in a body, and carrying men upon their Arms, as they pa&s;&s;ed by the holy Sepulchre let them fall, and then bur&s;t out in Laughter, while they who had fallen, run after the others to be revenged of them: In &s;hort, one would have taken them all for down right mad People; and it was not only little Boys, but men both old and young that did &s;o. From time to time they lifted their Eyes up to <HI>Heaven,</HI> and &s;tretched out their hands full of Wax-Tapers, crying all together <HI>Elee&s;on,</HI> as if they were weary of expecting the holy Fire, and would obtain it from God by force. This con|tinued till about three a Clock in the Afternoon, when two Greek Arch-Bi&s;hops and two Bi&s;hops being cloathed in Patriarchal Robes, (for the Patriarch was not at that time in <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI>) came out of their Quire with all their Clergy, and began the Proce&s;&s;ion about the holy Sepulchre; the <HI>Armenians</HI> came al&s;o and followed that Proce&s;&s;ion, there being four <HI>Armenians</HI> with Mitres after the Latin fa&s;hion; then came a Cophti&s;h Bi&s;hop with his Clergy and People, going all di&s;tinctly, but yet following clo&s;e after one another. After they had con|tinued their Proce&s;&s;ion three times round the holy Sepulchre, a Greek Prie&s;t came out of the Chappel of the Angel and told him who &s;upplied the place of the Patriarch, that the holy Fire was come down from <HI>Heaven,</HI> then he went into the holy Sepulchre, having in each hand a bunch of Wax-Candles; he was followed in by him that repre&s;ented the <HI>Armenian</HI> Patriarch. and the Cophti&s;h Bi&s;hop, the door of the Chappel of the Angel, being in the mean time guarded by <HI>Janizaries.</HI> When they had been a little while there, we &s;aw the Greek Arch-Bi&s;hop comeing out in a very plea&s;ant po&s;ture, he marched with his head down, having in each Fi&s;t a bunch of Wax-Candles all lighted; no &s;ooner did he appear, but they all fell a &s;triving who &s;hould fir&s;t light his Candle at the Arch-Bi&s;hops, it being the be&s;t Fire that is &s;oone&s;t lighted; in the mean time the <HI>Janizaries</HI> hands were not in their Pockets, they hurled the Greeks Caps and Calpecs from one end of the Church to the other, and laid about them on all hands with their Cudgels, to make way for the poor Arch-Bi&s;hop, who was doing on his part the be&s;t he could to make his e&s;cape too. The Arch-Bi&s;hop being freed a little, got quickly upon a &s;tone-Altar, that is before the door of the Quire, over again&s;t the entry of the holy Sepul|chre, where the People immediately flocked about him; tho&s;e al&s;o who having lighted their Candles, endeavoured to get out of the Croud, were run down by the re&s;t; in &s;hort, there was a horrible confu&s;ion, and plenty of Blows be&s;towed. After that the Greek Arch-Bi&s;hop was come out, the <HI>Armenian</HI> came next, and made his e&s;cape towards the Church of the <HI>Armenians,</HI> as the Cophti&s;h Prelate did towards his own Church; in the mean time the <HI>Janizaries</HI> kept the door of the holy Sepulchre, and &s;uffered none to enter but &s;uch as gave them &s;everal <HI>Maidins,</HI> that they might light their Candles at the Lamps of the holy Sepulchre, where the holy Fire fir&s;t was: All made &s;o much ha&s;te to catch this holy fire, that in a &s;hort time their candles were all lighted, &s;o that in a trice there were above two thou&s;and bunches of Candles flaming in the Church; then began all to cry again and play more fooli&s;h tricks than before, and immediately a man with a Drum upon his back, fell a running with all &s;peed round the holy Sepulchre, while another at his heels beat upon the Drum with two &s;ticks, and when he was weary, another in&s;tantly &s;upplied his place, however by little and little the noi&s;e le&s;&s;ened, and we began to look about towards all the parts of the Church both above and below, and there con&s;ider men and women, who having by them pieces of Cloath, enough to &s;et up a &s;hop, unfolded them, and at every &s;pans length made Cro&s;&s;es with their lighted Candles in them; this Cloath &s;erves them to be buried in, and for that end they keep it, as if it were a Relick; during this Solemnity, one would certainly think him&s;elf in <HI>Hell</HI> amid&s;t a Legion of Devils let loo&s;e, and neverthele&s;s, the mo&s;t &s;erious cannot forbear Laughing at it: After that is over, they perform their office and then go eat, for they neither eat nor drink that day, before they have had the holy Fire. Now it is impo&s;&s;ible to know how they make this holy Fire, for they have a &s;pecial care that nobody comes near the holy Sepulchre to ob&s;erve them, but I am apt to beleive that a man hid within it &s;trikes Fire with a Steel, and &s;o lights the Lamps. The Turks di&s;covered the Cheat, and would have puni&s;hed them for it, but the Patriarch repre&s;ented to them, that
<PB N="198" REF="119">
he could not pay them &s;o much Money as he did, if they took from him the profit of the holy Fire, and therefore they are &s;uffered to continue the Juggle. Next day the one and twentieth of <HI>April,</HI> being <HI>Ea&s;ter</HI> day, the R. F. Com|mi&s;&s;ary &s;aid high Ma&s;s upon an Altar, purpo&s;ely erected before the door of the holy Sepulchre, a Father playing upon the Organ, to which the Turks were very attentive, but in the mean time purfumed us with the Smoak of their Tobacco, and one of them fairly lighted his Pipe at one of the Tapers upon the Altar, during the time that high Ma&s;s was &s;aying. At this Ma&s;s we all received the Sacrament from the hands of the R. F. Commi&s;&s;ary. That day we u&s;ed Ornaments given by the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> which are very rich in Em|broadery; but &s;eeing it is not a compleat Service, they made up what was wanting, out of tho&s;e that were given by the King of <HI>France.</HI> The R. F. was very apprehen&s;ive that the Greeks might di&s;turb our Service, becau&s;e they had re&s;olved to perform theirs before ours, but all was very well, and we performed our Service fir&s;t, though they made as if they would come out of the Quire and begin their Proce&s;&s;ion at the &s;ame time we began our Ma&s;s; however they dur&s;t not, and perhaps they would have got nothing by it, for we had <HI>Jani|zaries</HI> that would have hindred them. They &s;tayed then till our Service was over, and then began theirs. For our parts &s;o &s;oon as Ma&s;s was &s;aid, we went out of the Church of St. <HI>Sepulchre,</HI> and dined in the Convent of St. <HI>Saviour,</HI> where every one of us found two Chaplets and two Cro&s;&s;es, (which had been touched at the Holy places) upon our Plates.

Hereto|fore all this Church was lined with beautiful Marble, as may be ea&s;ily &s;een by the Cramp-Irons fixed all over in the Wall, which have held the pieces; but the Turks have removed the&s;e Ornaments for their Mo&s;ques. As you enter that Church, you &s;ee on the right hand behind the third and fourth Pillars the Greeks Font, which is very fine. The Quire is &s;till very large, and clo&s;ed all, round with a Wall; the <HI>Armenians</HI> have a third part of it, which was given them by the <HI>Latins</HI> whil&s;t they po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the Church; and they have &s;eparated it from the re&s;t by wooden Rails. As you enter this Quire, you &s;ee on each &s;ide a kind of Chappel, and almo&s;t at the farther end of it &s;tands the high Al|tar, which with the&s;e two Chappels makes a Cro&s;s; in that which is on the right hand, there is an Altar, where you &s;ee the Stone on which our Lord was Circumci&s;ed: In the other Chappel, on the left hand, which belongs to the <HI>Armenians,</HI> there is an Altar, which they &s;ay, is the place where the Kings alighted from their Hor&s;es, when they came to adore our Lord. On the right &s;ide of the high Altar, there is a pair of Stairs, by which you go up to a Tower on the out-&s;ide of the Quire, it was formerly the Steeple of the Church, and &s;erves at pre&s;ent for Lodgings for the <HI>Greeks.</HI> There are al&s;o many Pillars in the Quire like to tho&s;e in the <HI>Nef,</HI> and which with the&s;e of the <HI>Nef,</HI> make in all fifty Pillars. Near to the high Altar in the Quire, there are two little Mar|ble Stair-ca&s;es, one on each &s;ide, having thirteen &s;teps apiece, and being gone down &s;ix of them, you find a neat Brazen Door well wrought, and pierced through to let in light from above; pa&s;&s;ing it you come to the foot of the Stairs, which lead into a little Church, reaching only in length from the one Stair-ca&s;e to the other: Much under the great Altar of the Quire, at this end betwixt the afore&s;aid two Stair-ca&s;es, there is an Altar, under which is the place where our Saviour was Born; this place is faced with lovely Marble, in the middle whereof there is a Glory of Silver like the Sun, with this In|&s;cription about it, <HI>Hic de Virgine Maria, Je&s;us Chri&s;tus natus e&s;t.</HI> About half a

Then you go down by three Marble-&s;teps, into a little Chappel, where was the Wooden Manger into which the Virgin laid our Lord, &s;o &s;oon as She had brought Him into the World; this Manger is now at <HI>Rome,</HI> in <HI>Santa Maria Majora.</HI> And in the &s;ame place St. <HI>Helen</HI> cau&s;ed another of white Marble Tables to be put, on one of which &s;et again&s;t the Wall, is the natural Figure of an Old Man with a Monks Hood, and long Beard, lying on his Back; and they'll have this to be the Figure of St. <HI>Jerome,</HI> which God was plea&s;ed &s;hould be marked upon that Stone, becau&s;e of the great love he had for that place. Ten Lamps are kept burning before that Chappel; two &s;teps from which, and ju&s;t over again&s;t it, is the Altar of <HI>Adoration</HI> of the Three Kings, where there is a little Stone for a mark of the place,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The place of the Kings Adoration.</NOTE> on which &s;at the holy Virgin with Her dear Son in Her Arms, when She &s;aw the three Wi&s;e Men come in, who having laid down their Pre&s;ents upon a little Bench of Stone at the foot of the Altar, on the &s;ide of the Epi&s;tle, adored <HI>Je&s;us,</HI> and then offered him their Pre&s;ents. The Vault in this place is very low, and &s;upported by three Pillars of Porphyrian Marble; before this Altar, three Lamps burn. At the other end of this place, there was heretofore a Door, by which one came down from St. <HI>Catharine</HI>'s Chappel into this Grott, before the Latin Monks lo&s;t it, but at pre&s;ent it is Walled up; and clo&s;e by that Door there is a hole, into which the Oriental Chri&s;tians &s;ay, the Star &s;unk after it had guided the <HI>Magi</HI> into this holy place. This Grott is all faced with Mar|ble, both the Walls and Floor, and the Seeling or Vault, is adorned with Mo|&s;aick Work, blackened by the &s;moak of the Lamps. It receives no light but by the two Doors that are upon the Stairs, which affords but very little. Now this place is held in very great Veneration, even by the Turks, who come often and &s;ay their prayers there:<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Church of <HI>Bethlehem</HI> &s;erves for a lodging to the Turks that pa&s;s that way.</NOTE> But it is a very incommodious and un|&s;eemly thing, that all the Turks who pa&s;s through <HI>Bethlehem,</HI> &s;hould Lodge in the great Church, with their whole Families, there being no convenient Lodg|ing in <HI>Bethlehem,</HI> which is a great Eye-&s;ore to the Chri&s;tians, who &s;ee their Church made an Inn for the Infidels: But it is above all, trouble&s;ome to our Latin Monks, whom they oblige to furni&s;h them with all things nece&s;&s;ary, both for Diet and Lodging.</P>

<P><HI>WEdne&s;day</HI> the Four and twentieth of <HI>April,</HI> we parted from <HI>Bethlehem,</HI> at five a Clock in the Morning, and went to &s;ee the holy places that are about it.

<P>WE &s;tayed &s;ome days at <HI>Jaffa,</HI> not only becau&s;e the Bark had not in as yet all her Lading, but al&s;o becau&s;e of the Weather. At length, every thing being in readine&s;s, we went on board a Bark of the French Nation of <HI>Acre, Sunday</HI> the fifth of <HI>May,</HI> about &s;even a clock in the morning, and making all the &s;ail we could,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Antipatris.

<P>Being got near then to Mount <HI>Carmel,</HI> which runs out a great way into the Sea, we &s;aw on the other &s;ide of the Point, the top of a Ma&s;t, which at fir&s;t we took to be &s;ome Bark at anchor near the &s;hore, but afterwards &s;eeing a <HI>Caique</HI> full of Men making towards us, our <HI>Reys,</HI> (who was a Turk,) told us they were Chri&s;tians, and pre&s;ently went into his <HI>Caique,</HI> and put into &s;hoar, where were a great many <HI>Arabs</HI> both on Foot and on Hor&s;e-back, who called to us, and we were &s;o near land, that we plainly heard them call in Arabick, <HI>Taala, Cor&s;a min Malta;</HI> Come, it is a Cor&s;air of <HI>Malta;</HI> calling all Ve&s;&s;els in cour&s;e &s;uch, becau&s;e they often receive Vi&s;ites from the&s;e Gentlemen: But at this time they &s;aid true, and the &s;ame <HI>Arabs</HI> fired Small-&s;hot briskly at them, which for all that, hindred them not from making up to us: When I knew them to be Chri&s;tians, I per&s;waded a Greek that remained behind, and &s;tood by the Helm, to &s;teer right towards them, &s;ince taking them for Friends, I would not go a-&s;hoar where we would have been &s;tript by the <HI>Arabs,</HI> who left our

<HI>Reys</HI> &s;tark naked as &s;oon as he had landed.

Within a very little after, the&s;e Blades came up with us, and though a Capucin of our company called to them at a di&s;tance, that we were <HI>French,</HI> and that being near, they &s;aw nobody upon the Deck, neverthele&s;s when they were broad&s;ide and broad&s;ide with us, they fired a Petrera, charged with Musket-Bullets, and all their &s;mall Shot into our Bark; I &s;hall not name that Knight for his Honours &s;ake. The&s;e Ra&s;cals (becau&s;e of their bad conduct) at that time de&s;erved to have met with about thirty Turks on board of us, who might ea&s;ily have ma&s;tered them, having di&s;charged all their Shot. When they had done this brave act, they made ha&s;te up, and we came out to &s;hew our|&s;elves; but the&s;e young Villains cur&s;ing and &s;wearing like Devils, that they might appear more terrible to unarmed men, would not know us, though they them&s;elves were all French men too, and pre&s;ently fell a &s;tripping of us; for my &s;hare I was better &s;erved than a Prince, for though I told them I was a French man, I was be&s;et by five <HI>Valets de Chambre</HI> with a vengeance, of whom &s;ome were the Captains Brothers and Kin&s;men, who holding a Pi&s;tol to my Brea&s;t, and a Sword to my Belly, commanded me pre&s;ently to &s;trip, then pulling and halling one forwards, another backwards, one at the head, ano|ther at the feet, in the twinkling of an eye they left me &s;tark naked: I thought then that all was pa&s;t, when they began again to make &s;ome pa&s;&s;es at me, and perceiving that it was for a &s;orry Ring that I had on my finger, I quickly pull'd it off and threw it to them, for I began now partly to under&s;tand what the&s;e Blades were able to do; nay, when we were carried on board their Ship, one of them e&s;pying an incon&s;iderable plain Gold Ring on my Man's finger, &s;eemed very angry that he had not taken it, and when my Man told him that he him&s;elf could not get it off, he made him this free an&s;wer, That with all his heart he would have cut off the Finger for the Ring. When at length they had left me naked to my Shirt, I asked them who was their Commander, but to that they made me no an&s;wer. In the mean time, after all this din and clutter, (to which I was not at all accu&s;tomed,) I began to feel it cold, and one of our Monks in pity covered me with his Mantle, for they had not &s;tripp'd the Religious, though they &s;eemed to have a great mind to rifle them, to &s;ee if they had got any Money, and in that they had not lo&s;t their labour, for a Spaniard of our com|pany cunningly &s;lid his money into the &s;leeve of a Monk, and by that means &s;aved it. But now, (all being taken from me even to my very Cap,) I felt much cold in my head, becau&s;e I was &s;haved once a week, as being dre&s;s'd in the Habit of the Countrey. I prayed them to give me a Cap, and pre&s;ently they clapt upon my head one of their Caps, which they had recovered out of the Sea, wherein it was fallen. By that time all the hurly-burly was over, it it was night, and &s;o dark, that our Guards lo&s;t &s;ight of their Ship, which had put under &s;ail &s;o &s;oon as they knew that their Men were Ma&s;ters of our Bark, and &s;tood off to Sea, for fear of danger from the Shore. However the Lieutenant who Commanded the Crew that had taken us, had orders to follow the Ship with the Bark &s;o &s;oon as he was Ma&s;ter of her, and therefore he fired &s;everal Squibs from our Barks head, that the Ship might an&s;wer, and let him know where &s;he was: I was then extremely afraid they would have &s;et our Bark on fire, being full of Cotten, the Bags heaped one upon another; if that had happened, they would have made their e&s;cape in their Boat, and left us to be burnt alive, but God pre&s;erved us. Their Ship made an&s;wer with a Squib, and coming up with her a quarter of an hour after, we went on board. Pre&s;ently the Captain &s;ent us to the Poop, intending to make us lye abroad in the cold Air without Supper, and had the Monks into his Cabin, who having told him what I was, he came and called me by my name, and carried me down into his Cabin, where he pre&s;ently gave me Cloaths, and made many excu&s;es for the bad u&s;age I had met with, a&s;&s;uring me that I &s;hould lo&s;e none of my Cloaths, and withal telling me that he had &s;een me at <HI>Malta.</HI> Our Supper was but very mean, for he had no Provi&s;ions. In the mean time he
<PB N="210" REF="125">
gave me his Bed, the next day, the &s;ixth of <HI>May,</HI> he took a great deal of pains to make us recover our things again, but all in vain; only he got my <HI>Capot,</HI> a pair of Drawers, and &s;ome other Trifles, to be re&s;tored unto me, and at that the Ra&s;cals murmured too, &s;aying, That if they had killed us, they would not then be obliged to re&s;tore any thing. Then the Captain told us, that he mu&s;t needs &s;et us a&s;hoar, becau&s;e he had not Provi&s;ions enough for us; we thereupon prayed him to let us go in our Bark, which was loaded wholly for <HI>Frenchmen,</HI> but he told me that he was accountable to his Owners for that Bark, &s;o that he re&s;olved to turn us a&s;hoar, though I told him, that was the way to put us in danger of being burnt alive, if the <HI>Arabs</HI> &s;hould but fancy us to be Pirats; he ordered his <HI>Caique</HI> then to be made ready, but &s;eeing it could not carry us all at a time, was re&s;olved &s;he &s;hould do it at twice. For my part, I would not go off with the fir&s;t, judging the wor&s;t of every thing. And the truth is,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Caipha.</NOTE> this fir&s;t Voyage &s;ucceeded as I had imagined; for being pretty near Land, off of a fair Village called <HI>Caipha,</HI> at the foot of Mount <HI>Carmel,</HI> they put out white Colours, but in&s;tead of an&s;wering them with the &s;ame Colour, they fired a Volley of &s;mall &s;hot at them, &s;o that they were forced to come back again. The rea&s;on why they an&s;wered not with a white Flag was, that there was a French Merchant in the Village, who came from <HI>Acre</HI> to buy Goods, and he being informed by our <HI>Reys,</HI> that there were French Pa&s;&s;engers on board of that Bark, he went to him that Commanded in the Village, telling him that if he put out a white Flag, they would &s;et us a&s;hoar, and carry off the Bark and Goods, whereas if he did it not, they would be obliged to let both Bark and Men go, not knowing what to do with us: It happened &s;o, indeed, for the Captain finding him&s;elf in great Perplexity, and not knowing what to re&s;olve upon, made us give a Certificate under our Hands, atte&s;ting that the Goods belonged to Frenchmen. When we had &s;ign|ed this, he let us go in our Bark, giving us three <HI>Greeks,</HI> whom he had taken before he met with us. We left him about Noon, and came to <HI>Acre</HI> about an hour after, being every way in bad Equipage, and much out of Order, not having &s;o much as a <HI>Caique</HI> to come a&s;hoar in. <HI>Mon&s;ieur de Bricard,</HI> the French Con&s;ul, &s;ent us one, and did me the favour to offer me both Money and Cloaths, for I had lo&s;t both Cloaths, Money and all, except a Bill of Exchange for <HI>Acre,</HI> which by good luck they left me in an old Cloak-bag, having torn and thrown overboard &s;ome Papers, wherein I had written my Ob&s;ervations of <HI>Jeru&s;alem.</HI> All our Relicks were broken, mi&s;laid, or thrown into the Sea, and the Gourd that I had filled with the Water of <HI>Jordan</HI> was emptied, and then filled with Wine; for when I asked them news of it, they &s;hewed it me full of the Wine, which they had taken from us. So &s;oon as we came a&s;hoar, the Ba&s;ha fitted out four French-Merchants Ships, that were in the Harbour, to fall upon that Cor&s;eir, for they had &s;een us taken from thence; and all the French Merchants knew their own Bark, having a Sail &s;triped with Blew. He put an hundred Turks on board every one of the&s;e Ships, but the Con&s;ul (whom it would have troubled to have &s;een &s;o many Frenchmen made Slaves) having recommended the matter to the Prayers of the Monks, ordered the Captains of the&s;e Ships, to u&s;e all means they could not to take him, and prayed me to di&s;hearten the Turks that went on board; which I did the be&s;t way I could. For the Turks having asked me before they went, what number of Men they were? I told them they were betwixt three and four hundred, though they were not &s;ix&s;core; and that they were well Armed, and re&s;olved to defend them&s;elves to the la&s;t. In &s;hort, the Ba&s;ha him&s;elf went on board one of the four Ships, and made towards the Cor&s;eir, who was lying at Anchor much about the place where he had taken us. He had a de&s;ign (as we were &s;ince informed) thinking them to have been French Merchantmen, to have met them, and got Provi&s;ions from them, (for they were all ready to &s;tarve) and if the Ba&s;ha had had the skill to have put out French Colours, he might have taken them without &s;triking a blow; but the Captains not &s;teering right upon them, and firing purpo&s;ely at them at a di&s;tance, made them know that they were coming to take them, wherefore they quickly cut their Cable, and getting un|der Sail, &s;tood pre&s;ently away; and the Ba&s;ha being very well &s;atisfied that he had made them leave his Coa&s;t, returned to <HI>Acre.</HI></P>

This Town depends on the Ba&s;ha of <HI>Sephet.</HI> Hi&s;tory mentions, that heretofore there were as many Churches in this Town as there are days in the Year; at pre&s;ent there are only the Ruines of about thirty to be &s;een; among others there are &s;ome &s;tately remains of one, where (as they &s;ay) the Knights of <HI>Malta</HI> heretofore had a Trea&s;ure, which they marked with a piece of Marble, and which, not many Years &s;ince, they brought away in a Ship that came purpo&s;ely to <HI>Acre,</HI> under pretext of buy|ing Goods. The Palace of the Great Ma&s;ter is to be &s;een there &s;till, but very Ruinous; there is in this Palace a back Gate towards the Sea, by which the Knights abandoned the Town, and went on Shipboard, when they could no longer defend the place. There remain &s;till a fair Stair-ca&s;e, and &s;ome Build|ings, made there by the <HI>Emir Farr Eddin,</HI> with &s;everal other very lovely Ruines. There is al&s;o a &s;quare Tower in <HI>Acre,</HI> which &s;erves for a Ca&s;tle, with a Hou&s;e clo&s;e by it that &s;erves for a <HI>Serraglio</HI> to the Ba&s;ha, when he is in that Town, which is not much Inhabited, for there are not fifty Hou&s;es in it, and the&s;e too rather Huts than Hou&s;es: Neverthele&s;s there is a little <HI>Han</HI> there, where the French Company of <HI>Sayde</HI> lodged at that time, but they were &s;o &s;treightned in it, that there were no fewer than four of them in one Room.

But the French being informed of this, &s;tood upon their Guard, &s;o that the <HI>Arab</HI> finding his de&s;ign blow'd upon, dur&s;t not undertake it. In &s;hort, this Man of <HI>Sayde</HI> being now at his Wit&s;end, threatned to Plunder their Ware|hou&s;es, which were full of Goods at <HI>Sayde,</HI> if they did not return; but that did not at all move them, as knowing he would have a care how he did that, for he would have been forced to re&s;tore all back again one day, and if they had thought fit, more than he had taken, by pretending that there was ten times as much in them as indeed there was: But at length, &s;ome Months after, the Con&s;ul and Nation having received all Satisfaction from <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> re|turned in Triumph to <HI>Sayde.</HI></P>

<P>THE fir&s;t thing that may be &s;een at <HI>Dama&s;cus,</HI> is the <HI>Beze&s;tein,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Dama&s;cus.</NOTE> which is Beautiful enough, and hath three Gates; from whence you go to the Ca&s;tle, which is all built of Stones cut in Diamond cut; but it is not ea&s;ie for Franks to enter it. At fir&s;t you come to a Court of Guard with &s;everal Arms hanging upon the Wall, and two pieces of Ordnance, each &s;ixteen &s;pans long. About fifteen &s;teps further is the Mint, where the Jews Work. A little beyond that, there is a Dome of no great Workman&s;hip, but &s;upported by four &s;o great Pillars, that three men can hardly fathom one of them round. Fifty paces from thence, you enter through a large Arched Hall into the Divan where the Council is held, painted with Gold and Azure after the Mo&s;aick way; and in it there are three Ba&s;ons full of excellent water: When you come out of the Ca&s;tle, you &s;ee the Ditches half a Pikes depth, and twenty paces over, wherein on the &s;ide of the Town a little Canal of water runs, which waters the Gardens about, that are full of Orange, Limon, Pomgranet, and &s;everal other Trees. Through the middle of the Ca&s;tle runs a branch of the River, with which they can fill the Ditches, when there is occa&s;ion. On the out&s;ide of the Walls of the &s;ame Ca&s;tle, hang two Chains of Stone, one of which contains &s;ixteen Links, and the other fourteen, cut one within another by matchle&s;s Art, each Link being about two fathom long, and one and a half wide, and the two Chains are of one entire Stone a piece, From thence you come to a fair Mo&s;que about twenty Paces Square, painted all over with Mo&s;aick work in Gold and Azure, and paved with Marble;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Melec Daer.</NOTE> in the middle of it is the Sepulchre of <HI>Melec Daer,</HI> Sultan of <HI>Aegypt.</HI> After that, you mu&s;t &s;ee the Hou&s;e of the <HI>Tefterdar,</HI> wherein there is a little Marble Mo&s;que of mo&s;t lovely Archi|tecture, and painted with Gold and Azure. There are &s;everal lovely Rooms in it of the &s;ame fa&s;hion, at each Window whereof, you have a little Fountain of mo&s;t clear Water, which is artificially brought thither in Pipes. In this Hou&s;e there is a door and &s;everal great Windows, with copper-Lettices which look into the great Mo&s;que, and thence one may &s;ee without mole&s;tation, but Chri&s;tians are forbidden to enter it, upon pain of Death, or turning Turk. From that door and the Windows, one may perceive a great part of the Mo&s;que which may be about three hundred paces long, and three&s;core wide. The
<PB N="218" REF="129">
Court is paved with lovely Stones, mo&s;t part of Marble, &s;hining like Lookin-gla&s;&s;es. Round about this Court there are &s;everal Pillars of Marble, porphy|rie and Ja&s;per, incomparably well wrought, which &s;upport an Arch that ranges all round, painted with &s;everal pieces in Mo&s;aick work. The Porch of the Mo&s;que faces this Court, and the entry into it is by twelve large Copper-Doors embo&s;&s;ed with Figures, with &s;everal Pillars, mo&s;t part of Porphyrie, who&s;e Capitals are gilt. The walls are painted with lovely figures in Gold and Azure. The Turks them&s;elves have &s;o great a veneration for this place, that they dare not pa&s;s through the Court without taking off their Pabouches; and certainly 'tis one of the lovelie&s;t Mo&s;ques in all the Turki&s;h Empire. It was heretofore a Chri&s;tian Church, built by the Emperour <HI>Heraclius,</HI> in Honour of St. <HI>Zacha|rias,</HI> the Father of St. <HI>John</HI> Bapti&s;t, and they &s;ay, there is a Sepulchre in it where the Bones of that holy Prophet re&s;t. You mu&s;t al&s;o &s;ee the Fountain where St. <HI>Paul</HI> recovered his &s;ight, and was Baptized by <HI>Ananias,</HI> which is in the <HI>Streight-&s;treet,</HI> &s;o called in the Acts of the Apo&s;tles, under a Vault in the <HI>Bazar,</HI> near to a thick Pillar, called the Ancient Pillar; then you go up to the Hou&s;e of that &s;ame <HI>Judas,</HI> with whom St. <HI>Paul</HI> Sojourned, to be in&s;tructed in the Chri&s;tian Religion, and Baptized: there you &s;ee a great door armed with Iron and huge Nails; within which is the Chamber where the &s;aid Saint Fa&s;ted three Days and three Nights. After that, you go out of the Town by a Gate called <HI>Bab cherki,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Bab Cherki.</NOTE> That is to &s;ay, Ea&s;t Gate, near to which (in former times) there was a great Church, built in honour of St. <HI>Paul,</HI> but at pre&s;ent the Turks have made a <HI>Han</HI> of it; the Steeple remains &s;till, and is very ancient Work. Continuing your way along the Town-Ditches, and about fifty paces Southward, from the &s;aid gate, you &s;ee a great &s;quare Tower joining to the walls, in the middle of which there are two Flowers de luce cut in Relief, and well &s;haped, and at the &s;ide of each of them a Lyon cut in the &s;ame manner: Betwixt the&s;e <HI>Flowers de Luce,</HI> there is a great Stone with an In&s;cription upon it in Turki&s;h Characters. About three hundred paces further, you come to the Gate called <HI>Bab K&s;&s;a,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Bab K&s;&s;a.</NOTE> that is walled up, under which is the place where St. <HI>Paul</HI> was let down in a Basket, to avoid the per&s;ecution of the Jews.

This Village which was formerly a Town, &s;tands at the foot of Mount <HI>Carmel;</HI> we went up the Mount, and about &s;even a Clock came to the Convent, which is held by barefooted <HI>Carmelites.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Convent on Mount <HI>Carmel.</HI></NOTE> There we found two French Fathers and an Italian Brother, who had been twenty years there. They ob&s;erve a very &s;evere Rule, for be&s;ide that they are removed from all Worldly Conver&s;ation, they neither eat Fle&s;h nor drink Wine, and if they need it, they mu&s;t go to another place, as the Superiour at that time did, for being a&s;thmatick, and pining away daily, he was forced to go to <HI>Acre,</HI> there to recruit him&s;elf for &s;ome days: Nor do they &s;uffer Pilgrims to eat Fle&s;h in their Convent, only they allow them to drink Wine. This Convent is not on the top of the Mount, where they had a lovely one, before the Chri&s;tians lo&s;t the Holy Land, the ruines whereof are &s;till to be &s;een; but is a very little one &s;omewhat lower, and needs no more but three Monks to fill it, who would have much adoe to &s;ub&s;i&s;t, if they had not &s;ome Alms given them by the French Merchants of <HI>Acre,</HI> that go often thither to their Devoti|ons. They have po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed this place thirty years, &s;ince the time they were driven out of it, after that the Chri&s;tians lo&s;t the Holy Land; it is the place where the Prophet <HI>Elias</HI> lived, and their Church is the very Grott where &s;ometimes he abode, which is very neatly cut out of the Rock: From this Con|vent they have an excellent Pro&s;pect, e&s;pecially upon the Sea, where there is no bounds to their &s;ight. About their Convent they have a pretty Hermitage very well Cultivated by the Italian Brother, who hath brought all the Earth that is in it thither; and indeed, it is very plea&s;ant to &s;ee Flowers and Fruits growing upon a Hill that is nothing but Rock. The&s;e good Monks gave us a very neat Collation of nine or ten Di&s;hes of Fruit, and then we went to re&s;t in the apartment of the Pilgrims; for though it be a very little place, yet they have made a &s;mall, commodious and very neat Lodging for Pilgrims, but they mu&s;t not exceed the number of &s;ix. Next day the fourteenth of <HI>May,</HI> we

There are al&s;o many other long and round pieces of Marble built in the Wall, in&s;cribed with Greek Characters, and very artfully engraven with Ro&s;es and other Figures. St. <HI>Helen</HI> built that Church, which was long po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the Chri&s;tians of the Countrey, but, at length, about an hundred and &s;ixty years ago, was u&s;urped by the Turks, and &s;erves them at pre&s;ent for their chief Mo&s;que; the Roof that is &s;upported by the&s;e Pillars, has been lately renewed, and is only of Wood ill put together.

At the door of this Mo&s;que, there are two Marble-Pillars twenty &s;pan long, lying along upon the Ground. From thence, you go to another Church held by the Moors, called St. <HI>George</HI>'s; the Chri&s;tians of the Country may perform their Devotions there, paying for half the Oyl that is con&s;umed in it.

Ours had twelve Oars on each &s;ide; but be&s;ides, it had a great Ma&s;t with a very large Sail; &s;o that being light Loaded, no Galley could be too hard for one of them, if their Oars were long enough, but they have them very &s;hort.

much &s;urpri&s;ed us, but more when we &s;aw that they made great Fires all along the Coa&s;t, and e&s;pecially upon the Towers. We knew not the cau&s;e of this, (which I &s;hall tell hereafter) only we concluded that they took us for Pirats. When we came near to <HI>Jaffa,</HI> we perceived a great Fire upon the Tower, and then about nine a Clock at Night, offering to put into the Harbour to take in Wood and Water, they fired at us both great and &s;mall Shot: Then our <HI>Reys</HI> went upon the Poop, and called out as loud as he could, that he was &s;uch a Man, <HI>Reys</HI> of a <HI>Sanbiquer,</HI> calling by Name tho&s;e whom he knew at <HI>Jaffa;</HI> but we had no other an&s;wer from within but <HI>Alarga,</HI> that is to &s;ay, that we &s;hould &s;tand off, and with that another Volley of great and &s;mall Shot: When this Mu&s;ick had la&s;ted about an Hour, they continually Firing, and our <HI>Reys</HI> calling to them and making a heavy Noi&s;e, the other <HI>Sanbiquer</HI> &s;tood in nearer than we, and the <HI>Reys</HI> calling as loud as ever he could, made them at length hear him, and the Greeks who were at <HI>Jaffa</HI> to know him: Then in &s;tead of <HI>Alarga,</HI> they called to us <HI>Taala,</HI> which exceedingly rejoyced us; and the meaning of that was, that we &s;hould come in, &s;o that we entered the Port about ten a Clock at Night. For my part, I was afraid it might have been a Trick, that &s;o they might have ea&s;ily &s;unk us when we were got nearer. But it proved other|wi&s;e, for we were received as Friends. We found all the People in Arms, ready to flie, and the Women and Children were already gone from <HI>Jaffa.</HI> Here we had the comfort to be pittied, that we &s;hould have been Rifled even by Chri&s;tians, for they knew us as having been once before at <HI>Jaffa,</HI> and had had intelligence of our being taken. We &s;tayed at <HI>Jaffa</HI> for fair Weather until <HI>Friday,</HI> the four and twentieth of <HI>May,</HI> when the Wind pre&s;enting, we &s;et out about Noon, and within two or three Hours after, were got out of &s;ight of Land; the Wind calming in the Evening, we came to an Anchor, and next Morning, <HI>Saturday</HI> the five and twentieth of <HI>May,</HI> by break of day we weigh|ed, and &s;ailed upon a Wind; about three or four a Clock in the Afternoon we made Land, and &s;tanding in to it, came to an Anchor at Sun-&s;etting, not being able to weather a Cape on head of us, becau&s;e the Wind was contrary. Next day being <HI>Sunday,</HI> the &s;ix and twentieth of <HI>May,</HI> we weighed by break of day, and pre&s;ently made two Sail, whereof the one &s;eemed to be a Ship, and the other a Galliot; we rowed off from them as much as we could, and at length (after &s;ome hours) lo&s;t &s;ight of them, but about Noon again we &s;aw the Galliot a &s;tern of us. Our Con&s;ort ran pre&s;ently a&s;hoar, and in&s;tead of doing the like, we rowed and made all the &s;ail we could, &s;o that in a &s;hort time we lo&s;t &s;ight of the Galliot once more; but making her again a little af|ter, we rowed again a little, and &s;o lo&s;t &s;ight of her the third time. At fir&s;t when we made tho&s;e Sails, my mind mi&s;gave me that &s;ome Misfortune attended us; and indeed I was an unlucky Prophet, for I told the re&s;t, that as yet we were too far from <HI>Damiette</HI> to be taken, and that as we had been already taken within ten Miles of <HI>Acre,</HI> &s;o we &s;hould be taken within ten Miles of <HI>Da|miette.</HI> Having then lo&s;t &s;ight of that Galliot once more, about &s;ix a Clock at Night we came to an Anchor at a place, from whence we could &s;ee three Ve&s;&s;els riding at an Anchor al&s;o. Our de&s;ign was, &s;o &s;oon as it &s;hould be Night and calm, to endeavour to double a point of Land that we were not far &s;hort of, and then we would have been pretty near <HI>Damiette,</HI> and avoided that which befel us, but our Company &s;lept too long; for <HI>Monday,</HI> the &s;even and twentieth of <HI>May,</HI> they turned out about two hours before day, and having weighed Anchor, made all the way they could with Sails and Oars, but at break of day when we were not twenty miles from <HI>Damiette,</HI> we &s;aw two <HI>Cayques</HI> full of Men coming again&s;t us; then would our Company have &s;tood back again, but it was too late. And the <HI>Cayques</HI> making up with all &s;peed, a Turk who was a Pa&s;&s;enger with us, tied his bundle about his Neck, and jump|ing over-board, got quickly a&s;hoar without the lo&s;s of any thing; the re&s;t, whether it was that they could not Swim &s;o well, or that they hoped we might gain &s;hoar before they could board us, did not imitate him. I had then &s;ome apprehen&s;ions, that they as well as the Cor&s;airs, might di&s;charge their choler upon us who were Franks. But at length the <HI>Cayques</HI> being come within Mu&s;|quet-&s;hot of us, all the Turks who were Pa&s;&s;engers in our <HI>Sanbiquer,</HI> leaped over-board to &s;ave them&s;elves on &s;hoar, and the Greeks having fired the two

Pre&s;ently one of the Caiques fired a Cros-bar Shot out of a Blunderbu&s;s into our Poop,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cor&s;airs that were Franks.</NOTE> which had it hit but a hands breadth lower, would have killed us all, and &s;unk the Sanbiquer to rights; but &s;eeing no body appear on board of us, they made after tho&s;e who were making their e&s;cape to &s;hoar, for being near land, the water was very &s;hallow, which made the Soldiers (finding ground) to jump into the Sea, with a Sword in one hand and a Pi&s;tol in the other, and pur&s;ue the poor Wretches, firing at tho&s;e whom they could not overtake: In the <HI>interim,</HI> I prayed our Capucin and another French Monk that was with us, to go up upon the Deck, and put out a white Flag, which they did; and putting up a Handkerchief upon the end of a &s;tick, called in French to tho&s;e who remained in the Caiques, that we were French; they bid us lower our Sail, which we ea&s;ily did, but it was &s;o great that we could not furl it. In the mean time, it covered all our Sanbiquer, and they fearing there might be more &s;till hid underneath, dur&s;t not come; but having told them, that with|out their a&s;&s;i&s;tance they could not furl it, and that they need not fear any thing, they came on board, where knowing us to be Franks, they offered us not the lea&s;t injury as the former had done, only took of our baggage and things what they found here and there in the Ve&s;&s;el, though we our&s;elves kept &s;till a good &s;hare of them.</P>

When they were come on board our Sanbiquir, they &s;earch'd in all places to &s;ee if they could find any thing worth the taking, and made Captive &s;even Turks in all: Being all on board our San|biquer or in their own Caiques, they carried us to their Ships; and by the way, told us, how they had made us the evening before, but that not having &s;een a Galliot which they had in company, for two days, they took our Sanbiquer for her, till next morning, when we &s;tood clo&s;e in by the &s;hoar, they were con|vinced it was not &s;he, and that if they had not taken us for their Galliot, they would have given us a vi&s;ite the &s;ame evening that they &s;aw us.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. LXIII.</HI> Of what happened on Board the Cor&s;airs &s;o long as we were with them, and our Arrival at <HI>Damiette.</HI></HEAD>
<P>WIthin an hour, we came on board the Cor&s;airs, being two Ships, the one Commanded by Captain <HI>Santi,</HI> called otherwi&s;e <HI>Ripuerto</HI> of <HI>Legorn,</HI> and the other by Captain <HI>Nicolo</HI> of <HI>Zante.</HI> We were made very welcome by the&s;e Captains, who divided us betwixt them: Our Monks went on board of Cap|tain <HI>Santi,</HI> and we who were Seculars were taken into the Ship of Captain <HI>Nicolo.</HI> The&s;e two Ships were Con&s;orts, and had on board each an hundred and forty Men, with fourteen Oars a&s;ide, which they could u&s;e in ca&s;e of nece&s;|&s;ity, &s;etting two Men to each Oar. The Ship we were in had four and twenty Petreras, and two great Guns all of Bra&s;s, be&s;ides a great number of Muskets and Blunderbu&s;&s;es; and the other was as well armed: They had be&s;ides a Galliot which they had made of a Sanbiquer they had taken near to <HI>Scandaroon,</HI> and armed with &s;ix brazen Petreras, and a fair bra&s;s cha&s;e-Gun, having manned her with eighty of their Men, forty a piece, and that was the &s;ame Galliot which had given us the cha&s;e the day before: One of the&s;e Cor&s;airs had been &s;ix and thirty, and the other forty Months out at Sea.</P>
<P><PB N="227" REF="133">I wondred to &s;ee on board the Ship where we were, &s;everal Slaves, Men, Women and Children, and they told me that they had taken mo&s;t of them at <HI>Ca&s;tel Peregrino</HI> &s;ome days before, having &s;urpri&s;ed the Ca&s;tle in this manner. When they had took this Sanbiquer, which (as I &s;aid) they turned into a Galliot, a Turk about <HI>Scandaroon</HI> who was taken in her, made a Propo&s;al to them, that if they would give him his liberty, he would put them in a way of taking many Slaves: They pre&s;ently made him a Promi&s;e, but he not tru&s;ting to their Word (for all he was a Turk) made them Swear it before an Image of our Ble&s;&s;ed Lady, and another of St. <HI>Francis.</HI> When they had given their Oath, he made them &s;teer their cour&s;e toward <HI>Ca&s;tel Peregrino,</HI> which is a pitiful little open Ca&s;tle betwixt <HI>Acre</HI> and <HI>Jaffa,</HI> ten miles below Mount <HI>Carmel,</HI> on the way to <HI>Jaffa.</HI> They took their mea&s;ures &s;o well, that they were not at all perceived, and having immediately landed, they went without any noi&s;e to the Habitation, where being come, they began to appear in their Colours,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Surpri|&s;al of an Ha|bitation by Italian Cor|&s;airs.</NOTE> carry|ing away all living Creatures, Men, Women and Children, and killing all, without regard to Age or Sex, that would not willingly go along with them; in&s;omuch that &s;ome Soldiers told me, that they had killed young Maids, who notwith&s;tanding they had &s;een others that would not follow, killed before their faces, cho&s;e rather to be put to Death, than to be made Slaves. They &s;hewed me one of their Officers, to whom a Soldier brought a Child four months old, telling him, Here is a Slave for you; who in a barbarous manner taking the innocent Infant by one foot, and &s;aying, What would you have me to do with this, threw it from him (as if it had been a &s;tone) as far as he could on the ground. They made on this occa&s;ion above fifty Slaves, Men, Women and Children.</P>
<P>The Turk who was their Guide, having brought them on board, they took off his Chain, and he went to look for more, never thinking of making his e&s;cape, either becau&s;e he tru&s;ted to their Oath, or el&s;e perhaps, becau&s;e he was afraid to have met in that Countrey with the reward of his Treachery. They killed more than they took, and left not &s;o much as a living Soul in the place; and that was the cau&s;e of the great allarm they were put into on that Coa&s;t, when we &s;ailed along it from <HI>Acre</HI> to <HI>Jaffa.</HI></P>
<P>It was a &s;ad &s;pectacle to &s;ee on board this Ship &s;o many poor Women, with their Children at their brea&s;ts, having no greater allowance than a little mouldy Bisket and two gla&s;&s;es of &s;tinking Water a day, which was all the Men had al&s;o; but among others, there was one Woman Slave on board, with her Husband, Brother, &s;even Children, and one in her Womb: All this together cau&s;ed a great clutter and na&s;tine&s;s in the Ship; nay, there was one little Child ill of the Small-pox, which made me afraid of catching the &s;ame Di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>We were no better treated than the Slaves,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Entertain|ment on board the Cor&s;airs.</NOTE> for they were in great want of Provi&s;ions, and had &s;o little Water, that they were obliged to di&s;tribute it by mea&s;ure, giving every one two gla&s;&s;es a day. Our Diet then, con&s;i&s;ted of two meals a day, both alike, one at noon, and the other at night, and the&s;e were a little mouldy Bisket of all colours, which, to &s;ea&s;on and &s;often it, was &s;teep'd in Water that &s;tunck &s;o horridly, that it &s;melt all over the Cabin, and getting into our throat as we broke the Bisket with our teeth, was like to have turned our &s;tomacks: A little Chee&s;e we had al&s;o that might have kept along time, for it needed a Hatchet to cut it: Our Drink was the &s;ame &s;tinking Water, with a very little coat of Wine upon it; and in the night-time we lay upon the deck, amid&s;t the Vermine and filth of the poor Wretches; our Monks were better accommodated, as they told us afterwards. However I was not alto|gether di&s;heartned by this adver&s;ity, on the contrary, was fain to encourage the re&s;t, who thought them&s;elves half dead already, and apply'd my &s;elf to con&s;ider what way we might be delivered out of this mi&s;ery. With their two Ships they had a great Saique, which they had taken a few days before, and &s;ome Greeks coming to redeem her, had offered a thou&s;and Pia&s;tres for her; but the&s;e Gentlemen demanding fifteen hundred, the Greeks went away, promi&s;ing however to come back again; which I having under&s;tood from the Captain (who was as willing to be rid of us as we were to be gone, becau&s;e we le&s;&s;ened his &s;tinking Provi&s;ions,) we prepared to go to <HI>Damiette</HI> with them: The Cor&s;airs would willingly have &s;et us a&s;hoar, if we had plea&s;ed, but we would by no
<PB N="228" REF="134">
means accept of that offer, for fear of having been taken for Cor&s;airs, and &s;o immediately burnt alive; and it was too fre&s;h in my memory what I had been told of other Franks, who having e&s;caped from Shipwreck, and coming a-&s;hore, thought they came very well off when they were only made Slaves. In the mean time, the Galliot came up with the Ships, <HI>Tue&s;day</HI> morning, the eight and twentieth of <HI>May;</HI> &s;he had taken a Saycot, which was the &s;ail we had &s;een with her, but &s;he let it go, as not worth their while to &s;tay for it.</P>
<P>On <HI>Wedne&s;day</HI> the nine and twentieth of <HI>May,</HI> about an hour before day, a Polaque fell in among us, and running foul of our Sanbiquer that was towed at the &s;tern of one of the Ships, made a hole in her &s;ide: The Cor&s;airs were immiediately allarmed, and firing &s;ome &s;mall Shot into the Polaque, manned their Boats to take her. On the other hand, tho&s;e on board the Polaque, who were either drunk or a&s;leep, awaking at the knock which their Polaque gave in &s;triking again&s;t the Sanbiquer, and being &s;en&s;ible of their fault, betook them|&s;elves in all ha&s;te to their Caique, and endeavoured to make their e&s;cape by rowing, but being clo&s;ely pur&s;ued, they were &s;oon come up with, and of one and twenty Turks that were in it, twelve leaped into the Sea to &s;wim, though the neare&s;t land was above &s;ix miles off, and the nine that remained, were brought on board the Ship: I asked them how they came to be &s;o neg|ligent in looking after their Ve&s;&s;el, and they told me, that thinking them&s;elves to have been near the mouth of the <HI>Nile</HI> before <HI>Damiette,</HI> they were fallen a&s;leep, which was the wor&s;t excu&s;e they could have made, &s;eeing they ought to have been afraid that their Polaque might have run a-ground. There were &s;ome Bales of Soap in that Polaque.</P>
<P>The &s;ame day, the Cor&s;airs finding that the Greeks (to whom the Saique that they had taken belonged,) came not again, re&s;olved to burn her; but know|ing that the more mi&s;chief they did, the harder it would be for us to get a-&s;hore, I prayed the Captain not to burn her, and at my reque&s;t, having taken away all her Sails and Rigging, they let her go a drift, and not long after, we &s;aw her run a-&s;hore. In the &s;ame manner they unrigg'd our Sanbiquer, and having &s;et her a drift al&s;o, &s;he was ca&s;t away in our &s;ight.</P>
<P>After that, we &s;teered our cour&s;e toward <HI>Damiette,</HI> to take in fre&s;h water at the mouth of the <HI>Nile:</HI> This re&s;olution made us greatly rejoyce, for good fre&s;h water would have been (at that time) a great Treat for us, be&s;ides that, being near to the place where we de&s;ired to be, we hoped &s;till to find &s;ome expedient of getting &s;afe a-&s;hore: We &s;tood in as near as we could, and next day, being <HI>Thur&s;day</HI> the thirtieth of <HI>May,</HI> about ten a clock in the morning, we were got before the mouth of the <HI>Nile,</HI> and the Galliot went in to take fre&s;h water, in &s;pight of the Guns of the Fort: Our Ships had a mind to do the like, and put out a white Flag, that they might &s;ee whether they would let us come a-&s;hore, or ran&s;ome any of the Slaves they had on board: We expected with great impatience that they &s;hould have put out a white Flag on the Ca&s;tle, and were making ready to go quickly to <HI>Damiette</HI> with all &s;afety, when (as ill luck would have it) he that look'd out from the main top-ma&s;t head, made four Sail: Immediately they changed their white Flag into a red, though I offered to tell them, that it was ill done to fall foul of tho&s;e Sails, which perhaps, only &s;tood in becau&s;e they had &s;een white Colours abroad; but they made an&s;wer, that &s;eeing the Ca&s;tle had not put out a white Flag, they were no ways obliged; &s;o that they gave cha&s;e to tho&s;e four Ve&s;&s;els, and the Ca&s;tle fired &s;everal Shot at us, without any effect, unle&s;s perhaps they &s;erved to give warning to tho&s;e Saiques to make away as fa&s;t as they could: Three of them made their e&s;cape, and the fourth (wich was a Saycot) run a-&s;hore, and all that were on board, got to land and &s;aved them&s;elves: Our Caiques were manned out, who finding in her nothing but Wood, wherewith &s;he was loaded, and the <HI>Reys</HI> all alone (who was a Greek) they left her there, and him in her, and &s;o came back to the Ships.</P>
<P>Next day, being <HI>Friday</HI> the la&s;t of <HI>May,</HI> having by break of day made a Saique, we gave her the cha&s;e al&s;o till about noon: While we were in pur&s;uit of her, we heard four Guns, and our Cor&s;airs thinking it might be &s;ome other Cor&s;air come upon the Coa&s;t, who was in cha&s;e of &s;ome Saycot, made all the &s;peed they could with Sails and Oars after the Saique; for our parts, our wi&s;hes
<PB N="229" REF="134">
were contrary to theirs, for we always prayed to God, that they might not come up with her; &s;till reckoning, that the le&s;s mi&s;chief they did, the bet|ter it would be for us; however they laboured &s;o hard, that they gained ground on her, and manned out their <HI>Cayque</HI> to Board her; then they who were in the <HI>Sayque,</HI> (finding that they could not make their E&s;cape) &s;urrendred them&s;elves; and another <HI>Saycot</HI> &s;eeing this, though &s;he was above &s;ix miles off of us, came without being pur&s;ued, and Surrendred of her own accord, in hopes of better u&s;age; and both the&s;e two, were only loaded with <HI>Carob</HI> Beans. Towards the Evening, the Galliot, which had been out a Crui&s;ing, (as &s;he daily did) came up with our Ships, and told us that they had met with a Turki&s;h Galliot, and having laid her a thwart the <HI>Ha&s;s,</HI> they met with &s;tout re&s;i&s;tance; the Turks who were on board of her, having a naked Sword between their Teeth, and a Mu&s;quet in their hands; &s;o that finding they could do no good on her that way, they left the Head, and &s;et upon her on the Stern, but they found as hot &s;ervice there, as they had done before, and were even in danger of having been taken by the Turks: They Boarded her again the third time, but could make nothing on't; on the contrary, the Turks were like to have ma&s;tered them; &s;o that having three of their Men Killed, and &s;even wounded, they were fain to come off with Di&s;grace. Du|ring that Engagement, they had fired &s;ome &s;hot with their Cha&s;e-Gun, which were the Guns we had heard in the Morning, and if the Ships had &s;tood that way, from whence they heard the Guns, as the Maximes of their trade requi|red, they would have ea&s;ily taken that Galliot; but being unwilling to &s;ave a certain for an uncertain Booty, they mi&s;&s;ed of that fair hit.</P>
<P>This Engagement afflicted us, becau&s;e it made our condition wor&s;e and wor&s;e, neverthele&s;s, we prayed our Captain to let go that <HI>Saycot,</HI> which had voluntarily &s;urrendred, to the end, that &s;he going to <HI>Damiette,</HI> we might go with her, and that the&s;e men might tell a-&s;hoar, that they had been obliged to us for having begged their <HI>Saycot</HI> for them. This <HI>Saycot</HI> being of &s;mall value, they ea&s;ily granted our de&s;ires, and having taken out of her ten Sacks of <HI>Carobs,</HI> they &s;et us on board and let her go, on <HI>Saturday</HI> the fir&s;t of <HI>June.</HI> We entreated the Captain al&s;o to give us that Turk who had put them upon the exploit of <HI>Ca&s;tel Peregrino;</HI> for &s;eeing they had promi&s;ed him his Liberty, before an Image of the Virgin, as their Soldiers told us, he might tell all People at <HI>Damiette,</HI> that we had procured him his freedom; not daring to tell the real cau&s;e of it, and &s;o would have put us out of all danger; but they made us an&s;wer, that they would carry him back to his own Countrey; which made &s;ome of the Soldiers murmur a little, &s;aying they could not fail of falling into &s;ome mi&s;chance, &s;eeing they fal&s;ified their Promi&s;e made before the Image of the Ble&s;&s;ed Virgin. We went then in that <HI>Saycot</HI> which came from <HI>Cyprus,</HI> and was bound for <HI>Damiette,</HI> and were not as yet out of dan|ger; for if the&s;e Greeks had been malicious Rogues, they might have taken an opportunity to throw us over Board; not only to make them&s;elves &s;atisfaction for the &s;mall matter that was taken from them, by the little Goods we had, but al&s;o in revenge of the wrongs which the Franks daily do to the Greeks their Countrey men; and indeed, we took that re&s;olution only that we might be delivered out of the mi&s;eries that we endured a Board of the&s;e Ships; for be&s;ides the bad entertainment we had there, (which we could not have born with much longer,) we were daily in danger of being taken and burn'd a live, or at lea&s;t made Slaves if the&s;e Cor&s;airs had been taken; as indeed it was to me a great wonder, that the Turks &s;hould &s;uffer the&s;e Blades to &s;top the entry into <HI>Damiette,</HI> &s;eeing they needed do no more but man out five or &s;ix good <HI>Sayques,</HI> with an hundred and fifty or two hundred men a piece, and fall upon the&s;e Cor&s;airs, whom they might ea&s;ily have taken. Be&s;ides that, we were hourly in danger of being wounded, if the Ships came to an Engage|ment, and dur&s;t not defend our &s;elves, for if we had once taken Arms, we mu&s;t have laid a&s;ide all thoughts of &s;etting Foot on Turki&s;h Ground, where we might be known by one or other that had E&s;caped, or been Ran&s;om'd out of the hands of the Cor&s;airs. In reality, the life of a Cor&s;air is a mo&s;t wretched life, both for this World and the next; and certainly, there is nothing but I could do, rather than be engaged in it. When we left our
<PB N="230" REF="135">
Cor&s;airs, we were fifteen miles from <HI>Damiette,</HI> where we arrived in three hours time; and &s;o &s;oon as we came to the place where the water of the <HI>Nile</HI> mingles with the Sea, which is a good mile out at Sea from the mouth of the River, for the different colours of the River-water and Sea-water may ea&s;ily be &s;een. There came out &s;ome <HI>Germes</HI> to unload our <HI>Saycot,</HI> becau&s;e at this place, loaded Ve&s;&s;els cannot come in, for want of Water. The&s;e <HI>Germes</HI> are great Boats with high &s;ides and very light; they are Lighters open fore and aft, having no Deck, that they may take in the more Goods. They came about us in &s;uch numbers, every one &s;triving to be the fir&s;t, that &s;ome of them were like to have run down our <HI>Saycot.</HI> When they had light|tened us a little, and we were got into the mouth of the <HI>Nile,</HI> we took our Goods in again out of the <HI>Germes,</HI> and in half an hours time, went up the River to <HI>Damiette,</HI> about two miles from the mouth of it. For defence of this entry, there is only a &s;orry tower, in form of a Ca&s;tle, wherein are &s;ome Guns mounted, which were tho&s;e that Fired at the Cor&s;airs. Being upon the <HI>Nile,</HI> we drank our Bellies full of good Water, thinking our &s;elves to be come out of Hell into Paradice, as we came from Sea into a River; however we were &s;till fearful of going a-&s;hoar at <HI>Damiette;</HI> where being come, we quickly di&s;patched a Monk to find out the Hou&s;e of a French Man whom we knew to be there, the danger not being &s;o great for a Religious Per&s;on, as for us: He &s;peedily came back to us again, and having given &s;ome Crowns which we had &s;aved from the Cor&s;airs, to the Greeks of the <HI>Saycot,</HI> for they would needs be paid for our Pa&s;&s;age, and that at a dear rate too, without calling to mind that we had begg'd their <HI>Saycot</HI> for them. We &s;tep'd a-&s;hoar over the Galliot which had been the day before attacked by our Cor&s;airs. We went to that French Merchants Hou&s;e, who made us very welcome, and told us, that that Galliot came from <HI>Satabia,</HI> and that they on Board were three hundred Men, having with them fifteen thou&s;and <HI>Pia&s;tres,</HI> wherewith they were going to Trafick at <HI>Mecha,</HI> and that they had had one Man Killed, and three Wounded. Had our Cor&s;airs minded their bu&s;ine&s;s as they &s;hould, they would have enriched them&s;elves, for all the&s;e Turks were well Cloathed, and able to pay Ran&s;oms, being all Rich; after we had re&s;ted our &s;elves a little, we went to the Bi&s;hop of the Greeks, to acquaint him with our Di&s;a&s;ter, and to de&s;ire his Protection and Certificate, that we were not Cor&s;airs. Afterward we kept very private within doors, but the People of the Countrey were &s;o far from abu&s;ing us, that they pitied our misfortune, and three Turks came to &s;ee us, and told us that they were of tho&s;e that were on Board that <HI>Polaque,</HI> which ran foul of our <HI>Sanbiquer</HI> in the night-time, and had &s;wam a-&s;hoar. They asked us news of their Comrades that were made Slaves; and we de&s;ired to know of them what was become of the other nine, who jump'd into the Sea with them, but they told us that they could not tell what was become of them, they were certainly Drowned; and indeed, it requires a very good Heart to &s;wim above two Leagues. We had no &s;ight of <HI>Damiette,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Damiette.</NOTE> but upon our Arrival, not daring to walk abroad in the Streets; all we could ob&s;erve was, that it is a very hand&s;ome well built long Town, yet not &s;o long as <HI>Ro&s;&s;etto.</HI> It was anciently called <HI>Pelu&s;ium,</HI> and lyes upon a Branch of the River of <HI>Nile,</HI> which di&s;charges it &s;elf into the Sea, two miles below this Town, that makes one Angle of the <HI>Delta.</HI></P>

<P>THE publication of the wonderful growth of the <HI>Nile,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The growth of the <HI>Nile.</HI></NOTE> begins to be made on St. <HI>Peter</HI> and St. <HI>Paul</HI>'s day, or the day before, that is to &s;ay, the eight and twentieth, or nine and twentieth day of <HI>June,</HI> and though that River begin almo&s;t always to encrea&s;e from the &s;ixteenth or twentieth day of <HI>May,</HI> yet they publi&s;h it not before one of the days aforementioned, when it is already pretty well encrea&s;ed; that is to &s;ay, betwixt &s;ix and a half, and eight <HI>Pics.</HI> The <HI>Pic</HI> is a Mea&s;ure of twenty four fingers breadth. The Year before, the day when they begin to cry the growth of the <HI>Nile,</HI> it had encrea&s;ed &s;even <HI>Pics</HI> and a half, according to what the Criers &s;aid; who neverthele&s;s, though the <HI>Nile</HI> encrea&s;es &s;even, eight, or ten fingers a day, yet they never cry com|monly more than two, three, or four, according as they agree about it among them&s;elves, and keep the overplus till towards the end, when the Bank is near to be cut: They then add every day part of that which they have re&s;erved to the real growth of that day they cry it on; and though it have not encrea&s;ed above five or &s;ix fingers breadth, they'll cry that it is ri&s;en 23 or 24 fingers, to the end they may make the People joyful with the hopes of a good Year, and gain the more to them&s;elves; &s;o that at the end, their account is always ju&s;t. They have another rea&s;on al&s;o why they re&s;erve &s;ome fingers till the

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. LXVI.</HI> Of the Ceremonies and Publick Rejoycings at the Opening of the <HI>Khalis.</HI></HEAD>
<P><HI>WEdne&s;day</HI> the fourteenth of <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ceremonies and publick rejoycings at the opening of the <HI>Khalis.</HI></NOTE> he that daily mea&s;ures the encrea&s;e of the <HI>Nile,</HI> receives a <HI>Caftan</HI> from the Ba&s;ha, becau&s;e the Water was ri&s;en 16. <HI>Pics;</HI> and <HI>Thur&s;day</HI> the fifteenth of <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> we went to <HI>Boulac,</HI> to &s;ee the preparations that were making for the cutting of the <HI>Khalis;</HI> there we &s;aw all the <HI>Acabas</HI> ranked in order. <HI>Acaba,</HI> they call great Barges or Barks,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Acaba.</NOTE> in the &s;tern whereof they make a Hall or Divan of Timber, Painted, Gilt, and contrived like the Rooms of their Hou&s;es. This Hall may be fourteen or fifteen good Paces broad, and about the &s;ame in length, with Rails and Bali&s;ters of Joyners Work all round them; all this is Gilt, and full of Arabick Chara|cters in Gold, and within they have &s;everal lovely Carpets and Cu&s;hions, after their way, Embroidered with Gold, and a Lanthorn; but in the Ba&s;ha's, there are three Lanthorns. Be&s;ides that, they make a large Blaze or Flame aloft upon the Yard, and in the Head have &s;everal pieces of Cannon; upon the Ba&s;ha's there were ten, and on the Snout of the &s;tem, there is a Wooden Fi|gure of &s;ome Animal, Gilt, as a Lyon, Tygre, Eagle, or the like; on the Ba&s;ha's there was a Hydra. All the &s;everal <HI>Beys,</HI> the Sousba&s;ha, and many other Officers have al&s;o each of them one, be&s;ides &s;everal other &s;maller made like Galliots. About &s;even or eight a Clock in the Morning, the Ba&s;ha arri|ved with the u&s;ual Cavalcade. When he goes to any &s;uch Solemnity, he is mounted on a &s;tately Hor&s;e, in rich Trappings; and at this time he wore on his Head a lovely Flower of Diamonds. As he pa&s;&s;ed they killed Sheep in three or four places, and when he was about to enter into his Bark, three or four more were killed upon the River-&s;ide. Being with all the <HI>Beys</HI> entred into his Barge or <HI>Acaba,</HI> he went towards old <HI>Caire,</HI> and then all the <HI>Acabas</HI> &s;alu|ted him with their Guns, and followed him in order. The Ba&s;ha's <HI>Acaba,</HI> be|&s;ides that it was Towed by three Barges, &s;pread a Sail of many Colours, with a &s;et of five great Red-Ro&s;es upon it, and after it came a little Galliot all covered over with Flags and Streamers, wherein were &s;everal Drums, Flutes, Trumpets, and &s;uch like In&s;truments, many others al&s;o had the like Galliots full of Mu&s;icians. And in &s;hort, all that Fleet together, made a very plea&s;ant &s;hew; for it was a delightful &s;ight to &s;ee upon the <HI>Nile</HI> all the&s;e <HI>Aca|bas,</HI> which were above forty in number, and all the&s;e pretty party-coloured Sails, with their &s;ets of Flowers, all the Flags and &s;treaming Flames, which look'd very fine. Nor did the noi&s;e of Cannon, the &s;ound of infinite numbers of In&s;truments, and the &s;houts and acclamations of the People, contribute a little to the Magnificence of the Solemnity. In this manner they went gently along, firing now and then their Guns, till they came to the Bank which keeps out the Water from the <HI>Khalis.</HI> We could not &s;ee the opening made, be|cau&s;e of the great crowd and confu&s;ion, but it &s;ignifies no great matter; for all that is to be &s;een, is a va&s;t number of Rabble, who wait till the Ba&s;ha pa&s;s; and on each &s;ide of the Dyke a Paper-Tower, with Walls of the &s;ame reaching to the Dyke, and &s;tuck full of Squibs and Serpents, which as &s;oon as the Ba&s;ha pa&s;&s;es are fired, and &s;et one another on fire, whil&s;t the People break down the Dyke with Pick-axes, Shovels, and &s;uch like In&s;truments, and removing the Earth make way for the Water. There are Boats loaded with Fruit and Sweet-meats (&s;uch as they make) which are thrown among the People, and one may have the plea&s;ure to &s;ee them jump in, and &s;wim for a &s;hare. In the mean time the Ba&s;ha goes forward to his <HI>Serraglio,</HI> which is in the middle of the <HI>Nile</HI> hard by, and over again&s;t old <HI>Caire,</HI> and there &s;tays during the three days that the Bonfires la&s;t. So &s;oon as they have begun to break down the Bank, the Sousba&s;ha, or his Lieutenant (as it happened this
<PB N="234" REF="137">
Year) comes on Hor&s;e-back along the <HI>Khalis,</HI> and about eleven a Clock in the Forenoon, &s;tops before the Hou&s;e of the French Con&s;ul, where he orders two Rockets to be played; and the Con&s;ul gives him five or &s;ix Pia&s;tres, which are his due every Year at that Ceremony; the like he does to all the other Con&s;uls. About Noon the Water pa&s;&s;es by the Quarters of the French, and advances with pretty much Rapidity, being full of Rabble. (As I related in the De&s;cription of the opening of the <HI>Khalis</HI> the Year before.) Much about the &s;ame time the <HI>Khalis</HI> of <HI>Alexandria,</HI> that fills the Ci&s;terns of that Town, and all the other <HI>Khalis</HI> are opened. The &s;ame day in the Evening, we took a <HI>Cayque</HI> and went to old <HI>Caire,</HI> and as &s;oon as we came near it, we began to &s;ee on all hands a &s;hoar, and upon the Water a va&s;t number of large Figures made of Lamps, placed in &s;uch and &s;uch order, as of Cro&s;&s;es, Mo&s;ques, Stars, Cro&s;&s;es of <HI>Malta,</HI> Trees, and an infinite number of the like, from one end of old <HI>Caire</HI> to the other. There were two Statues of Fire, repre&s;enting a Man and a Woman; which at the farther di&s;tance they were &s;een, the more love|ly they appeared: The&s;e Figures were two &s;quare Machines of Wood, two Pikes length high, each in a Boat, and both were placed before the Palace where they mea&s;ure the Water, and where the Ba&s;ha tarries during the three days of Rejoycing. One of them is on the one &s;ide of the Water, and the other on the other &s;ide, each ten paces from Land, leaving a broad pa&s;&s;age betwixt them for Boats and Barges. The&s;e Machines are filled with Lamps from top to bottom, which are lighted as &s;oon as it is Night. In each of the&s;e Figures there are above two thou&s;and Lamps, which are &s;o placed, that on all &s;ides you &s;ee a Man and a Woman of Fire. Be&s;ides that, all the <HI>Acabas,</HI> or Barks of the Ba&s;ha and <HI>Beys,</HI> are al&s;o full of Lamps, and their Mu&s;ick of Trumpets, Flutes, and Drums, which keep almo&s;t a continual Noi&s;e, mingled with that of Squibs, Crackers, Fire-Lances, great and &s;mall Shot; &s;o that the va&s;t num|ber of Lamps, with the cracking of the Gun-powder, and noi&s;e of Mu&s;ick, make a kind of agreeable Confu&s;ion, that without doubt, chears up the mo&s;t De|jected and Melancholick. This la&s;ts till Midnight, and then all retire; the Lamps burning all Night, unle&s;s they be put out by the Wind and Squibs. This Solemnity continues for three Nights.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The cu&s;tome of the anci|ent Aegypti|ans at the o|pening of the <HI>Khalis.</HI></NOTE> The opening of the <HI>Khalis,</HI> hath in all times been very famous, even among the Ancient Egyptians, as being that which nouri&s;hes the Country; and at that Solemnity, they yearly Sacrificed a Boy and a Girl, upon whom the Lot fell, fir&s;t cutting their Throat, and then throwing them into the <HI>Nile.</HI> In memory whereof, the Turks at this day, make the above-mentioned Figures of a Man and a Woman, which they fill with Fire; and in this manner they divert them&s;elves, during the three Nights allotted for that rejoycing, and when the Water is very high, there are Men who Swim in the <HI>Khalis,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">A Swimmer loaded with Chains.</NOTE> with Iron-Chains. One of the&s;e Swimmers I &s;aw pa&s;s by, and not without Ceremony: Before him went a great Boat full of People, of whom &s;ome beat the Drum, others had Fire-locks to &s;hoot at tho&s;e who &s;hould throw &s;tones, and then he came in the middle of twenty Per&s;ons that Swam about him. His Hands were tied behind his Back, and his Feet bound with a Chain of Iron, that weighed ten pound weight, he &s;tood up|right in the Water, and di&s;cour&s;ed with tho&s;e that were about him, not &s;eeming in the lea&s;t to move. He was followed by five or &s;ix Boats full of People, ready to take him up if he chanced to &s;ink: In this manner he came in the Water from old <HI>Caire</HI> where the <HI>Khalis</HI> begins, to the place where it ends, which is a long League. For a reward he has from the Ba&s;ha, a Ve&s;t, and a thou&s;and <HI>Maidins;</HI> and be&s;ides that, he goes about the Town with a Box, and gets &s;omewhat more. In this manner he goes twice, on two &s;everal days. There is another al&s;o who Swims in Chains, &s;urrounded as the other, from end to end of the <HI>Khalis,</HI> and holds in each hand a di&s;h of Coffee, with a Pipe of Tobacco in his Mouth, without &s;pilling the Coffee. He performs this twice, and has the &s;ame reward as the other had. The&s;e Swimmers &s;hew only on <HI>Fridays,</HI> &s;o that one may &s;ee them once a Week, during four Weeks.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. LXVII.</HI> Of the Arrival of the Bey of <HI>Girge</HI> at <HI>Caire.</HI></HEAD>
<P><HI>WEdne&s;day</HI> the fourth of <HI>September, Mehmet Bey,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The arrival of the Bey of <HI>Girge.</HI></NOTE> who was then Bey of <HI>Girge,</HI> arrived near to <HI>Caire,</HI> and Lodged at <HI>Bezeten</HI> beyond old <HI>Caire,</HI> in Tents. This Bey had been a Slave to one <HI>Haley Bey,</HI> who died very Rich, in the year One thou&s;and &s;ix hundred fifty five, when he was Bey of <HI>Girge,</HI> which is fourteen or fifteen days Journey from <HI>Caire,</HI> up the <HI>Nile.</HI> In his Life|time he had made four of his Slaves Beys, of whom this was one; and after his death Bey of <HI>Girge.</HI> When <HI>Haley Bey</HI> died, he left behind him Four&s;core thou&s;and Camels, and about as many A&s;&s;es; and be&s;ides that, a va&s;t Trea&s;ure of Coyned Money and Jewels, among which there was a Cup made of a Tur|keis, worth above an Hundred thou&s;and Crowns. This Man lived at a very high Rate, and there was not a day but he &s;pent a thou&s;and Crowns in his Hou&s;e at <HI>Caire,</HI> though he were not there, but much more when he was. His Suc|ce&s;&s;or (<HI>Mehmet Bey</HI> I &s;peak of) was &s;ent for by two <HI>Agas,</HI> one after another, and commanded in name of the Ba&s;ha, (who had no kindne&s;s for him) to come to <HI>Caire,</HI> and account for what he was in Arrear to the Ba&s;ha, for that is a Bey|&s;hip depending on the Ba&s;&s;a&s;hip of <HI>Caire.</HI> The de&s;ign of the Ba&s;ha was to draw him to <HI>Caire,</HI> under this pretext, then to deprive him of his Bey&s;hip, and give it to another; which was a &s;ecret he had di&s;covered to no Man living. The Bey who &s;u&s;pected the Ba&s;ha's de&s;ign, having at fir&s;t &s;lighted his Commands, re&s;olved at length to come; but &s;eeing the Ba&s;ha knew that he came with a great Retinue, he &s;ent an <HI>Aga</HI> to command him back. This <HI>Aga</HI> found him at three days Journey from <HI>Caire,</HI> and acquainted him with his Orders, which the other &s;lighted, and proceeded on his Journey till he came near to <HI>Caire. Thur&s;day</HI> the fifth of <HI>September,</HI> all the Beys and other Per&s;ons of Quality, went out to vi&s;it him, as al&s;o all the Militia of the Country. The Beys, and the <HI>Cadi|le&s;quer,</HI> (who was no friend to this Ba&s;ha) had laid their Heads together to make the Ba&s;ha <HI>Man&s;oul,</HI> in ca&s;e he gave bad Reception to this Bey, becau&s;e, be&s;ides that they were all his friends, they always &s;tick together again&s;t the Ba&s;ha. He made his entry into <HI>Caire,</HI> on <HI>Saturday</HI> the &s;eventh of <HI>September,</HI> and that I might have a full view of that entry, I went to <HI>Cara Meidan,</HI> which is a great Court or Square in the Ba&s;ha's Palace, at the end whereof the Stables are. This is a large and &s;pacious place, but longer than broad. The Ba&s;ha came down, and went into a <HI>Kieusk,</HI> which is about the middle of the length of this place, on the right hand as you enter it from the <HI>Romeille:</HI> The Ba&s;ha &s;taid for him here, becau&s;e the Bey would not go to his Appartment, fear|ing he might not be &s;trong enough for him there. Thither came all the Men of the Beys, and all the <HI>Spahis, Chiaoux, Muteferacas,</HI> and in a word, all the Militia, ready to fight: For &s;eeing they knew not the Ba&s;ha's de&s;ign, and &s;aw on the other hand that the Bey was well accompanied, they doubted it might come to blows. The&s;e Men of the Beys played for the matter of two Hours with the <HI>Dgerit,</HI> or <HI>Zagaye,</HI> which was a great Diver&s;ion to me; for there I &s;aw them at near di&s;tance with &s;afety and ea&s;e, whereas when they &s;ee a Chri|&s;tian abroad in the Fields, they many times dart their <HI>Dgerit</HI> at him. After that, they drew neatly up into very clo&s;e Order: And at the &s;ame time, by the Gate oppo&s;ite to that which goes into the <HI>Romeille,</HI> the <HI>Arabs</HI> of this Bey en|tred the place, armed with Pikes, and Shables four fingers broad, every one with his Iron-Hook a finger broad, and as big as ones Hand, with a Wooden Handle, to take up their Pikes without alighting from Hor&s;e-back as they run, after they have darted them at any Body; as they who make u&s;e of Arrows, have &s;uch another Iron-In&s;trument, wherewith they hook up their Arrows from the Ground; and both are very dextrous at it.

The ten fir&s;t were cloathed in Green Vel|vet, with a large Collar of the &s;ame Stuff, covered over with Plates of Gold, having neat Bows and Quivers full of pretty Arrows, with Shables by their &s;ides: The ten that came next were Apparelled in Yellow Satin, carrying each a Pike, a Shield and a Shable. The re&s;t were all well Cloathed too, every one carrying a Carbine and Shable, and in the Rear of them, ten play|ed on Timbrels, and as many on Trumpets and Flutes; be&s;ides all the&s;e, there were above &s;ixty Men playing on Timbrels, every one mounted on a Camel, who being di&s;per&s;ed here and there through the Cavalcade, made a great Noi&s;e. They drew all up in the <HI>Cara Meidan,</HI> but though it be a large place, yet it could not contain both them and the Militia of <HI>Caire,</HI> &s;o that a good many of them were forced to March out into the <HI>Romeille,</HI> to make room for the re&s;t. When the Bey came near the <HI>Kieusk,</HI> he alighted from his Hor&s;e, and went unto it, where the Ba&s;ha expected him; and treated him with Coffee, Sorbet, and a Perfume, pre&s;enting him and every one of his Officers with a Caftan a piece. Whil&s;t he was there, I went to a narrow Avenue at the end of the <HI>Romeille,</HI> through which he was to pa&s;s; &s;oon after, we &s;aw him and all his Men pa&s;s that way in File. I reckoned all tho&s;e of his Retinue who had <HI>Caftans,</HI> and found them to be an hundred and eight, and they marched in the &s;ame Order as they came. The <HI>Kiaya</HI> of the Ba&s;ha waited upon the Bey back to his Hou&s;e, which was not far di&s;tant: However that was a thing extraordinary, for it is not the cu&s;tome for the <HI>Kiaya</HI> of a Ba&s;ha to wait upon a Bey; he &s;aluted all the People on both hands as he went, who all &s;houted, and wi&s;hed him a thou&s;and Ble&s;|&s;ings. The Turks and People of the Country, were much &s;urpri&s;ed to &s;ee &s;o many Men, &s;aying, That there was no King &s;o powerful as he. The truth is, the Bey of <HI>Girge</HI> is a very mighty Prince when he is beloved of his Subjects, who are all Warlike, &s;o that when he is at <HI>Girge,</HI> he values not the <HI>Grand Sig|nior</HI> him&s;elf. And neverthele&s;s, a Year after this &s;olemn entry, the Ba&s;ha of <HI>Caire</HI> having made War with him (who &s;eemed to be very well beloved of his Subjects) he took him, and cau&s;ed him immediately to be Strangled. His <HI>Arabs,</HI> who were his greate&s;t &s;trength, and in whom he put mo&s;t Confidence, having for&s;aken him; but it was thought they were corrupted by the Ba&s;ha. This Bey kept in his Hou&s;e about him a Guard of Two thou&s;and Men, and the re&s;t of his Forces returned to <HI>Bezeten,</HI> and the <HI>Rode,</HI> which is a Country-hou&s;e belonging to him, over again&s;t old <HI>Caire,</HI> but they came daily to the City to know how the Affaires of their Ma&s;ter &s;tood, becau&s;e he mi&s;tru&s;ted &s;ome bad de&s;ign again&s;t him; and therefore when he went abroad in the Town, he took always Three thou&s;and Hor&s;e along with him. This Bey pre&s;ented the Ba&s;ha in Money and Hor&s;es, to the value of eighty Pur&s;es, and it was judged, that that Journey would co&s;t him Three hundred Pur&s;es; and indeed, he had brought Two thou&s;and Pur&s;es with him, which amount to fifty Millions of <HI>Maidins,</HI> or

This A&s;s had a black Li&s;t down the Back, and the re&s;t of its Body was all begirt with White and Tawny &s;treaks, a finger broad a piece; the Head of it was extraordinarily long, &s;triped and partly coloured as the re&s;t of the Body: its Ears like a Buffles, were very wide at the end, and black, yellow and white; its Legs &s;treaked ju&s;t like the Body, not long ways, but round the Leg in fa&s;hion of a Garter down to the Foot, and all in &s;o good proportion and Symmetry, that no Lynx could be more exactly &s;potted, nor any Skin of a Tygre &s;o pretty. The Amba&s;&s;adour had two more &s;uch A&s;&s;es, which died by the way, but he brought their Skins with him, to be pre&s;ented to the <HI>Grand Signior,</HI> with the live one.

that Countrey are the Mines out of which, they have the Gold that pa&s;&s;es on the Coa&s;ts of <HI>Soffala</HI> and <HI>Guiney.</HI> The&s;e Mines are not deep, as in many other Countreys. From that Countrey al&s;o comes the Civet. I think it will not be ami&s;s, here to &s;ay &s;omewhat of Civets, which are &s;o rare in our Countrey, as that they de&s;erve to be taken notice of where one can find them. They are called <HI>Civet-Cats,</HI> come from <HI>Naria,</HI> (as I ju&s;t now &s;aid) and are taken in Snares. The Jews in <HI>Caire</HI> keep many of them in their Hou&s;es, where for buying a few drachms of Civet, one may &s;ee them. It is a Bea&s;t almo&s;t as big as a good Dog;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Civet.</NOTE> it hath a &s;harp Snout, &s;mall Eyes, little Ears, and mu&s;tachios like a Cat; the Skin of it is all &s;potted black and white, with &s;ome <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="3+ letters">wi&s;h &s;pecks, and hath a long bu&s;hy Tail, almo&s;t like a Fox. It is a very wild Creature; and I believe the bite of it would put a body to no &s;mall pain, The Jews keep them in great &s;quare wooden Cages, where they feed them with raw Mutton and Beaf, cut into &s;mall Pieces.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The way of getting Civet</NOTE> When they would get from them that which is called Civet, (and is the Sweat of this Bea&s;t, that &s;mells &s;o &s;weet) they make him go back with a &s;tick which they thru&s;t in betwixt the Bars of the Cage and catch hold of his Tail; when they have that fa&s;t, they take hold al&s;o of his two hind Legs, pulling him half out of the Cage by the Door, which falls down upon his Back, and keeps him fa&s;t there, then another opens a certain Cod of Fle&s;h that the&s;e Bea&s;ts have, which is &s;haped like a &s;plit Gy&s;erne, and with an Iron-Spatula &s;crapes all the Sweat off of it within. The Males have that piece of Fle&s;h betwixt their Stones and Yard, which is like a Cats. The Females have it betwixt their Fundament and Privities; and it is emptied of the Sweat but twice a Week, each Bea&s;t yielding about a drachm at a time, by what I could di&s;cern. When that Sweat or Excrement is taken out, it is of a whiti&s;h grey, but by little and little in &s;ome &s;hort &s;pace it turns to a very brown colour. It &s;mells very &s;weet at a di&s;tance, but near hand it &s;tinks and cau&s;es a Head-ach. There are as many kinds of Civet-Sweat, as there are of Civet-Cats, for it is more whiti&s;h, greyi&s;h, or yellowi&s;h, and dryer in &s;ome than in others, and yet they mingle all together.<NOTE PLACE="marg">There is no pure Civet to be had.</NOTE> After all, it is in vain to think to have pure Civet, for the Jews fal&s;ifie it; and if a Man imagine it to be pure becau&s;e he has &s;een it taken from the Bea&s;t, he is mi&s;taken, for before People come to their Hou&s;es, they rub the in&s;ide of that piece of Fle&s;h, with a little Oyl or &s;ome &s;uch &s;tuff, that &s;o the Sweat and it together may make more weight, but when no body is pre&s;ent, they take it out pure, and mingle it afterwards. To find out the truth of this, I went one day to the Hou&s;e of a Jew that kept Civet Cats, without giving him notice before, (for becau&s;e I had bought a little of him, and promi&s;ed to come again another time, he asked me as often as he &s;aw me, what day I would come) and having de&s;ired him to get me &s;ome fre&s;h Civet, he told me that it was not the day he u&s;ed to take it out; and ha|ving returned without acquainting him before, upon one of the days when he &s;aid he was accu&s;tomed to gather it, he refu&s;ed then al&s;o to do it, pretending bu&s;ine&s;s, which confirmed all that had been told me of that maitter. In the mean time, they hold the&s;e Bea&s;ts very dear, for havihg a&s;ked that Jew, and others al&s;o, how much they would have of me, for a <HI>Civet</HI> Cat,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dangala. Baberins.</NOTE> they all told me, an hundred <HI>Chequins. Dangala,</HI> is the Capital City of <HI>Nubia,</HI> the King of <HI>Dangala,</HI> is King of the <HI>Barberins,</HI> who are a kind of Blacks, of the Mu&s;ulman Religion, that came in crouds to <HI>Caire</HI> to get Services; they are &s;omewhat &s;illy, but very faithful, and &s;erve for a &s;mall matter; for two <HI>Maidins</HI> a day, or a <HI>Maidin</HI> and their Diet; you may make them do what&s;oever you plea&s;e. They wear a blew-Shirt, plat all their Hair in Tre&s;&s;es, and then rub it over with a certain Oyl, to keep their Head from being Lou&s;ie. At <HI>Caire</HI> when they have any falling out, they go before the <HI>Scheiks</HI> of their own Nation, who make them Friends, and if they think It convenient, adjudge them to pay a Fine, with which they Fea&s;t and make merry together. They are great lovers of Crocodiles Fle&s;h; and when any Frank has got one for the Skin, they come and beg the Fle&s;h, which they dre&s;s with a pretty good Sawce. When the&s;e blades have &s;craped together ten or twelve <HI>Pia&s;tres,</HI> they return home again wealthy to their own Countrey, provided they e&s;cape being Robbed by the <HI>Arabs</HI> upon the way, who many times &s;erve them &s;o, therefore they

commonly return in companies, as they came. The King of <HI>Dangala</HI> pays his Tribute to the King of <HI>Aethiopia,</HI> in Cloath. The Provinces of <HI>Aethiopia,</HI> are <HI>Gouyan,</HI> (where the King keeps a Vice-Roy.) <HI>Beghandir, Dambia, Amara,</HI> (which is a great Province full of Mountains and good Ca&s;tles) <HI>Damoud Tegre,</HI> and <HI>Barnegas.</HI> Be&s;ides, there are &s;everal Provinces Governed by Princes, who are Va&s;&s;als to the King of <HI>Aethiopia.</HI> In &s;hort, the Kingdom of <HI>Aethiopia,</HI> comprehends twenty four <HI>Tambours</HI> or Vice-Roys. The Capital City is called <HI>Gonthar,</HI> and is in the Province of <HI>Dambia. Aethiopia,</HI> (as the Amba&s;&s;adour told me) is as cold as <HI>Aleppo</HI> or <HI>Dama&s;cus,</HI> only the Countries near the <HI>Red-Sea,</HI> and the Countrey of <HI>Sennar</HI> are hot. The King of <HI>Aethiopia</HI> has above an hundred Wives, and keeps no Eunuchs to look after them, becau&s;e they look upon it as a Sin to Geld a Man; &s;o that the Women have the &s;ame liberty there as in Chri&s;tendom. He is a King of very ea&s;ie acce&s;s, and the poore&s;t have the freedom to come and &s;peak to him when they plea&s;e. He keeps all his Children on a Mountain, called <HI>Ouohhni,</HI> in the Province of <HI>Oinadaga,</HI> which is a Mountain two days Journey di&s;tant from <HI>Gonthar;</HI> there is a place like a Ci&s;tern on the top of the Mountain, into which they are let down every night, and taken up again in the day-time, and &s;uffered to play and walk about. When the King dies, they chu&s;e out one of the wittie&s;t of them, and make him King, without any regard to Birth-right: and when he comes to have Children, he &s;ends his Brothers Pri&s;oners to &s;ome other place, and places his Children at <HI>Ouohhni.</HI> The place where the Kings are Buried, is called <HI>Aye&s;us,</HI> and is a kind of Grott; where the Aged are laid in one &s;ide, and the young in the other. Heretofore there was a Church there of the &s;ame name, in time of the Je&s;uits; and in the &s;ame place, there is an excellent Library, where are all &s;orts of Books in all kinds of Languages in great plenty, and may be &s;een by tho&s;e who have the Curio&s;ity. The Amba&s;&s;adour a&s;&s;ured me, that he had been in that Library, and I fancy it is the old Library of the Ancient <HI>Aethiopians. Aethiopia</HI> is a good and fertile Countrey, producing Wheat, Barley, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> The greate&s;t De&s;arts of it, are not above three or four days Journey over; and neverthele&s;s, when the King makes any progre&s;s, he always lodges in Tents. The Hou&s;es of the great Lords, are like tho&s;e of <HI>Caire,</HI> that is to &s;ay, very mean in re&s;pect of the Hou&s;es of Europe, and the re&s;t are only of Mud. The Countrey affords men of all Trades, except Watch-makers. They have no Camels there, but Mules, A&s;&s;es, Oxen and Hor|&s;es. All the people of this Countrey eat raw Fle&s;h, except the King, who has it dre&s;s'd, and drinks Wine of Grapes; the re&s;t drink only Wine made of Millet or Sara&s;in wheat, but as &s;trong as ours, and Brandy made of the &s;ame Grain. They are Cloathed after the fa&s;hion of the Franks, and wear Cloath, Velvet and other Stuffs imported to them by the <HI>Red-Sea.</HI> They have Harque|bu&s;&s;es from the Turks, and of tho&s;e People, there are not above three or four hundred, who &s;erve in the Wars with Harquebu&s;&s;es. In Trading they make no u&s;e of Coined Money, as the Europeans do, but their money are pieces of fifteen or twenty <HI>Pics</HI> of Cloath, Gold, which they give by weight, and a kind of Salt, which they reduce into little &s;quare pieces like pieces of Soap, and the&s;e pa&s;s for Money. They cut out that Salt upon the &s;ide of the <HI>Red-Sea,</HI> five or &s;ix days Journey from <HI>Dangala,</HI> as you go from <HI>Caire,</HI> and the places where they make it, are called <HI>Arho.</HI> Among them is the Nation of the <HI>Gaules,</HI> whom in Aethiopick they call <HI>Chava,</HI> and are a Vagabond people in <HI>Aethiopia,</HI> as the <HI>Arabs</HI> are in <HI>Aegypt;</HI> the&s;e <HI>Gaules</HI> are rich in Cattel, and are always at Wars with the <HI>Aethiopians,</HI> They have no Harquebu&s;&s;es, nor other Fire-Arms, but make u&s;e of Lances and Targets.

<P>IN the month of <HI>November</HI> there was an <HI>E&s;ine</HI> kept at <HI>Caire,</HI> that is to &s;ay,<NOTE PLACE="marg">E&s;ine.</NOTE> a publick Rejoicing, becau&s;e the Turks had taken two Ca&s;tles in <HI>Hungary.</HI> It was proclaim'd on the eighth of <HI>November</HI> after noon, there being a man who cried it in every Quarter; and the chief Cryer went in a <HI>Caftan</HI> to adver|ti&s;e the Beys and Con&s;uls, and got money in the Streets: They Cried it for &s;even days, to begin on <HI>Saturday</HI> the ninth of <HI>November,</HI> at the hour of Evening Prayers, though it u&s;ed not to la&s;t above three days. This <HI>Saturday</HI> morning the Guns were fired from the Ca&s;tle, which continued to be done every mor|ning as long as the <HI>E&s;ine</HI> la&s;ted, and then all fell to work before their doors, the poore&s;t Man that is, being ready on &s;uch occa&s;ions to lay out &s;omewhat on Lamps and Stuffs: It is a very plea&s;ant thing to be &s;een, e&s;pecially in the Night-time, when one may go abroad with greater &s;afety and freedom than in the day at any other time; for by Lamp-light they cannot tell whether your Turban be white or of any other Colour, and &s;o they know not whether you be Chri&s;tian or Turk. All the &s;treets are full of Lamp-lights, but e&s;pecially &s;ome, wherein there are a va&s;t number of Lights, not only before the Gates, but within the Hou&s;es of the Beys, and other Per&s;ons of Quality. Be&s;ides that, the &s;treets are hung with lovely Hangings of Cloath of Gold, and other rich &s;tuffs; among others, there are &s;ome Streets where|in all the Shops are hung with Cloath of Gold, and rich &s;ilk Stuffs flowered with Gold. In many places al&s;o, you may &s;ee plea&s;ant figures of Chri&s;tian Franks, which to them is a great Diver&s;ion. Be&s;ides the Tapi&s;tery and Lamps which are to be &s;een in the Hou&s;es of the Beys, they make a &s;hew al&s;o in the entry of all &s;orts of Arms and Armour; as Head-pieces, Cor&s;lets, Coats of Mail, Mu&s;quets, Swords and Targets, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which are ranked in very good order.

though it were even a rejoycing for a Victory obtained by the Turks over their own Country, el&s;e they would have an <HI>Avanie</HI> put upon them, and therefore when they keep an <HI>E&s;inie</HI> for a Victory over the Venetians, the Con&s;ul of <HI>Venice</HI> is obliged to do as others do, if he had not rather pay the next day a &s;winging <HI>Avanie.</HI> There they expo&s;e, be&s;ides Lamps and Tapi&s;try, &s;everal excellent Pictures, which the Turks look upon with a great deal of plea&s;ure, e&s;pecially when it is &s;ome good Face; thinking it impo&s;&s;ible that we &s;hould have &s;uch Beauties in Chri&s;tendom, nay, that there can be any &s;uch in the World. The Women came al&s;o, being allowed then, as at <HI>Bairam,</HI> to go abroad and &s;ee the Fe&s;tival, yet not the great Ladies, as tho&s;e of the Ba&s;ha's, Beys, and others of higher Quality, but only tho&s;e of an inferiour Condi|tion.

And no &s;ooner did any come, how mean &s;oever he was, but he had Coffee and Tobacco brought to him, &s;o that the Expence went high; for betwixt morning early, and three a Clock after Midnight, many thou&s;ands of People came. This Fe&s;tival ended on <HI>Friday</HI> Morning, the fifteenth of <HI>November,</HI> &s;o that the <HI>E&s;ine</HI> la&s;ted but &s;ix days, though it had been cried for &s;even, becau&s;e the Infe|riour &s;ort of People were at too great Charges, and got nothing, for during that time, no Man was &s;uffered to Work.</P>

This is a very ancient Mona&s;tery, the Walls are very high, but it is much decaied. There are many holy bodies in it, but only one of the&s;e approved of by the Church of <HI>Rome;</HI> to wit, that of St. <HI>Macha|rius,</HI> as al&s;o five or &s;ix Altar-Tables of lovely Marble. Within the Precinct of this Mona&s;tery, there is a kind of a big &s;quare Tower, into which you enter by a Draw-bridge; and wherein there is a Church, a Well, and all that is nece&s;&s;ary for the Service of the Church, and the &s;orry &s;u&s;tenance of the Re|ligious, who &s;ometimes retreat into it. For when they find them&s;elve abu&s;ed, and pur&s;ued by &s;tranger <HI>Arabs,</HI> they betake them&s;elves to this kind of &s;trong Hold, and pull up the Draw-bridge after them, keeping there whatever they have of Value in the Mona&s;tery, e&s;pecially all their Books which they &s;o e&s;teem, that no Monk dares to Sell, or put out of the way any of them, under the pain of <HI>Anathema.</HI> In this manner, all the three other Mona&s;teries, (of which we &s;hall &s;peak hereafter) have Towers in them. This Mona&s;tery is the greate&s;t, but al&s;o the mo&s;t ruinous, and e&s;pecially the Church that &s;eems to have been very fair in times pa&s;t. There is no Garden belonging to it, and the Water which the Monks drink is &s;omewhat bracki&s;h.</P>
<P>From St. <HI>Macharius,</HI> you go to another, called <HI>Ambabichoye,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ambabichoye.</NOTE> lying North|ward of the former, three or four Hours journey only. Upon the way thither, you &s;ee a great many little Eminences, or Ri&s;ings, about a &s;tep over, which cut the way, and reach far into the We&s;tern De&s;art: The Religious &s;ay, and find it Recorded in their Books (which are very ancient,) that this Ri&s;ing was made by Angels, to &s;erve for a path to the Hermites, who many times lo&s;t their way, when on Sundays they were coming to Ma&s;s in the Mona&s;tery, and therefore they call it <HI>Tarik el Melaike,</HI> that is to &s;ay, the Angels Way.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tarik el Ma|laike.</NOTE> By the way al&s;o you &s;ee many old Walls, which are the ruines of &s;everal Mona|&s;teries that heretofore have been there, and as the Monks &s;ay, to the number of three hundred, round that Mountain; but the Ruines which remain at pre|&s;ent, make it not appear that the number has been &s;o great. It is true, one mu&s;t not think, that they have been perfect Mona&s;teries, but only little Hou&s;es built by Seculars, who had a mind to retire into the De&s;art, and lead a Reli|gious Life there; being obliged on Sundays and all Holy Days, to come to Ma&s;s in the next Mona&s;tery, there to a&s;&s;i&s;t at Divine Service. And in that Mona&s;tery there was an Abbot, with a certain number of re&s;iding Monks, who when they had a mind to lead a more au&s;tere Life, and were found to be &s;uf|ficiently qualified for that, by their Superiour, were &s;uffered by him to leave the Convent, and go live more &s;olitary further off in the Mountain, where they built little Hermitages, and there &s;pent their lives in great Au&s;terity, Silence, and continual Meditation; and this is the account the Religious give. It is not good to follow that Angels way, nor to be too curious in ask|ing que&s;tions of the <HI>Arabs</HI> about it, for then they would pre&s;ently conclude, that you were come to the Mountain to &s;earch for &s;ome Trea&s;ure hid in it, which they fancy the Franks know of. Among the&s;e old buildings, you &s;ee the ruines of a Mona&s;tery, built in honour of St. <HI>John the Little,</HI> and is called <HI>Juhhanna el Ka&s;ir,</HI> where there is &s;till a Dome, and the dry Rod, which being watered by that good Hermite, at the command of his Superiour, was changed into a fair Tree, which is to be &s;een at this day, as a monument of the merit of Obedience. The Monks call this Tree <HI>Chadgeret el Taa,</HI> that is to &s;ay,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chadgeret el Taa.</NOTE> the Tree of Obedience. The Mona&s;tery of <HI>Ambabichoye,</HI> is the plea&s;ante&s;t of all the four, for it has a fair Church, a lovely Garden, and good Water, with a big Tower in it, as in that of St. <HI>Macharius.</HI> There were a great many holy bodies therein, which on Palm-Sunday, in the Year 1656. were burnt by a &s;park that fell from a Taper that had been left burning there; whereupon the Monks being vexed that they had lo&s;t their Saints, gave it out that they had been carried away by a French Merchant, who came into tho&s;e Quarters to buy <HI>Natron.</HI> But finding that the device would not take, though it co&s;t the Merchant Money, (for the Turks would not let &s;lip that occa&s;ion,) they rai&s;ed &s;ome dead bodies and brought them into their Church, publi&s;hing that they were the bodies of their Saints, which had e&s;caped out of the French Ships, and were come back to their Church.

This and the <HI>Hippopotamus</HI> are the only Animals, who in eating move the upper Jaw, and move not at all the under. The Crocodile is very &s;trong, and one day as I cau&s;ed one of them, which was eight Foot long, to be skinned, four Men &s;tood upon it, whil&s;t they were &s;litting up his Belly, but it &s;tirred and &s;trugled with &s;o much force, that it threw them all four off; it is al&s;o very &s;trong liv'd, for when they skin it, after they have cut the Throat and opened the Belly of it, if it catch hold of any thing in its mouth, it will never part from it. As it happened once to a <HI>Moor</HI> whom I knew, who having skinned one for a French-man, (who had a mind to keep the Skin) and cutting the Throat, had &s;eparated the Head from the Body, &s;o that there remained no more but the Head &s;ticking to the Skin, all the fle&s;h being taken out; he untied the Snout, but immediately thereupon the Jaws opening, caught hold of one of his Fingers, which with its Teeth, it cut clear off. The fle&s;h of a Crocodile is not bad, but it is &s;omewhat in&s;ipid, and not at all poy&s;onous, as many believe, for I have ta&s;ted of it, and found it to be good; the <HI>Barbarians</HI> eat heartily, and make a great Fea&s;t of it. The&s;e Crea|tures are great lovers of Mens fle&s;h, and therefore they are very terrible all along the <HI>Nile,</HI> not only to little Boys, whom they frequently devour when they come to the River-&s;ide to do their Needs, for the&s;e cunning creatures hide them&s;elves; but al&s;o to Men, whom they &s;urpri&s;e &s;ometimes in their Boats. For in the Night-time they ri&s;e upright, and thru&s;ting their Snout into the Boat, endeavour to catch hold of a Man, and if they can but pull him into the Water, they quickly ma&s;ter him; and that is the rea&s;on that no Body will willingly venture to Swim in the <HI>Nile.</HI> It is another mo&s;t erroneous fable al&s;o, that a Crocodile will weep like a young Child, to draw People about it whom it may devour;<NOTE PLACE="marg">How Croco|diles are ta|ken.</NOTE> it is a thing altogether unknown in that Country. To catch the&s;e Creatures, they make a great many Pits by the River-&s;ide, which they cover over with Sticks, and &s;uch other things, and &s;o when they come to pa&s;s over the&s;e Ditches, (e&s;pecially when the Water encrea&s;es, which is the time when mo&s;t of them are taken, becau&s;e then they venture farthe&s;t out) they fall into them, and cannot get out again. They let them fa&s;t there for &s;everal days, then let down &s;ome Gins with running Noo&s;es, wherewith they muzzle their Snout, and &s;o pull them up, and carry them to the Quarters of the Franks. The <HI>Moors</HI> &s;ay, That at old <HI>Caire</HI> there is a <HI>Tali&s;man</HI> again&s;t the Crocodiles, which makes that they never pa&s;s beyond old <HI>Caire;</HI> but that is fal&s;e, for there are of them at <HI>Ro&s;&s;etto</HI> and <HI>Damiette,</HI> and they are to be &s;een upon the way to <HI>Caire,</HI> not indeed, in any great number, becau&s;e commonly they keep off from the Sea; but there &s;ome at lea&s;t to be found there. They never come into the <HI>Khalis,</HI> becau&s;e (as I think) it is narrow; but if they did, they might do a great deal of mi&s;chief, for when the Water runs in it, it is full of Swimmers.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Hippopotamus.</NOTE>There are <HI>Hippopotamu&s;es,</HI> or Sea-Hor&s;es, al&s;o in this River, and there was one taken at <HI>Girge,</HI> in the Year 1658. which was immediately brought to <HI>Caire,</HI> where I &s;aw it in the Month of <HI>February,</HI> the &s;ame Year. This Creature was of a kind of Tawny Colour, the hinder part of it was much like to a Buffler, however its Legs were &s;horter and bigger; it was about the bigne&s;s of a Ca|mel, and had a Muzzle like an Ox. The Head of it is like to a Hor&s;es, and very great, but its Eyes &s;mall. It had a very thick Neck, a little Ear, wide and open No&s;trils, thick large Feet, and almo&s;t round, with four Toes in each, like a Crocodile, a little Tail like an Elephant, and little or no Hair upon the Skin, no more than an Elephant. In the lower Jaw it had four great Teeth half a Foot long, two whereof were crooked, and as big as the Horns of an Ox, and one on each &s;ide of the Jaw; the other two were &s;treight, and of the &s;ame bigne&s;s as the crooked, but &s;tanding out in length. Many &s;aid at fir&s;t, that it was a Sea-Buffler, but &s;ome others and I, knew it to be a Sea-Hor&s;e, becau&s;e of the de&s;cription that is given of it by Writers. It was brought

Dead to <HI>Caire,</HI> by &s;ome <HI>Janizaries,</HI> who &s;hot it on Land, where it was come to feed; they fired &s;everal &s;hot at it, before it fell, for the Bullets hardly pierced through its Skin, as I ob&s;erved, but they fired one &s;hot which hit it on the Jaw, and made it fall. For many years before, &s;uch an Animal had not been &s;een at <HI>Caire.</HI></P>
<P>But to return to the <HI>Nile,</HI> this River cau&s;es all the fruitfulne&s;s of <HI>Aegypt,</HI> and if it failed to overflow one year, there would be a Famine in the Land; nay if it did not ri&s;e &s;ixteen foot, there would be great Scarcity; as al&s;o if it grew four and twenty foot, it would likewi&s;e occa&s;ion a Dear <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word">; becau&s;e the water covering all the Land too long, Seed-time would be lo&s;t, when it ebbs off; it leaves a fat nitrous &s;lime upon the ground, which &s;o fattens the Land, that it would produce nothing, through too much Fatne&s;s, if they did not &s;ow Sand upon it, before they plant or &s;ow any thing therein; &s;o that they are at the &s;ame pains to put Sand on their Land to unfatten it, as we are to Dung ours. Not that it never rains there, as many Dreamers would have us believe in Chri&s;tendom, &s;queezing their Brains to give a rea&s;on for that which is not in Nature, for it rains much at <HI>Alexandria,</HI> and <HI>Ro&s;&s;etto</HI> al&s;o; but at <HI>Caire,</HI> which &s;tands higher, it rains le&s;s; and yet I have &s;een it rain very hard every year for two days together in the Month of <HI>December,</HI> and at the &s;ame time, it Thundered &s;o much, that the eleventh or twelfth night of the &s;aid month, a man in the Ca&s;tle was killed by Thunder, (though it had never been heard before that Thunder had killed any body at <HI>Caire.</HI> It is cold weather al&s;o in <HI>December,</HI> which I found by experience, but it is never &s;o cold that one &s;tands in need of a Fire.

Be&s;ides the&s;e, there are the Stranger Chri&s;tians, Turks and Jews; the &s;tranger Chri&s;tians are either Franks or Greeks. I &s;hall here &s;peak fir&s;t of the Moors, after I have &s;aid a word or two of the <HI>Aegyptians</HI> in general. The People of the Countrey,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The manners of the <HI>Aegyp+tians.</HI></NOTE> (generally &s;peaking) both Mu&s;ulmans and Chri&s;tians are all &s;warthy, they are exceeding wicked, great Rogues, Cowardly, lazy, Hypocrites, Buggerers, Robbers, treacherous, very greedy of Money, and will kill a man for a <HI>Maidin;</HI> in &s;hort, no vice comes a mi&s;s to them: they are Cowards to the highe&s;t degree, and are very loath to fight, but when they fall out, they huff, &s;cold, and make a terrible noi&s;e, as if they would cut one anothers Throats, and neverthele&s;s, they refer their controver&s;ie to the next man they meet, who makes them good Friends again; then Spectators and all together, (for they &s;oon gather to a croud) lifting up their Hands, &s;ay the prayer which they call <HI>Fatha,</HI> (I mean when they are Moors) and then they are better Friends than ever they were before. The&s;e wretches are u&s;ed by the Turks like &s;laves, or rather like Dogs, for they govern them with a Cudgel, and a Turk will knock a Moor on the head, and he not dare to re&s;i&s;t, and indeed, when they &s;peak to a Turk, they do it with great re&s;pect. They labour and cultivate all the Land, and yet the Bread they eat, is very bad, and have not their Bellies full of that neither, though it be a mo&s;t plentiful Countrey; and indead, they are of &s;o bad a nature, that they want to be well beaten, and love tho&s;e the better for it, who beat them like Dogs, &s;erving very well when they are &s;oundly drubbed, whereas they are in&s;upportable, and will do nothing when they are gently u&s;ed.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dgibn Halum</NOTE> They live a wretched life, their mo&s;t ordinary Diet being &s;alt Chee&s;e, which they call <HI>Dgibn Halum,</HI> with very cour&s;e Bread; their Bread is as broad as our Plates, made like thin Buns, and con&s;i&s;ts only of two round pieces of pa&s;te, and as thin as Parchment, clap'd together and &s;hewed to the Fire, &s;o that one of them may very well be eaten at three mouthfuls; but it is &s;o bad, not only for the blackne&s;s of it, but as being ill kned, wor&s;e bak'd, and full of Coals and A&s;hes, that I could never accu&s;tome my &s;elf to it: It is cheap enough indeed, for you may have eight of the&s;e Cakes for a <HI>Maidin,</HI> which is worth about three half pence. For their De&s;ert or after-cour&s;e, they &s;uck Sugar-Canes; they are al&s;o great eaters of ordinary Melons, water-Melons and the like, whereof they have great plenty, and many &s;orts which we have not, yet all cannot attain to them, though they be extraordinarily cheap. They are Apparrelled like the Turks when they are able; I mean the Moors, (for the Chri&s;tians wear neither any green, nor the white Turban) but mo&s;t part of them are half naked, and many have no more but a blew &s;hirt upon their body. They are a very ignorant &s;ort of people, and yet have Secrets which &s;urprize the mo&s;t knowing, many thinking them to be knacks of Magick; for to &s;ee a man take up a Viper in the Fields, handle and &s;troak it, open the mouth of it, and put his Finger therein, without the lea&s;t hurt, &s;eems very &s;trange to me. They bring whole Sacks full of them into the City, and &s;ell them to the Apothecaries: They come often to the Quarter of the French, and boldly thru&s;ting their hand into their Sacks, pull
<PB N="249" REF="144">
out a whole handful of them. One day one of the&s;e blades handling his Vipers in this manner in the quarter of the French, they brought a Pullet and made one of the Vipers bite it, which immediately thereupon died; &s;o that it evidently appeared, that the Moor had &s;omething about him which pre&s;erved him again&s;t their Poy&s;on. But I cannot tell what to &s;ay of a Moori&s;h Woman who lives in a corner clo&s;e by the quarter of France,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Moori&s;h Woman that pulls Worms out of Chil|drens Ears.</NOTE> and pulls worms out of Childrens Ears. When a Child does nothing but cry, and that they know it is ill, they carry it to that Woman, who laying the Child on its &s;ide upon her knee, &s;cratches the Ear of it, and then Worms like tho&s;e which breed in mu&s;ty weevely Flower, &s;eem to fall out of the Childs Ear; then turning it on the other &s;ide, &s;he &s;cratches the other Ear, out of which the like Worms drop al&s;o; and in all there may come out ten or twelve, which &s;he wraps up in a Linnen-Rag, and gives them to tho&s;e that brought the Child to her, who keep them in that Rag at home in their Hou&s;e; and when &s;he has done &s;o, &s;he gives them back the Child, which in reality cries no more. She once told me that &s;he performed this by means of &s;ome words, that &s;he &s;pake. There was a French Phy&s;ician and a great Naturali&s;t there, who attentively beheld this, and told me that he could not conceive how it could be done; but that he knew very well, that if a child had any of the&s;e Worms in its head, it would quickly die. In &s;o much, that the Moors and other Inhabitants of <HI>Caire,</HI> look upon this as a great Vertue, and give her every time a great many <HI>Maidins.</HI> They &s;ay, that it is a &s;ecret which hath been long in the Family. There are children every day carried to her, roaring and crying, and &s;uch as would &s;ee the thing done, need only to follow them, provided they be not Mu&s;ulman Women who carry them, for then it would co&s;t an <HI>Avanie;</HI> but when they are Chri&s;tian or Jewi&s;h Women, one may ea&s;ily enter, and give a few <HI>Maidins</HI> to that Worm-drawer. The Language that is &s;poken in <HI>Aegypt</HI> is the Arabick, which is a dialect of the Hebrew, but very copious,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Arabick Language.</NOTE> and the mo&s;t ample Language that ever I heard &s;poken, and is indeed u&s;ed in a great many Countreys; it is very difficult to be pronounced, becau&s;e it has many gut|tural words; and therefore when the Turks at <HI>Con&s;tantinople</HI> would make them|&s;elves merry, they make Arabs &s;peak that Language before them, and yet it is their holy Language for their <HI>Alcoran,</HI> and all their Prayers are in Arabick; it is a common &s;aying with them, <HI>That the Turki&s;h Language &s;erves in this World, the Arabick &s;hall be &s;poken in Paradi&s;e, and in Hell the Per&s;ian,</HI> which never|thele&s;s is a fine Tongue, and makes the greate&s;t part of the Turki&s;h Poems and Songs; but &s;eeing they extreamly hate the <HI>Per&s;ians,</HI> they revile every thing that concerns them.</P>

<P>THE Moors are <HI>Mahometans,</HI> but they have &s;ome Super&s;titions,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Circumci&s;ion of Moori&s;h Girls.</NOTE> which the Turks have not, for the Moors Circumci&s;e their Daughters, cutting off a little bit of that which is called the <HI>Nymphe,</HI> and that Circum|ci&s;ion is performed by Women. The Turks do not do &s;o, they only Circum|ci&s;e their Boys. As the Moors are great Hypocrites, &s;o have they many &s;orts of <HI>Santo</HI>'s among them. They have dancing <HI>Dervi&s;hes,</HI> of whom I wrote when I was at <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> but they have a great many others be&s;ides the&s;e, whom they much honour; among the re&s;t, there are &s;ome as horrible as the Dancers are plea&s;ant; I &s;aw none of them at <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> becau&s;e they perform
<PB N="250" REF="145">
their Ceremonies too late, (though there be &s;ome of them towards <HI>Tophana</HI>) but at <HI>Caire</HI> I have often &s;een them very ea&s;ily, becau&s;e they have a little Mo&s;que in the quarter of France. They are cloathed much in the &s;ame man|ner as the Dancers, and have felt-caps after the &s;ame fa&s;hion. The&s;e men &s;ay their prayers much oftener than the other Mu&s;ulmans do, but chiefly on <HI>Tue&s;|days</HI> and <HI>Thur&s;days</HI> about ten or eleven a clock at night. They all meet at the Mo&s;que at the call of him who goes up to the top of the Tower, then they fall a &s;inging &s;ome ver&s;es of the <HI>Alcoran,</HI> which they often repeat, &s;o that they have enough to la&s;t them till day, clapping their hands now and then again&s;t one anothers, playing on certain Drums and &s;uch like In&s;truments; but about the middle, after they have long &s;ung the <HI>Alcoran,</HI> they all ri&s;e upright and put them&s;elves into a Ring one behind another; then he who is the chief, &s;ings &s;ome prayers very loud; and in the mean time the re&s;t in&s;tantly &s;ay over and over, almo&s;t without fetching breath, <HI>Allah,</HI> which is to &s;ay God, making at every time a very low bow: &s;o that their &s;training to pronounce that word, which they draw out from the depth of their Brea&s;t, without intermi&s;&s;ion or taking breath, with the frequent bending of their Body in the&s;e inclinations, make them look like men po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, and e&s;pecially towards the end, when being quite out of Breath, one of them beats his Drum as fa&s;t as he can and the re&s;t pronounce the word <HI>Allah</HI> as fa&s;t, and almo&s;t as often as he &s;trikes upon his Drum; &s;o that they foam like mad Dogs, and &s;ome with the violence of &s;training, void Blood at the Mouth. This la&s;ts about half an hour; but towards the end, they &s;ay no more but <HI>Hou,</HI> that is to &s;ay, he, which is as good as if they had &s;aid God, becau&s;e they want &s;trength to pronounce <HI>Allah;</HI> in&s;omuch that to hear them about the end, one would think he heard &s;o many Hogs grunting, when that is done, they &s;it down as before, and take a little re&s;t, &s;inging other Prayers; then towards the end they &s;tart up and begin their &s;weet Mu&s;ick again, which they do three times, and then continue on &s;inging as before. I have often been &s;tun'd with this at <HI>Ro&s;&s;etto,</HI> where I fancy they do it more than in any other place, for my Chamber-Window looked into their Mo&s;que: I lodged in a <HI>Han</HI> becau&s;e I would not part from the <HI>Chiot</HI> Gentleman, with whom I came from <HI>Chio.</HI> But at <HI>Caire</HI> they have a little Mo&s;que in the quarter of the French, in which every <HI>Tue&s;day</HI> and <HI>Thur&s;day</HI> they fall to that Catterwouling about ten a Clock at Night; there they may ea&s;ily be &s;een from the &s;treet, &s;tanding over again&s;t the door of their Mo&s;que; for one mu&s;t have a &s;pecial care not to enter into it, nor indeed to &s;et foot upon the thre&s;hold of the door. The&s;e are a &s;ort of men that take a great deal of pains to damn them&s;elves. In their Proce&s;&s;ions you always &s;ee &s;ome of the&s;e fools, who foam at the mouth like mad Men, and with &s;hut eyes pronounce the word <HI>Hou,</HI> having a man on each &s;ide, to &s;upport them for fear of falling; and they who can keep longe&s;t in that Exta&s;ie, (for they think they are in an Exta&s;ie) are the greate&s;t Saints: There are <HI>Santo</HI>'s al&s;o in <HI>Aegypt</HI> who go &s;tark naked, many of whom I have &s;een without the lea&s;t rag to cover their Nakedne&s;s, either in Winter or Summer, but it is not very cold there, and they &s;uffer all their Hair to grow as long as it can, for greater Mortification. The&s;e men are highly honoured, and going to the Hou&s;es of the chief Per&s;ons of the City at dinner-time, they &s;it down at Table, dine, and &s;o go their way, and that is look'd upon as a ble&s;&s;ing to the Hou&s;e, they are very la&s;civious Rogues, and that for both Sexes; and it is no fiction, that many Women who cannot be got with Child, ki&s;s their <HI>Priapus</HI> with great veneration, nay &s;ometimes they procure a Great-Belly by them. There was one of the&s;e blades hretofore carried a great Stone hanging at his <HI>Glans,</HI> and the Women heartily ki&s;&s;ed it for a Big Belly. Others eat Serpents, and in my time there was one of them at <HI>Caire,</HI> whom they called the <HI>Scheik</HI> of the Serpents; this Man had always a great train of <HI>Scheiks</HI> and other people after him, when he went out, or returned home to his Hou&s;e. I did not &s;ee him eat Serpents, but &s;everal who have &s;een him a&s;&s;ured me of it, and it is a thing no body doubts of. I &s;aw al&s;o at <HI>Caire</HI> a <HI>Santo</HI> who had a Turban as broad as a Mill-&s;tone,
<PB N="251" REF="145">
and weighed above half a hundred weight; it was all patched up of &s;everal little pieces of different colours: Every one came and ki&s;s'd his hand with great re&s;pect, the weight of his Turban making him walk very &s;oftly, and with a great deal of Gravity. There are many other &s;orts of <HI>Santo</HI>'s, and in a word, enough in <HI>Aegypt</HI> to man out &s;everal Galleys. The Turks who are nothing near &s;o &s;uper&s;titious as the Arabs, have no &s;uch e&s;teem for them; and formerly there was a Ba&s;ha who &s;ent as many of the&s;e lazy Lubbards as he could find to the Galleys. They have al&s;o dead <HI>Santo</HI>'s to who&s;e memory they bear a &s;ingular Reverence; &s;ome of them are Interr'd upon the High-ways and upon Bridges, and when the Moors find any of the&s;e Sepulchres, they ask leave of the <HI>Santo</HI> who is within, to go that way, or cro&s;s over that Bridge. But I think the chief of the dead <HI>Santo</HI>'s whom they reverence in <HI>Aegypt,</HI> is <HI>Sidi Ahmet el bedoui;</HI> for being at <HI>Caire</HI> on the ninth of <HI>July,</HI> I &s;aw a great many people go to a certain Fair that is kept at a Village called <HI>Meni|tegamr</HI> in the I&s;le or Delta of <HI>Aegypt,</HI> on the &s;ide of the Channel of <HI>Ro&s;&s;etto.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Sidi Ahmet el bedoui.

They &s;ay that at that time, this <HI>Sidi Ahmet el Bedoui,</HI> yearly delivers three Slaves out of <HI>Malta,</HI> and three Moors fail not to be there, and affirm that the night before, they were brought from <HI>Malta,</HI> where they had been Slaves. One day a Turk of Quality, who had been a Slave in <HI>Malta,</HI> went thither, and finding the&s;e Rogues to a&s;&s;ert a Lie with &s;o much boldne&s;s, put &s;o many que&s;tions to them, that he convicted them of the Cheat. They relate a great many vertues of this Helli&s;h Saint, of which it was none of the lea&s;t, that he never knew Woman, only lay with his own &s;he A&s;s They al&s;o tell how this <HI>Santo</HI> having &s;ome priviledge granted him by a Ba&s;ha, and that another Ba&s;ha offering to take it from him, he went on a time to the appartment of that Ba&s;ha, and being brought in before him, told him that he had had that priviledge a long time, and prayed him to let him enjoy it; but finding after much entreaty, that the Ba&s;ha was inexorable, he turned up his cap a little that the point of it might encline to one &s;ide, and &s;aid to the Ba&s;ha, thou wilt not then &s;uffer me to enjoy my priviledge? and the Ba&s;ha an&s;wered him no; then turning his Cap a little more to one &s;ide, thou wilt not then, (&s;aid he to the Ba&s;ha) let me enjoy my priviledge; who replied no; then turning his Cap a great deal to one &s;ide, the Ba&s;ha percei|ved that the Ca&s;tle leaned all to one &s;ide, and was ready to fall, for the Ca&s;tle turned &s;ide-ways proportionally as he had turned his Cap, whereupon the Ba&s;ha in a great fright a&s;&s;ured him that he would pre&s;erve his Priviledge unto him, and prayed him to &s;et the Ca&s;tle upright as it was before, which he did, by &s;etting his Cap by little and little to rights again. They have &s;o much Devotion for that Saint, that when the Caravan of <HI>Mecha</HI> &s;ets out in time of that Fair, many leave the Caravan and Pilgrimage of <HI>Mecha,</HI> and pay their Vi&s;its to that Saint. This devotion la&s;ts a fortnight, and all Per&s;ons Moors, Chri&s;tians and Jews, are &s;uffered to go to that Fair. When they have vi&s;i|ted that Saint, they go to another not far di&s;tant, then to another, and &s;o to four or five; in &s;hort, they &s;pend a Month in the&s;e Devotions.</P>

<P>The Turks having freighted two French Ships with goods in <HI>Alexandria,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">An unlucky bu&s;ine&s;s for the Franks in <HI>Aegypt.</HI></NOTE> the one commanded by Captain <HI>Durbequi,</HI> and the other by Captain <HI>Civilliers,</HI> and one Engli&s;h Ship, to all which they gave a good Freight; Captain <HI>Durbequi</HI> in&s;tead of going to <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> (as he ought to have done) went to <HI>Legorn,</HI> with a de&s;ign to make the be&s;t of his Cargoe; Captain <HI>Civilliers</HI> and the Engli&s;h Captain followed the Example; upon this, Ships dur&s;t not come from Chri&s;tendom to Aegypt, fearing the lo&s;s might be revenged upon them; but in the mean time, the Jews having had advice from <HI>Legorn</HI> that the Ships were arrived in that Port, pre&s;ently acquainted the Ba&s;ha with it, who at that time di&s;&s;embling his Indignation, &s;ent an <HI>Aga</HI> to a&s;&s;ure the Con&s;uls that the Ships of their Countrey were in no Danger, and that they might come as freely and with as much &s;afety as they did before, entreating the Con&s;uls to &s;end this advice into Chri&s;tendom; each Con&s;ul pre&s;ented the <HI>Aga</HI> with a Ve&s;t to the value of fifty Pia&s;tres; for it is a general rule that <HI>Aga</HI>'s never come in Me&s;&s;age to any per&s;on what&s;oever, Con&s;ul or private man, Chri&s;tian or Turk, but they mu&s;t be pre&s;ented according to the merit of the bu&s;ine&s;s, whether good or bad.

concerned in the bu&s;ine&s;s, but they were no &s;ooner come into the Ca&s;tle, when they were &s;ent home again to their Hou&s;es; though for all that, it co&s;t them an hundred <HI>Pia&s;tres</HI> a piece to the <HI>Aga</HI>'s and <HI>Chiaoux,</HI> as a reward for the pains they had been at. The other two Con&s;uls lay &s;everal days in Pri&s;on, nay, and were for the fir&s;t day put in Chains, and at length were not relea&s;ed, till their Nations paid great &s;ums for their liberty, and promi&s;ed the Ba&s;ha to pay within a few Months, the value of the Ships Loadings; for which all the Merchants were obliged under hand and Seal. If the Capitulations made by <HI>Mon&s;ieur de Breves,</HI> were ob&s;erved, &s;uch violences would not be u&s;ed, as I my &s;elf have &s;een practiced by the <HI>Sou&s;-Ba&s;ha,</HI> who &s;ent his Officers one night into the quarter of the French, &s;ome Merchants walking then in the open place, which is at the end of their Quarter, having perceived them coming, retired to their homes, but the Villains pur&s;uing them to the very tops of their Hou&s;es, halled them out, and with all the &s;peed they could dragged them to a na&s;ty Pri&s;on, upon pretext that they had found them abroad at un&s;ea&s;onable hours, for it is prohibited to walk abroad in the &s;treets in the Night-time; but the French are excepted by the Capitulations, which &s;pecifie that the <HI>Sou&s;-ba&s;ha</HI> is not to enter into their Quarter: They ran away with them in all ha&s;te, for fear they might be taken from them; and to make them run the fa&s;ter, each of them was led by two <HI>Cowas,</HI> one holding one Arm and the other the other.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cowas.</NOTE> The&s;e <HI>Cowas</HI> are Moori&s;h <HI>Recors</HI> or Officers, tall &s;trong fellows, who wear no other Cloaths but blew-Shirts, &s;ewed clo&s;e like Womens Smocks; they carry &s;taves as long as them&s;elves, and as big as a Mans Arm; and when they carry any man to Pri&s;on, they give him now and then a blow with their Cudgel, which they hold in both hands by the end, that they may lay on the better. Thus were the&s;e Gentle|men dragg'd away, each of them by two of the&s;e great Devils, who empti|ed their pockets by the way, and pulled even the Rings off of their Fingers: but what was wor&s;t of all, other <HI>Cowas</HI> followed them at the back, who &s;o banged their fides with their poles, that they were forced to keep their Beds for &s;ome days after. In the mean time the other Merchants, who thought that if they let them alone till next day, the Charges would be the greater, went immediately with the Con&s;ul, (though it was eleven a clock at night) to the <HI>Sou&s;-Ba&s;ha,</HI> and pre&s;ented him with a Pur&s;e, in con&s;ideration whereof he relea&s;ed the Pri&s;oners, and let them go home with the re&s;t. Two days after, the Ba&s;ha threatened to Impri&s;on the fame Merchants, under pretext that the Sou&s;-Ba&s;ha's Officers had found them with Women, though it was fal&s;e, and though they could draw no evidence of the matter from &s;ome <HI>Bar|berins</HI> whom the Sou&s;-Ba&s;ha's men found at the &s;ame time in the French Quarter, and purpo&s;ely clap'd into Pri&s;on when they apprehended the French Merchants; however it co&s;t them three Pur&s;es more to take up that affair. <HI>Mon&s;ieur Honore de Bermond,</HI> in who&s;e Family the Con&s;ul&s;hip of <HI>Egypt</HI> continued for many years, had a de&s;ign to remedy all the&s;e Di&s;orders, who being a man of Re&s;olution and very well beloved in that Countrey, purpo&s;ed to rai&s;e his Office to as high a pitch as ever it had been, and for that end, &s;ent his Chief Trucheman to <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> with in&s;tructions to &s;ollicite the <HI>Grand Signior</HI> for &s;everal Orders, and among the re&s;t, for one to have two or three of the chief Jews Hanged before their own Doors in <HI>Caire,</HI> thereby to terrify the re&s;t from putting their tricks upon the French: and another of no le&s;s importance, to wit, that the Jews &s;hould not demand from the French, re|payment of the money they had lent them, becau&s;e they had received double the principal in Intere&s;t, (for they take one <HI>percent</HI> U&s;ury a month, adding the Intere&s;t to the Principal every month, which amounts to con&s;iderable gains, doubling almo&s;t the debt in twenty &s;ix months time.) He &s;pared not Money to accompli&s;h the&s;e things, and would ea&s;ily have obtained them, if <HI>Mon&s;ieur de Begue</HI> had not come at that time, for his coming broke all the others mea&s;ures, bred a confu&s;ion among the Nation, and co&s;t them above three&s;core thou&s;and <HI>Pia&s;tres,</HI> for he promi&s;ed the Ba&s;ha great &s;ums of Money to admit of him to be Con&s;ul, and to &s;end off <HI>Mon&s;ieur de Bermond,</HI> who for &s;ome time was obliged to give way to that violence. Had he obtained the&s;e orders from the Port, they might have contributed &s;omewhat to the prevent|ing

of &s;o many Avanies; but the be&s;t cour&s;e that could be taken, would be, to have the Capitulations made by <HI>Mon&s;ieur de Breves</HI> with <HI>Sultan Amurat,</HI> at that time <HI>Grand Signior,</HI> renewed at <HI>Con&s;tantinople:</HI> It is true, that would co&s;t a round &s;um of Money, for the Turks do nothing <HI>gratis,</HI> but then it would exempt from Indignities, &s;uch as go into tho&s;e Countries, that are remote from <HI>Con&s;tan|tinople,</HI> as <HI>Caire</HI> in <HI>Egypt</HI> is.</P>
<P>When a Frank goes along the &s;treets, you &s;hall have one ra&s;cally <HI>Moor</HI> &s;pit in his face, another give him a blow with a Cudgel, and in the mean time he dares not &s;o much as look them in the face, for fear of a pre&s;ent <HI>Avanie;</HI> for many times after they have beaten a Chri&s;tian, or it may be, given him a &s;tab with a knife, though the Chri&s;tian hath not revenged him&s;elf, they'll go and complain to the <HI>Cady,</HI> &s;aying that the &s;ame Chri&s;tian hath beaten them, and to lift the hand again&s;t a Turk, is a Crime that de&s;erves (with them) the cutting off of the hand; but the matter mu&s;t pre&s;ently be compounded for Money, and the longer it is delayed, the more it will co&s;t; nay, you &s;hall &s;ee a Turk, who ha|ving killed a Chri&s;tian that did him no hurt, go and complain to the <HI>Cady,</HI> that that Chri&s;tian had beaten him, or bla&s;phemed again&s;t the Law of <HI>Mahomet,</HI> which is a Crime for which a Chri&s;tian mu&s;t be burnt, or turn Turk; and though commonly the <HI>Cady</HI> knows very well that all is fal&s;e, yet he &s;till Condemns the Chri&s;tians, that he may get money; and if the party who is &s;o unhappy, have nothing to give, they Charge the Nation with it, and exact it from them by force.</P>

<P>There are likewi&s;e Ra&s;cals, who will inform again&s;t a Chri&s;tian, that they &s;aw him with a Woman, but that they could not apprehend him, becau&s;e he made his e&s;cape, and they want not fal&s;e Witne&s;&s;es for that; if it be a Turki&s;h Woman with whom he is accu&s;ed to have been, he mu&s;t turn Turk, or Burn for it; if it be a Chri&s;tian or Jewi&s;h Woman, the rigour is not &s;o great; but whether Turk, Chri&s;tian, or Jew, that (as any other <HI>Vanie</HI>) is compounded for Money.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, they'll do any thing to &s;uck Money from the poor Franks, obliging tho&s;e who live near to them, even to keep their Windows always &s;hut, preten|ding that they would not have them look upon their Wives, but in reality, to get &s;ome Pre&s;ent from them.</P>
<P>I could make a whole Book of the <HI>Avanies,</HI> which I have &s;een practi&s;ed when I was in that Countrey, but it is &s;ufficient to have mentioned &s;ome, to &s;hew how much the&s;e Ra&s;cals de&s;pi&s;e and in&s;ult over us.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A Greek Pa|triarch in <HI>A|lexandria.</HI></NOTE>I Have but little to &s;ay of the <HI>Greeks</HI> in this place, having &s;poken of them el&s;e|where.

This Patriarch, when he Celebrates, is cloathed in the &s;ame Ve&s;tments as the other Patriarchs are,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ceremonies at the Greeks <HI>Ma&s;s,</HI> on <HI>Ho|ly-Thur&s;day.</HI></NOTE> except that he has a Stole over the&s;e Ve&s;tments, which the others have not, and which was given to a Patriarch of <HI>Alexandria</HI> by a Pope. Over that Stole he wears the <HI>Pallium,</HI> which is bigger and longer than that of the <HI>Latin</HI> Arch-Bi&s;hops; then he puts upon his head a lovely <HI>Tiara,</HI> or Cap of Silver gilt, &s;et thick with fine Pearls, &s;ome of which are pretty big, with many large Rubies, Emeralds, and other &s;uch Precious &s;tones, but it hath not three Crowns, as the <HI>Tiara</HI> of the Popes has. This Cap was pre&s;ented to him by the Duke of <HI>Mu&s;covy,</HI> who is never omitted in all the Prayers of the <HI>Greeks:</HI> It is certainly a very rich Cap, though it come far &s;hort of the riches of the Crown of the Popes, which is kept in the Ca&s;tle of St. <HI>An|gelo.</HI> The Patriarch Celebrates <HI>Ma&s;s</HI> as all other Greek Prie&s;ts do; only after the Epi&s;tle hath been read in Greek, it is al&s;o read in Arabick; it is the &s;ame with the Go&s;pel, and &s;ome other Prayers, which the Patriarch &s;ays aloud in Greek, and then repeats in Arabick.</P>
<P>As to the Communion, when the Patriarch hath con&s;ecrated &s;ome pieces of Bread, then the Wine in a very great Chalice, becau&s;e of the great number of Communicants; he crumbs &s;ome pieces of that Con&s;ecrated Bread into the Chalice, then having publickly asked Forgivene&s;s of all that are pre&s;ent, he Communicates of the Lord's Body; afterwards taking the Cup, and having &s;aid &s;ome Prayers, he &s;ays, <HI>In Name of the Father,</HI> and takes a little of the hallowed Cup; then having &s;aid, <HI>and of the Son,</HI> he takes a little more; and la&s;tly, <HI>and of the Holy Gho&s;t,</HI> he takes a third &s;ip. When that is done, he Communicates the Prie&s;ts, giving each of them the Bread, which they receeive in one hand, and holding the other under to receive any thing that might fall, they go to the &s;ide of the Altar, where after &s;ome Prayers, they ask Forgivene&s;s of the re&s;t, and then Communicate; after that, they go to the Altar, where the Patriarch gives them the Cup at three times, as he took it him&s;elf, &s;aying, <HI>In Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Gho&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>The People Communicate without the Chancel from the hand of a Prie&s;t, who taking the Chalice, goes to one of the &s;ide Doors of the Chancel, where in a gilt Silver-Spoon he gives of the Con&s;ecrated Bread crumbled into the Wine (as I &s;aid before) to all who come to receive; but the truth is, they go to the Communion with far le&s;s reverence than the Latins do.</P>
<P><HI>Ma&s;s</HI> being over, the Patriarch went in the body of the Church, to a place Rail'd in, rai&s;ed about three foot from the ground, at the end whereof there was a Chair for him, and on each &s;ide, &s;ix Chairs, for twelve Prie&s;ts that fol|lowed him; and there being all in Copes, they &s;ate down. The&s;e twelve Prie&s;ts repre&s;ented the twelve Apo&s;tles; then a Prie&s;t went to the Chancel-door, and turning his back to the Altar, read the Go&s;pel for <HI>Holy-Thur&s;day</HI> in Greek: In the mean time, the Patriarch put off his Patriarchal Ornaments, without the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of any, and putting on again his <HI>Tiara,</HI> he tied one Nap|kin about him, and put another by his &s;ide; then &s;etting a great Ba&s;on and Ewer upon the ground, he poured a little Water into the Ba&s;on, making the &s;ign of the Cro&s;s, giving the Ewer to a Clerk, who poured water upon the foot of the fir&s;t of the twelve Apo&s;tles, whil&s;t the Patriarch wa&s;hed and rubbed it well with his hands, then wiped it with his napkin, and offered to ki&s;s it, which the
<PB N="257" REF="148">
Prie&s;t would not &s;uffer. He did &s;o to the re&s;t, pouring always out water for every one of them, with the &s;ign of the Cro&s;s; but when he came to the twelfth, that Prie&s;t (who repre&s;ented St. <HI>Peter</HI>) ro&s;e and made as if he would not &s;uffer the Patriarch to wa&s;h his Feet, in imitation of St. <HI>Peter,</HI> who was unwilling that his Ma&s;ter &s;hould render him that &s;ervice; but at length, after he had &s;poken a little, and that the Patriarch had made an&s;wer, he &s;ate down, as St. <HI>Peter</HI> did, who being told by <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> That he could have no part in the Kingdom of Heaven, if he &s;uffered him not to wa&s;h his Feet, &s;aid, <HI>Not my Feet only, but my al&s;o Head and Hands.</HI></P>
<P>During this Ceremony, nothing was to be heard in the Church, but the groans and lamentations of Men and Women, which were &s;o loud, that they moved even the mo&s;t obdurate almo&s;t, to &s;hed tears al&s;o, and yet the &s;ubject of all this weeping, was, only to &s;ee the Patriarch wa&s;h the Feet of the&s;e Prie&s;ts. After this, the Patriarch put on his Patriarchal Habits again, and the Ewer and Ba&s;on were carried away; then came &s;uch a Croud about him that carried them away, that I thought they would have &s;tifled him, every one &s;trove to dip a Handkerchief into that Foot-laver, and came on &s;o fa&s;t, that before the Clerk had made &s;ix &s;teps, the Ba&s;on was as dry as ever it was. Then the Go&s;pel was read, the Heads whereof the Patriarch explained in a Greek Sermon, and &s;o the Ceremony ended.</P>

<P>THE u&s;ual Puni&s;hments in <HI>Aegypt</HI> are Beheading,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Puni&s;hments in <HI>Aegypt.</HI></NOTE> which they dextrou&s;ly perform: For the <HI>Sous-ba&s;ha</HI> finding a Robber, or any one that looks like &s;uch, &s;ei&s;es him, and making him kneel, one of his Men cuts off his Head at one blow with a Shable, and yet not &s;triking with great force neither; but drawing towards him the Shable, and &s;o u&s;iing the whole length of it, he never fails at the fir&s;t blow to &s;ever the Head from the Body.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Impaling.</NOTE> Impaling is al&s;o a very ordinary Puni&s;hment with them, which is done in this manner. They lay the Malefactor upon his Belly, with his Hands tied behind his Back, then they &s;lit up his Fundament with a Razor, and throw into it a handful of Pa&s;te that they have in readine&s;s, which immediately &s;tops the Blood; after that they thru&s;t up into his Body a very long Stake as big as a Mans Arm, &s;harp at the point and tapered, which they grea&s;e a little before; when they have driven it in with a Mallet, till it come out at his Brea&s;t, or at his Head or Shoulders, they lift him up, and plant this Stake very &s;treight in the Ground, upon which they leave him &s;o expo&s;ed for a day. One day I &s;aw a Man upon the Pale, who was Sentenced to continue &s;o for three Hours alive, and that he might not die too &s;oon, the Stake was not thru&s;t up far enough to come out at any part of his Body, and they al&s;o put a &s;tay or re&s;t upon the Pale, to hin|der the weight of his body from making him &s;ink down upon it, or the point of it from piercing him through, which would have pre&s;ently killed him: In this manner he was left for &s;ome Hours, (during which time he &s;poke) and turning from one &s;ide to another, prayed tho&s;e that pa&s;&s;ed by to kill him, ma|king a thou&s;and wry Mouths and Faces, becau&s;e of the pain he &s;uffered when he &s;tirred him&s;elf, but after Dinner the Ba&s;ha &s;ent one to di&s;patch him; which was ea&s;ily done, by making the point of the Stake come out at his Brea&s;t, and then he was left till next Morning, when he was taken down, becau&s;e he &s;tunk horridly. Some have lived upon the Pale until the third day, and have in the mean while &s;moaked Tobacco, when it was given them. This poor wretch carried the Scales and Weights, of tho&s;e who go about to vi&s;it the Weights, to &s;ee if they be ju&s;t, and he had &s;o combined with &s;uch as had fal&s;e Weights, that he brought fal&s;e ones al&s;o with him; &s;o that the Searchers not perceiving the change of their own Weights, thought the other to be ju&s;t. When <HI>Arabs,</HI> or &s;uch other Robbers are carried to be Empaled, they put them on a Camel, their Hands tied behind their Backs, and with a Knife make great ga&s;hes in their naked Arms, thru&s;ting into them Candles of Pitch and Ro&s;in, which they light, to make the &s;tuff run into their Fle&s;h; and yet &s;ome of the&s;e Rogues go chearfully to Death, glorying (as it were) that they could de&s;erve it, and &s;aying, That if they had not been brave Men, they would not have been &s;o put to death. This is a very common and ordinary Puni&s;h|ment in <HI>Aegypt,</HI> but in <HI>Turkie</HI> it is but very rarely put into practice.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><P>Ordinary In|conveniencies that happen at <HI>Caire.</HI></P>
<P>Heat in <HI>Egypt.</HI> Drink in <HI>Egypt.</HI></P></NOTE>THE fir&s;t Inconvenience to be felt at <HI>Caire,</HI> is the exce&s;&s;ive Heat, which is &s;o intolerable, that one can &s;carcely do any thing, and what is wor&s;e, there is no &s;leeping hardly there in Summer. For when you go to Bed, you'll find the Sheets full of Sand, and &s;o hot, that I think they could not be more, after long warming with a Warming-pan. What you drink there, is commonly as hot as your Blood, for you mu&s;t not think of Ice, Snow, or a Well there; all that can be done, is to put the Water into certain Pots of a white Earth, that Tran&s;pires much, and leave them abroad in the Night-time, having done &s;o, the Water is indeed pretty cold in the Morning; but in the Day-time they put tho&s;e Pots in Windows, which receive any little breeze, and there the Water cools a little, or at lea&s;t lo&s;es &s;omewhat of its heat; and it is a great happine&s;s in that Country, to have a Window that lies well for a breeze, and a <HI>Bardaque,</HI> or Pot, that is Tran&s;pirable. Be&s;ides the&s;e Inconveniencies, there is that of little Flies, or Musketto's, which I reckon the greate&s;t of all. No Man can believe but he who hath felt it by Experience, how unea&s;ie and trouble&s;ome the&s;e In&s;ects are in <HI>Aegypt;</HI> there are always &s;warms of them buz|zing about People, and continually pricking of them, &s;o that they make them&s;elves fat and plump with Man's Blood. There is no other remedy again&s;t the&s;e Gnats, but to have a very fine Cloth all round your Bed, which &s;huts very clo&s;e; and for all that, &s;ome always get in, when you go to lie down.</P>
<P>A pain in the Stomach is very common in that Country, and all New-comers are &s;ubject unto it, who finding them&s;elves in a hot Countrey, leave their Brea&s;t and Stomach open, and will not take Coun&s;el. Neverthele&s;s, the Air (which is &s;ubtile and penetrating) chills their Bowels, and cau&s;es dangerous Fevers and Bloody-Fluxes, e&s;pecially in Autumn when the <HI>Nile</HI> overflows, and therefore one mu&s;t always keep the Stomach warm and well covered. There is another Di&s;temper that reigns there al&s;o, and that is a &s;welling of the <HI>Scrotum,</HI> and to &s;ome (I may &s;peak without Exaggerating) their Cods &s;well bigger than their Head, which is occa&s;ioned by the Water of the <HI>Nile;</HI> and I my &s;elf was troubled a little with it, for the &s;pace of eight days, but then it went away of it &s;elf. To cure this Di&s;temper, they make Inci&s;ion with a Lancet in the &s;welled <HI>Scrotum,</HI> and let out the Water that is got into it. Sore Eyes are very common there, and very dangerous in the Summer-time; that is cau&s;ed by the burning heat of the Sun, which reflects from the Ground upon the Eyes, and &s;corches them, as al&s;o from the Du&s;t, which is very &s;ubtile and &s;alt, and is blown into the Eyes by the Wind, which is the rea&s;on that there are many blind in that Country. Whil&s;t I was in <HI>Aegypt,</HI> a French Merchant lo&s;t an Eye &s;o, and I have known other French troubled with that Di&s;temper, who for a fortnight or three Weeks could not &s;leep, becau&s;e of the &s;harp pain they felt, which made them cry out and roar both Night and Day. In the Summer-time you hardly &s;ee any abroad in the Streets, but who are afflicted with that evil, and carry pieces of blew Stuff before their Eyes, and certainly, you &s;hall find nine of ten whom you meet, with &s;uch de|fen&s;ives before their Eyes: Every one threatned me with that Di&s;temper, and yet (thanks be to God) I never had the lea&s;t touch of it; perhaps, I took care to prevent it, becau&s;e in that bad Sea&s;on, every Morning and Evening I wa&s;hed my Eyes with fair Water, and when I returned from Abroad I did the like, to wa&s;h out any Sand that might have got into them. Pains in the Legs are very bad at <HI>Caire,</HI> and a great many have their Legs &s;wollen to a prodigious bigne&s;s. There is al&s;o another Di&s;temper, or rather inconveni|ence,
<PB N="261" REF="150">
for it is more unea&s;ie than dangerous, which happens when the Water of the <HI>Nile</HI> begins to ri&s;e; there is a kind of Inflammation, or Wild-fire, that runs over the whole Body, which exceedingly torments People by its pricking and &s;tinging; and when you drink to ea&s;e and refre&s;h your &s;elf, whil&s;t you are drinking, and after, you feel &s;uch &s;harp prickings, that you would think there were an hundred Needles &s;tuck into you all at once; the <HI>Provencials</HI> call that <HI>Des Arelles,</HI> and it is an Inconvenience that la&s;ts almo&s;t three Months.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Arelles.</NOTE> In <HI>March,</HI> 1658. after &s;ome days of high Winds, a certain Di&s;temper broke out, which began with a Head-ach and Fever, and continued with a great Rhume: The Fever la&s;ted not above two or three days at mo&s;t, but it ren|dered Men &s;o feeble, that all the Limbs &s;eemed to be broken, and if Pre&s;erva|tives were not u&s;ed, the Patients relap&s;ed into a Fever, that held them three Weeks of a Month, all in <HI>Caire</HI> from the highe&s;t to the lowe&s;t, both Aged and Young were &s;ei&s;ed with it, and there was nothing to be heard every where but Coughing; this Di&s;temper was &s;o contagious, that it infected by the Breath. They called it <HI>Abou Chamaa,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Abou Chamaa.</NOTE> becau&s;e of a certain Song made &s;ome Months before, which began with <HI>Abou Chamaa,</HI> and ended with <HI>Ha, ha, ha.</HI> Now &s;eeing that Di&s;temper cau&s;ed great Coughing, it was thought every one &s;ung <HI>Ha, ha, ha;</HI> wherefore the Ba&s;ha prohibited the &s;inging of that Song with &s;o much Rigour, that when the Sous-ba&s;ha found any one &s;inging it in the Streets, though it had been but a Child, he ordered him to be laid down and Ba&s;to|nadoed; becau&s;e they fancied that the Song was the cau&s;e of the Di&s;temper, which &s;pread &s;o far, that afterwards we learnt at <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> and in other Places about, that they had been troubled with it at the &s;ame time, nay, the Cor&s;airs who took us, had all had it at that time. I was told at <HI>Caire,</HI> that ten Years before, &s;uch another Di&s;temper had raged there, which they called <HI>Maka&s;&s;a,</HI> that made tho&s;e who were troubled with it, think all their Limbs to be broken; and they were Cured by eating of Oranges, which made them &s;o dear at that time, that an Orange was worth half a <HI>Piastre,</HI> &s;o long as that Di&s;ea&s;e la&s;ted. Once every &s;even Years they have a Plague in <HI>Aegypt,</HI> making (during that time) the Circuit of the Turki&s;h Empire, and yet it had been there a little before I came, two Years one after another, &s;weeping away each Year, (as I was told) an Hundred thou&s;and Souls.

<P>HAving Sojourned a pretty while in <HI>Aegypt,</HI> and found no Company to Tra|vel with farther, &s;ome other Con&s;iderations likewi&s;e prompting me, I re&s;olved to return into <HI>Christendom.</HI> I took the occa&s;ion of a great Engli&s;h Ship, called the <HI>Recovery,</HI> which lay at <HI>Bouquer,</HI> ready to &s;et &s;ail for <HI>Legorn;</HI> there were good French Ships at <HI>Alexandria,</HI> where I might have been very well Accommodated. But for greater Security, I cho&s;e rather to go in an Engli&s;h Ship, becau&s;e the Engli&s;h were at that time in Peace with tho&s;e of <HI>Barbary.</HI> I al&s;o cho&s;e that Pa&s;&s;age, as having a great de&s;ire to &s;ee <HI>Tunis,</HI> where that Ship was to touch, to land Don <HI>Philippo,</HI> with &s;everal other Barbary Men who were on Board of her; and becau&s;e I had got a pretty familiar Acquain|tance of him during this Voyage, I think it will not be ami&s;s to give here a &s;hort view of his Hi&s;tory, according as I had it from him&s;elf by pieces, and a certain <HI>Sicilian,</HI> who had waited upon him ever &s;ince he arrived in <HI>Sicily.</HI></P>
<P>Don <HI>Philippo,</HI> who&s;e Turki&s;h name is <HI>Mahomet,</HI> is the Elde&s;t Son of the late <HI>Dey Ahmet,</HI> fourth <HI>Dey</HI> of <HI>Tunis,</HI> who was a very au&s;tere Man, but yet fond of this Son, that was the Elde&s;t of &s;everal other Boys he had. This Prince <HI>Ma|homet</HI> being very young, was made General of the Galleys of <HI>Bi&s;erta,</HI> and made an Expedition with them; after which, (being as yet but &s;eventeen or eighteen years of Age) his Father Married him to the Daughter of the Ba&s;ha of <HI>Tripoly,</HI> again&s;t his Inclination, who loved not the Lady, though &s;he was very Beautiful; but he was forced to Di&s;&s;emble, for fear of provoking his Father, who was &s;o violent a Man, that his Anger was always Fatal. The Marriage was Celebrated with all imaginable Magnificence, and for the &s;pace of three days, there was nothing but Fea&s;ting, Plays, Tilting, and other Di|ver&s;ions, the Father &s;paring no Charges in Celebrating the Solemnity of the Wedding. In the mean time, though this Prince was greatly Re&s;pected, yet he re&s;olved to quit all his Hopes, and e&s;cape into a Country where he never had been, and was unknown; he carried on his De&s;ign &s;o cunningly and &s;e|cretly, that nothing of it was &s;u&s;pected till he was gone. Pretending one day to go take the Air in &s;ome place beyond <HI>Goletta,</HI> he went into a little Boat with four or five Chri&s;tian Slaves, and &s;ome <HI>Moors,</HI> to row them. When he was pa&s;t the <HI>Goletta,</HI> and got a pretty way from it, he put a&s;hoar &s;ome of his <HI>Moors</HI> upon pretext of &s;ending them for &s;omething, and then going off to Sea, and a little after, making a &s;ign to the Chri&s;tians, that it was now time for them to declare them&s;elves, and begin; he &s;hot one of the <HI>Moors</HI> that remained with an Arrow; and the Chri&s;tians a&s;&s;i&s;ting him, all the re&s;t were quickly killed, or forced to leap into the Sea, of whom &s;ome &s;wam a&s;hoar. They then directed their Cour&s;e towards <HI>Sicily,</HI> and &s;ucceeded &s;o well in it, that in two days time they arrived at <HI>Mazara.</HI> The Vice-Roy of <HI>Sicily</HI> was no &s;ooner informed of it, but he &s;ent for the Prince to <HI>Palermo,</HI> where he was lodged in the Profe&s;s-Hou&s;e of the Je&s;uits, and being there in&s;tructed in the Chri&s;tian Religion, he was afterwards Bapti&s;ed in the Cathedral Church, by the Arch-Bi&s;hop of <HI>Palermo,</HI> the Vice-Roy being God-Father, and the Vice-Queen God-Mother, who named him <HI>Don Philippo.</HI> He went from thence to <HI>Rome,</HI> where he was well received and much honoured by the Pope, who gave him good Pre&s;ents. He went to <HI>Spain,</HI> where the King allowed him a Pen&s;ion, and re|tiring to <HI>Valentia,</HI> he fell in love with a Spani&s;h Lady, of no great Fortune, but very Witty, who played very well on the Lute, and Sung to admiration (which was enough to engage the Prince, who is a pa&s;&s;ionate lover of Mu&s;ick) he Married her privately, and was at &s;ome Charges about it. In the mean time the King of <HI>Tunis</HI> being informed that his Son was fled into Chri&s;tendom, fell into &s;uch a Rage, that he put about twenty to Death, Slaves and others, and among the re&s;t, the unfortunate Wife of this Prince <HI>Mahomet,</HI> (whom for
<PB N="264" REF="152">
the future we &s;hall call <HI>Don Philippo</HI>) whom he cau&s;ed to be &s;trangled, as ha|ving favoured the flight of his Son. But then, it being out of his Power to Cha&s;ti&s;e his Son in Per&s;on, he Di&s;inherited him, leaving him not &s;o much as one Farthing. Now the Mother of <HI>Don Philippo,</HI> who was no le&s;s afflicted for the lo&s;s of her Son, (whom &s;he pa&s;&s;ionately loved) bethought her &s;elf of all ways how &s;he might recover him, and prevailed &s;o far with an Engli&s;h Captain, that he promi&s;ed to bring him back. This Traytor in execution of his de&s;ign, came to <HI>Valentia,</HI> where having &s;oon got acquaintance of this Prince, he found that he wanted Money, and &s;upplied him. <HI>Don Philippo</HI> ha|ving got Money, made an Equipage, and &s;oon &s;quandered away two or three Thou&s;and Crowns, that were lent him. But &s;ome time after, the Captain de|manding payment of his Money, put the Prince to a great plunge: He offer'd the Captain a Letter to his Mother, who would pay him all that he had Bor|rowed of him; but the Captain would not have it. Saying, That he was no more owned in that Country, now he was turned Chri&s;tian, but that he advi|&s;ed him to return to <HI>Rome,</HI> where he had been well received, that his Holi|ne&s;s would &s;till receive him in the &s;ame manner, and quickly put him in a condition to repay him; offering him at the &s;ame time to carry him thither in his Ship. The Prince embraced the offer, and taking his Wife and &s;ome Chri&s;tian Servants on board with him, put to Sea; but the Captain in &s;tead of directing his Cour&s;e toward <HI>Rome,</HI> &s;tood away for <HI>Tunis,</HI> &s;o that the Prince was all in amaze when he knew <HI>Goletta.</HI> He had had intelligence in <HI>Sicily</HI> of the death of his Father, and therefore finding him&s;elf betrayed, he made a Vertue of Nece&s;&s;ity; and writing a Letter privately to &s;ome Friends that he had at <HI>Tunis,</HI> he &s;ent it a&s;hoar by &s;ome of the Ships Company, who &s;ecretly brought him an an&s;wer. He acquainted tho&s;e his Friends with his arrival, and asked their advice what way he &s;hould enter <HI>Tunis.</HI> They &s;ent him back an an|&s;wer, That they would come next day with a Brigantine, and carry him away as by force. Wherefore next Morning he went out in the Ships Boat, that he might go Fi&s;h near the &s;hoar, and took with him the <HI>Sicilian</HI> I mentioned be|fore, who hath always &s;erved him. This Man, who was made believe that they were ca&s;t upon <HI>Tunis</HI> by foul Weather, would have di&s;&s;uaded him from that Fi&s;hing, telling him that he might be known: But he an&s;wered, That he was &s;o much altered, that he did not at all fear that, for he had now been &s;everal Years ab&s;ent. They were no &s;ooner got off from the Ship, but a Brigantine full of Armed Men came up towards them, who having fired &s;ome &s;hot in the Air, entred the Boat, and with great re&s;pect &s;aluted the Prince. But the poor <HI>Sicilian</HI> (who &s;teered the Boat) was much &s;urpri&s;ed, not knowing what to do. Immediately they were carried to <HI>Tunis,</HI> where being arrived, <HI>Don Philippo</HI> went to &s;ee the <HI>Dey</HI> fir&s;t, and then his Mother; who expected him with great impatience. The <HI>Dey</HI> ordered him, as a Puni&s;hment for his flying into Chri&s;tendom, to walk through the Town in the Spani&s;h Apparel he then wore, &s;o that he was a Laughing-&s;tock to all the People; but if he had not had good Friends, he had lo&s;t his Head for his flying. After he had &s;een his Mother, they put him into Turki&s;h Apparel: But when they came to cut off his Hair (which was very lovely and long) he told me, he had much ado to con&s;ent to it, and thought that he could more willingly have &s;uffered Death, than parted from his Hair. Neverthele&s;s, having &s;ent for direction from his Confe&s;&s;or concerning the matter: His Confe&s;&s;or &s;ent him this Re&s;olution, That the Chri|&s;tian Religion con&s;i&s;ted not in Hair, and that therefore he &s;hould &s;uffer it to be cut off. Then he &s;ent for his Wife to <HI>Tunis,</HI> (&s;he being with Child) but he had much ado to pre&s;erve his Servants liberty; for the <HI>Dey</HI> and <HI>Aga</HI> of the <HI>Divan,</HI> would have had them made Slaves, neverthele&s;s they retained both their Liberty and Religion. Two years after, he would have &s;ent his Wife back again into Chri&s;tendom, but they would not &s;uffer him; however after many difficulties, &s;he went away attended by a Servant of the Princes, leaving a Son behind her, and came to <HI>Genoa,</HI> where &s;he put her &s;elf into a Nunnery, and hath &s;ince continued.</P>
<P>Now <HI>Don Philippo</HI> having been Di&s;inherited by his Father, had nothing to Live on but what he had from his Mother, who is very fond of him: Nor is he put into any Place, becau&s;e they &s;till believe him to be a Chri&s;tian, there
<PB N="265" REF="152">
being none great nor &s;mall in <HI>Tunis,</HI> but knew him by the name of <HI>Don Philippo;</HI> for my part the fir&s;t time I went to his Hou&s;e when I was at <HI>Tunis,</HI> having asked for the Hou&s;e of <HI>Don Philippo,</HI> every body told me the way to it.</P>
<P>Now to di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;s them of the belief they have that he is &s;till a Chri&s;tian at Heart, he re&s;olved &s;ome years after his return, to undertake the Pilgrimage of <HI>Mecha,</HI> and &s;o wheadled a Brother of his own, that he engaged him in the Journey, who bore <HI>Don Philippo</HI>'s Charges and his Sons, whom he took with him. So &s;oon as he came to <HI>Caire,</HI> he made acquaintance with the Franks, and then hired a Hou&s;e in the quarter of the French, where he came two or three times a week to drink Wine and make merry with the Franks; and the time being come that the Caravan parts for <HI>Mecha,</HI> he travelled thither in company of the <HI>Megrebins,</HI> and upon his return, the occa&s;ion of this Engli&s;h Ship pre&s;enting, he re&s;olved to return by Sea to <HI>Tunis.</HI></P>
<P>This Prince is a tall and hand&s;ome well &s;haped Man, and was not then above thirty years of Age, he has a great deal of wit, and &s;peaks Italian and Spani&s;h naturally well. He is a lover of Mu&s;ick, and therefore has &s;everal Slaves, who played &s;ome on the Harp, others on the Flute and Lute. His Son was then a little Boy about &s;even years old, hand&s;ome and witty, like his Father.</P>
<P>This &s;ame <HI>Don Philippo</HI> for all he is &s;o poor, makes his Brothers &s;o &s;tand in fear of him, that there is none of them dares to look him in the Face.</P>

For our parts being five in company, to wit, three <HI>Mar&s;eille&s;e,</HI> my &s;elf and my man, we provided all things for our&s;elves.</P>
<P>We took Boat then on <HI>Thur&s;day</HI> the thirtieth of <HI>January,</HI> to go on board the Ship, which was at <HI>Bouquer,</HI> (but not before we and our Goods had been &s;earched at the Cu&s;tome-hou&s;e) where we were encompa&s;&s;ed with an Army of Rogues that begged &s;omething of us, and to &s;ay the truth, it is no ea&s;ie matter, for a Stranger to Embark there, for there are &s;o many of the&s;e Ra&s;|cals to whom &s;ome <HI>Maidins</HI> mu&s;t be given, that one is quite Stunned with them.

<P>From the <HI>Farillon</HI> or Block-hou&s;e, we went &s;treight to <HI>Bouquer,</HI> where we arrived about &s;ix a Clock at Night, but it blew &s;o hard, that we dur&s;t not go a board the Ship; &s;o that we put a-&s;hoar and lodged in a Coffee-Hou&s;e, keeping our Boat with us, for there was none to be found there, and that was the rea&s;on we came by Sea, and not over Land, knowing very well that we &s;hould find no Boats there; be&s;ides it is more convenient and cheaper

<P><HI>Bouquer</HI> is a Ca&s;tle built upon a point of land,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Bouquer.</NOTE> that runs out a little into the Sea.

<P>The Ca&s;tle has in it a great many Soldiers, commanded by a Muteferaca, but it does not &s;eem to be well provided of Cannon; for while I was at <HI>Caire, Papachin</HI> a famous Cor&s;air, came with Spani&s;h Colours and took both an Engli&s;h and a French Ship, that had put them&s;elves under the protection of its &s;hot, the Ca&s;tle firing only two Guns; but the <HI>Aga</HI> was made Man&s;oul for it. It has &s;ome Guns however, and two among the re&s;t, whereof the one has the Arms of France, and the other of <HI>Mar&s;eilles;</HI> the Turks, (who are very bad Hi&s;torians) &s;ay that they are as old as St. <HI>Louis,</HI> who left them at <HI>Mon&s;our</HI> near to <HI>Damiette.</HI></P>
<P>There is about a &s;core of Hou&s;es near to this Ca&s;tle, and a little farther off, as many more; but the French are not &s;uffered to water at <HI>Bouquer. Friday, Saturday</HI> and <HI>Sunday,</HI> there blew &s;o violent a North wind, that on <HI>Friday</HI> night or <HI>Saturday</HI> Morning a Dutch Ship, called the <HI>Soldatero,</HI> was ca&s;t away in the port of <HI>Alexandria:</HI> The evening before, that di&s;a&s;ter hap|pened, the <HI>Aga</HI> of the Block-hou&s;e, &s;ent word to the Captain of that Ship, that he &s;hould have a care of him&s;elf, that he thought his Ship made too much travel, and that he had be&s;t put out another Anchor, but he &s;lighting the advice, and his Cables firing in the night-time, the &s;hip &s;truck again&s;t the Rocks, with &s;o much Violence, that &s;he broke into &s;mall bits no bigger than ones hand, (as <HI>Don Philippo</HI> who &s;aw it told me) and eight Men Per|i&s;hed.</P>
<P>The &s;ame night, a Ship of <HI>Me&s;&s;ina</HI> which arrived at <HI>Bouquer</HI> two days before, broke her Cables, and having quickly got under Sail, to &s;ave her &s;elf, was forced in by the Storm, near to <HI>Madia,</HI> not without danger of being wracked there, for it is almo&s;t at the Mouth of the <HI>Nile,</HI> where there is no Water for a Ve&s;&s;el of any Burthen. Our &s;hip had al&s;o &s;ome &s;hare in the danger, occa&s;ioned by that Storm, for &s;he lo&s;t two Cables, and &s;aved only one that held out; The chief Mate al&s;o going in the Evening to the head, to &s;ee if it was not like to Fire, was thrown over Board, but five and twenty or thirty Ropes being immediately thrown out to him, he caught hold of &s;ome of them, and &s;o was pulled in. The Captain would have reckoned his Ship as good as lo&s;t, if that Mate had been ca&s;t away, for he confided much in him, and indeed, he was a skilful Sea-man. In &s;hort, if that Cable had given as the other two did, the Ship mu&s;t unavoidably have been lo&s;t, for they had not one good Cable more, having lain three or four Months at an Anchor.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. LXXXVI.</HI> Our departure from <HI>Bouquer,</HI> and our getting on Board the Ship.</HEAD>
<P><HI>MOnday</HI> the third of <HI>February,</HI> the Wind flackening a little, (though it blew &s;till a &s;trong gale from We&s;t) we went into our boat and put out from <HI>Bouquer</HI> about eight a Clock in the Morning: In a good hours time we came to the Ship, and immediately after <HI>Don Philippo</HI> came. This &s;hip carryed thirty Guns, of which the greate&s;t eighteen pound Ball, the &s;maller twelve Pounders, except two little Bra&s;s pieces in the Cuddie, which carried but five pounders a piece.</P>
<P>There were two of the&s;e Guns in the &s;teerage, which were charged with Bunches of Grapes, that is to &s;ay, clu&s;ters of little leaden Bullets, &s;plit in the middle, that yet &s;tick all together, but when they are &s;hot, &s;catter into &s;o many pieces: In this place there were two port-holes to run out the Guns, if the &s;hip were attacked, and came to a clo&s;e Fight: &s;o that there being two al&s;o in the Fore-ca&s;tle, and two more in the Cuddie, charged in the fame manner, they would &s;o &s;cower the Deck fore and aft, that I believe if two hundred men &s;hould have come on Board, they would all have had their &s;hare.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Scopa Coperta.</NOTE> The&s;e Guns in the Streights are called <HI>Scopa Coperta,</HI> that is to &s;ay, a covered Broom, and when they fire them, they ring a little Bell, that tho&s;e of the &s;hips company who are at the other end of the &s;hip, may fall flat on their Bellies, and receive no hurt.</P>
<P>Our &s;hip had &s;ixty four men a board, &s;he was very great, had fair large Cabins, and two Decks. In the lower Deck they had a very convenient Pump; it is an Iron-Chain in form of a Chaplet, that reaches down to the Sink, having little pieces of Leather about half as long as ones hand, and &s;ome|what hollow, and fa&s;tened to it at every half foots di&s;tance; this is turned by two Handles, one on each &s;ide, and it is incredible how much water it will rai&s;e; in&s;omuch, that if a &s;hip were full, &s;he might be emptied by &s;uch a Pump in two hours time. So &s;oon as we were come on Board, we hired every one of us a Cabin to lye in; for my part I hired one for &s;ix Crowns upon the Deck in the Ships Wa&s;t. The&s;e Cabins are like pre&s;&s;es made along the &s;hip &s;ide: I put my quilt into mine, and crept into it by a little hole, but being within, I neither felt cold nor the to&s;&s;ing of the Ve&s;&s;el, for I was in the middle of the Ships length. There were &s;o many &s;uch Cabins in this Ship, that not only the Officers, but all the Sea-men likewi&s;e, had every one his Cabin; &s;ome al&s;o lay in Hammocks, made fa&s;t to the Deck above, which is very commodious, for let the Ship to&s;s never &s;o much, it is not to be felt in the&s;e Hammocks which hang always perpendicular. The Engli&s;h are very good Sea-men, and ob&s;erve excellent order on board their Ships, not di&s;mayed at all at bad Weather, and &s;o exact in keeping account of the &s;hips way every day, that during all our Voyage, I never knew them &s;ix miles out in their reckoning. They mea&s;ure the Ships way with a Log or little flat and very thin piece of Wood tied to a line, and when they throw it into the Sea, they turn a half minute Sand-Gla&s;s, (there being an hundred and twenty of them in an hour) and then drop the Log from the Stern, letting the line run off, till the Gla&s;s be out; then they pull in the line and reckon how much of it hath been in the water, every &s;even fathom of the line making a mile in an hour; this they did every time the Wind encrea&s;ed or abated, never grudging their labour, and the four Mates were always pre&s;ent when they heaved the Log, who after it was done, went to their &s;everal Cabins, and &s;et down how much the &s;hip had run, for every one of them keeps a Journal. This is very u&s;eful to know how far the &s;hip is from Land, and to prevent running a-&s;hoar in the Night-time; in
<PB N="271" REF="154">
&s;hort, the Engli&s;h are very expert in that. That which only di&s;plea&s;ed me in this Voyage, was the great number of Candles, that were lighted in the Night time betwixt Decks, and in the Cabins, for there were above thirty Barbary Men on board who had been at <HI>Mecha,</HI> and were returning into their own Country; all the&s;e Men lay upon the lower Gun-Deck, (there being a rank of Beds on each &s;ide, and a pa&s;&s;age in the middle betwixt them) and had all their lighted Lamps &s;tuck to the Deck, and burning in the Night-time, which made me always extremely afraid the Ship might be &s;et on fire; and be&s;ides that, &s;ince the lea&s;t glip&s;e of light, is in the Night-time &s;een a great way off at Sea, I was apprehen&s;ive it might have directed &s;ome Cor&s;air, or &s;ome Ship of the Venetian Fleet towards us: For I had &s;marted already, and knew very well what Blades they were, nay more, I fancied that they were not careful enough in &s;moaking their Tobacco. However they told me &s;till, that there was no danger in what I feared.</P>

<P><HI>T&V;e&s;day</HI> the fourth of <HI>February,</HI> the Pur&s;er who was &s;till at <HI>Alexandria,</HI> came on board with &s;ome Provi&s;ions, and then having taken in our Boats, we &s;et &s;ail from <HI>Bouquer. Wedne&s;day</HI> the fifth of <HI>February,</HI> we &s;teered our cour&s;e North, with an ea&s;ie We&s;t-wind; it was a calm in the Evening, but in the Night it blew hard from We&s;t, with &s;everal &s;torms of Rain and Wind, which la&s;ted till next day at Noon, <HI>Thur&s;day</HI> the &s;ixth of <HI>February:</HI> All that while we bore away North-north-we&s;t, in the Evening the Wind &s;hifted about to North-we&s;t, and la&s;ted till next day the &s;eventh of <HI>February,</HI> when after Noon the Wind turning North-north-we&s;t, we tackt and &s;tood away We&s;t-&s;outh-we&s;t, lea&s;t the Wind might force us too near the I&s;le of <HI>Rhodes.</HI> The night following the Wind &s;lackned, and <HI>Saturday</HI> the eighth of <HI>February,</HI> we were becalmed from Morning till Noon, when we had a little Gale from South; then we &s;teered away We&s;t-north-we&s;t, but the Wind la&s;ted not. After that (to our great trouble) we were becalmed for &s;everal days. <HI>Saturday</HI>-night, or <HI>Sunday</HI>-morning, the &s;ixteenth of <HI>February,</HI> there fell a great deal of Rain, which la&s;ted till day, when we were &s;till becalmed, and about eleven a Clock in the Morning, with a breeze of Wind from We&s;t-north-we&s;t, we &s;tood away South-we&s;t, the Wind blowing fre&s;her in the evening until Midnight; du|ring that time, we tackt and &s;tood away towards the I&s;le of <HI>Candia,</HI> and the Night being very dark, we ran &s;o far till we &s;aw a Light clo&s;e on Head, which the Men could not di&s;cern whether it was a&s;hoar, or in a &s;mall Pinnace, which in the day-time we &s;aw making for <HI>Candia;</HI> at length, for fear of &s;tri|king on Ground, they tackt about again before Midnight, bearing away South-we&s;t. <HI>Monday</HI> the &s;eventeenth of <HI>February,</HI> after Midnight the Winds &s;o chopt and changed, that we had all &s;orts of Winds, and about Morning it blew &s;o hard from We&s;t-north-we&s;t, that we were forced to furl all our Sails, except the Main-&s;ail, and tye the Helm to Mid&s;hips; this Wind brought with it many &s;torms of Rain, that la&s;ted not long. About one a Clock after Noon it Hailed, which changed the Wind to the North, but &s;eeing it blew harder than it had done in the Morning, we could not carry high Sails, but continued the &s;ame Cour&s;e. If the Wind had not been &s;o violent, we would have &s;teered our Cour&s;e We&s;t-north-we&s;t: This Wind la&s;ted till <HI>Tue&s;day</HI> the eighteenth of <HI>February,</HI> when about an hour before day it &s;lackened a little, and then we &s;pread our Fore-&s;ail, the Wind being &s;till too high to carry our Maintop-&s;ail, however we &s;tood away We&s;t; the Wind abating a little after,

we &s;pread our Maintop-&s;ail, and &s;hortly after that, the Mizzain and Foretop-&s;ail: After noon the Wind chopt about to North-we&s;t, and blew &s;o fre&s;h, that we were forced to furl our Foretop-&s;ail, and &s;teered away We&s;t-&s;outh-we&s;t, till <HI>Wedne&s;day</HI> Morning, the nineteenth of <HI>February,</HI> when the Wind changing to North-north-we&s;t, we put abroad our Foretop-&s;ail again, and &s;tood away We&s;t, and a little after, we &s;pread all our Sails. About two hours after day we made Cape <HI>Ra&s;axarra,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ra&s;axarra.</NOTE> in <HI>Barbary,</HI> and &s;tood in within almo&s;t thirty Miles of it; it is a very low Land, then we tackt about again towards the <HI>Gozo</HI> of <HI>Candia.</HI> About two hours before night we were becalmed, and about two hours after Night was in, we had the long look'd for Ea&s;t Wind, but it was ea&s;ie; however with it we &s;teered our cour&s;e We&s;t-north-we&s;t until <HI>Thur&s;day</HI> Morning, the twentieth of <HI>February,</HI> when after a little Rain that fell, the Wind chopt about to South-&s;outh-ea&s;t, whil&s;t in the mean time we made all &s;ail, and &s;tood away North-north-we&s;t; a little after, we turned our Ships-head to We&s;t-north-we&s;t, running above eight Miles an hour upon a Wind, which we would have continued to do, had we not been afraid to have been embeyed within a bad Gulf,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hihal.</NOTE> called <HI>Hihal,</HI> that runs out into the Sea, and therefore we &s;tood away before the Wind, till we had weathered it; all this while the Fore-&s;ail and Sprit-&s;ail did us no &s;ervice. We ran at a great rate in this man|ner for the &s;pace of three hours, then the Wind turned We&s;t, which brought us a Flurry, with a great &s;cud of Rain, for half a quarter of an hour, but the main Wind was ea&s;ie enough, and with it we bore away North-we&s;t; in the evening the Wind fre&s;hened a little, and we &s;teered the &s;ame Cour&s;e, till about ten or eleven a Clock at Night, that we tackt and &s;tood away South-we&s;t. About midnight we had a &s;udden gu&s;t of Wind, with Hail and Rain, which was &s;o violent, that it laid the Ship on her &s;ide, and if &s;he had been a &s;mall Ve&s;&s;el, would certainly have over&s;et her; it tore the Main-&s;ail in pieces, and blew &s;o very hard, that the Sea-men could not furl their Sails, but at length all Hands coming aloft, they made a &s;hift to furl them, till the &s;torm was over. They &s;aw the Flurry a coming, and then they &s;hould have minded their Sails, &s;o that we needed not to have feared any damage, but through Lazine&s;s, they let them alone, &s;aying, that perhaps it might pa&s;s over them. In fine, we &s;pent the Carnaval in this manner, dancing more than enough, in &s;pight of our Teeth, and without Mu&s;ick. When the &s;torm was over, we &s;pread all our Sails, and tackt about again Northwards, with the &s;ame We&s;t-north-we&s;t Wind, until <HI>Friday</HI> the one and twentieth of <HI>February,</HI> that the Wind turning South-we&s;t, we bore away We&s;t-north-we&s;t, till after Dinner, that the Wind got into the North-north-we&s;t, and we &s;tood away We&s;t. This la&s;ted till <HI>Saturday,</HI> the two and twentieth of <HI>February,</HI> when we were becalmed, and in the Evening the Wind turned North-we&s;t and by we&s;t, but an ea&s;ie Gale, and we &s;teered South-we&s;t till <HI>Sunday,</HI> the three and twentieth of <HI>February,</HI> that the Wind turned Northerly, but &s;o gently, that it look'd like a Calm, and we &s;teered our cour&s;e We&s;t-north-we&s;tward; we were after|wards becalmed until Evening, when we had an ea&s;ie North-ea&s;t Gale, which fre&s;hened a little in the Night-time, and in &s;tead of &s;teering away We&s;t (which was our Cour&s;e) we &s;tood away North-north-we&s;t, to bear in with the Gulf of <HI>Venice,</HI> where we hoped to have found a North-wind, that would have carried us &s;treight to <HI>Tunis.</HI> We kept that Cour&s;e till <HI>Tue&s;day,</HI> the five and twentieth of <HI>February,</HI> when the Wind blew &s;o hard, that we made nine or ten Miles an hour, always North-we&s;t, for fear of being carried to far to the Leeward, and lo&s;ing the Wind: This Wind la&s;ted all <HI>Wedne&s;day,</HI> the twenty &s;ixth of <HI>February,</HI> and <HI>Thur&s;day</HI> morning, the twenty &s;eventh we made <HI>Malta,</HI> which we left to the Starboard, running betwixt <HI>Tripoly</HI> and <HI>Malta,</HI> leaving <HI>Lampedo&s;a</HI> and <HI>Lino&s;a</HI> to the Larboard;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lino&s;a.</NOTE> <HI>Lino&s;a</HI> is about &s;eventy Miles di&s;tant from <HI>Malta.</HI> We &s;aw them not, becau&s;e we pa&s;&s;ed them in the Night-time.

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. LXXXVIII.</HI> Of <HI>Lampedo&s;a</HI> and <HI>Pantalaria.</HI> Of &s;everal Cor&s;airs we met with, and our Arrival before <HI>Goletta.</HI></HEAD>
<P><HI>LAmpedo&s;a</HI> is a little I&s;le, or Rock of &s;mall Circumference,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lampedo&s;a.</NOTE> about an hun|dred Miles di&s;tant from <HI>Malta.</HI> It is an I&s;land that produces nothing, and is only inhabited by Coneys; but becau&s;e there is good Water upon it, and a good Harbour, Ships put in there for Fre&s;h-water. In that I&s;le there is a little Chappel, wherein there is an Image of the Ble&s;&s;ed Virgin, which is much Re|verenced both by Chri&s;tians and Infidels, that put a&s;hoar there; and every Ve&s;&s;el always leaves &s;ome pre&s;ent upon it. Some Money, others Bisket, Oyl, Wine, Gun-powder, Bullets, Swords, Mu&s;quets, and in &s;hort, all things that can be u&s;eful even to little ca&s;es; and when any one &s;tands in need of any of the&s;e things, he takes it, and leaves Money or &s;omewhat el&s;e in place thereof. The Turks ob&s;erve this practice as well as the Chri&s;tians, and leave Pre&s;ents there. As for the Money no body meddles with that, and the Galleys of <HI>Malta</HI> go thither once a year, and take the Money they find upon the Altar, which they carry to our Lady of <HI>Trapano</HI> in <HI>Sicily.</HI> I was told that &s;ix Chri&s;tian Ships having &s;ome time &s;ince put into that Port, and that when they had watered, the Wind offering fair, they all &s;ailed out of the Port, except one, which having &s;et &s;ail with the re&s;t, could not get out; at which the Ma&s;ter was &s;trangely &s;urpri&s;ed. However, taking patience, he waited for another more favourable Wind, which offering, he attempted to get out again, but as yet he could not, which &s;eemed very &s;trange to him; and therefore he re&s;olved to make a &s;earch in his Ship, whereby he found that one of his Soldiers had &s;tollen &s;omething in that place; which being carried back again, he made &s;ail, and got ea&s;ily out of the Harbour. Many Miracles are wrought in that place, at the inter|ce&s;&s;ion of our Ble&s;&s;ed Lady, which are not &s;o much as doubted of, neither by Chri&s;tians nor Turks. We pa&s;t that I&s;land then, with the &s;ame Wind, which la&s;ted till <HI>Friday</HI> the eight and twentieth of <HI>February,</HI> when we were becalm|ed about three a Clock in the morning, the Wind leaving us pretty near <HI>Pantalaria.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Pantalaria</HI> is a little I&s;land, about twelve or fourteen Miles in Circuit; it is di&s;tant from <HI>Malta</HI> about an hundred and thirty Miles, and is fruitful in Wine, Fruits, and Cotten. It belongs to the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> who keeps a Spani&s;h Governour in it, that lives in the Ca&s;tle; which (as the Turks told me) is &s;o &s;trong, that two hundred Galleys could not take it. About two a Clock in the Afternoon, we had a Gale at North-north-ea&s;t, and we &s;tood away We&s;t. About three in the Afternoon, we made two Ships to the Windward, which bore down upon us with full &s;ail; they were got already &s;o near us, that we wondred we had not made them &s;ooner. We made ready to receive them the be&s;t way we could, in the &s;hort times warning we had. Immediately we launched our two Boats, then cleared the Gun-Deck, of Che&s;ts, Hamocks, and of all incumberances, that our Guns might have freedom to play, &s;o that in a trice, the Deck look'd like a great Hall; all the Goods and Baggage were laid aloft on the Poop, and upon the upper Deck, but betwixt the Ma&s;ts, that they might not hinder the execution of our Guns, <HI>Scopa Coperta.</HI> The Main|yard was chained to the Main-ma&s;t, all the great Guns loaded, every one took his Mu&s;quet and Bandileers, and all with &s;o much expedition, that by that time they were got within Cannon &s;hot of us, we were ready. The headmo&s;t Ship put out Red Colours, and then all took them for Spaniards, becau&s;e we were &s;o near <HI>Sicily.</HI> For though we perceived the Turki&s;h Colours, yet we knew that Cor&s;airs have all &s;orts of Colours on board, and put out many times fal&s;e ones, that they may the more ea&s;ily &s;urpri&s;e. We put out Engli&s;h Colours, which they &s;aluted with a Gun without &s;hot, and we an&s;wered the
<PB N="272" REF="156">
like. Being come within Mu&s;quet &s;hot, we heard their Trumpets &s;ounding French Levets, which made the Turks who were on board of us, take them for Ships of <HI>Tunis;</HI> being come nearer, they again &s;aluted us without a Bullet, which we did not an&s;wer, only furled our Main-&s;ail, to &s;hew them that we re&s;olved to Fight, and not to Run for it. We were then on board in all an hundred and fifty Men, and expected to &s;pend the Night in fighting and not &s;leeping, for the Sun was &s;et, and we had no Light but from the Moon, which &s;hone out very clear. Our Mate hailed them from the Poop, and demanded who they were? Who having an&s;wered, They were Friends. The Mate then called to them,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The meeting of two Ships of <HI>Tunis.</HI></NOTE> That if &s;o, they &s;hould fall to the Leeward; which they did, &s;ailing &s;o near our Stern, that our Turks ea&s;ily &s;poke to them. And having asked who they were? They an&s;wered, they were Ships of <HI>Tunis.</HI> An Engli&s;h Renegado, called <HI>Solyman Reys,</HI> commanded them, and they belonged to the <HI>Dey.</HI> The bigge&s;t and be&s;t Sailer of the two Ships, carried thirty &s;ix Guns, and the other which was le&s;s, five and twenty, having each two hundred Men on board. When they knew that the Prince <HI>Don Philippo</HI> was on board of us, they &s;aluted him with three Guns, and our Captain ordered the &s;alute to be rendred, but to the Windward, becau&s;e all our Guns were loaded with Shot, and the&s;e Gentlemen were to the Leeward of us, the Gunner fired two Guns to the wind|ward, but the third mi&s;&s;ing fire, he ran in all ha&s;te to that which was neare&s;t, (without con&s;idering what he did) and it happening to be to the Leeward, and they ju&s;t off and on with us, he fired it, and &s;hot a Bullet into the middle of the bigge&s;t Ships &s;ide. This put our Captain into a great Pa&s;&s;ion again&s;t the Gunner, who ran away and hid him&s;elf: Immediately they came on board of us in their Boat, and complained highly of that Action, demanding him who had fired the Gun, to be delivered unto them; becau&s;e they &s;aid they had a Man killed, and two wounded by the &s;hot. Which we believed to be fal&s;e: Becau&s;e one &s;aid, one man Killed, and two wounded; another, two Killed; another, two wounded; and another, three. Our Captain told them, That it was an Accident, and that many times Ships upon their entring into a Port, intending to &s;alute the Town, have by Inadvertency, &s;hot Bullets into the place. But they &s;till per&s;i&s;ting in their demand, he told them, That if they would needs have him, they &s;hould go on board their Ship again, and then come and take him. Which perhaps they might have attempted, had we not had Turks on board, who would have &s;uffered for it. For it was an Article in their Peace, that he that fir&s;t &s;hot a Bullet, broke the Peace. When they found that there was nothing to be done, they drank a Cup or two, and returned to their Ship, giving us two Letters for <HI>Tunis.</HI> After that, they bore away Ea&s;tward, and we held on our Cour&s;e till towards Midnight that we tackt about, but then the Wind turning We&s;t,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Cape</HI> Bon.

<P><HI>Saturday</HI> the fir&s;t of <HI>March,</HI> we tackt, and leaving the Ca&s;tle of <HI>Galippa</HI> to the Leeward, bore away North-we&s;t, but the Wind chopping into the North, which blows full from <HI>Tunis,</HI> we &s;tood away We&s;t-north-we&s;t, and coming clo&s;e up with the Ca&s;tle of <HI>Galippa,</HI> (which is a &s;mall &s;quare Ca&s;tle upon a Hill) we left it to the Leeward, and then tacking again, bore away Ea&s;t-north-ea&s;t, that we might al&s;o weather Cape <HI>Bon,</HI> and &s;o get where we de&s;ired to be. We kept beating in this manner a pretty while, the Current carrying us always off of Cape <HI>Bon,</HI> and the &s;ame day had &s;ower gu&s;ts of Wind and Rain.</P>
<P><HI>Sunday</HI> Morning the &s;econd of <HI>March,</HI> we made a Cor&s;air near to <HI>Pantalaria,</HI> whom we waited for without breaking our Cour&s;e, and &s;o &s;oon as he was come within Ma&s;quet &s;hot of us, we halled up our Main &s;ail, he putting out Red Colours, and we the Engli&s;h. Then he came under our Stern, and we infor|med our &s;elves that a Turk, called <HI>Ahmet Reys,</HI> commanded the Ship that be|longed to private Men of <HI>Tunis.</HI> She was a &s;mall Ship, that two years before had been taken by them from a Captain of <HI>Mar&s;eilles,</HI> &s;he carried then four|teen Guns, and had about two hundred Men on board; having &s;aluted one another each with a Gun, we &s;teered on our &s;everal Cour&s;es.</P>
<P><HI>Monday</HI> Morning the third of <HI>March,</HI> we had another kind of Allarm, when a Seaman on the Maintop-ma&s;t head cried, he &s;aw four Sail, which proved only to be Rocks; that day we began to &s;ail farther upon a Tack, to wit, from

<HI>Pantalaria</HI> to <HI>Sicily,</HI> and were got very near to it in the Evening, when we Tackt about and &s;tood back again for <HI>Pantalaria.</HI> We had &s;o bad Luck, that when the Wind was fair, &s;ome Cor&s;air or other, made us lo&s;e the occa&s;ion of it for doubling the Cape, for then we mu&s;t make ready to Fight, and by that time they knew us to be Friends, the Wind was gone. Or otherwi&s;e, when we were in one place, a Wind offered that would have been very good for us if we had &s;tayed where we were the day before; and when the Wind was good, we had a high Sea on head, as on <HI>Tue&s;day</HI> the fourth of <HI>March,</HI> when with a North-wind, we were got above twenty Miles to the Windward of Cape <HI>Bon,</HI> but making no way forward, (becau&s;e of a high Sea we had on head) we found our &s;elves in the Evening to the Leeward of the &s;aid Cape, and tacked about for <HI>Sicily;</HI> from whence &s;tanding off again, next day the fifth of <HI>March,</HI> and with the &s;ame North-wind bearing We&s;t-north-we&s;t, we were got &s;o far to the windward of Cape <HI>Bon,</HI> that we were in hopes to have weathered it; but a high Sea on Head, the Current and contrary wind drove us &s;o to the Lee|ward, that being within a League of the &s;aid Cape, we could not double it, though we wanted but a little of having done it. We therefore &s;tood off again to|wards the Ea&s;t-north-ea&s;t. <HI>Friday</HI> night and <HI>Saturday</HI> morning, the &s;eventh of <HI>March,</HI> we had &s;torms of Rain, and all &s;orts of Winds, and yet were &s;o for|tunate, that in the Morning we found our &s;elves forward enough in our Cour&s;e to have doubled the Cape. The &s;ame Morning we had the Wind at North-ea&s;t, which made us bear away We&s;t-north-we&s;t, and fre&s;hening a little, put us in hopes of doubling the Cape, but half an hour after, it &s;hifted about to the We&s;t, and that made us bear away South-we&s;t: An hour after, it chopt about to North and by Ea&s;t, and blowing pretty fre&s;h, we made all the Sail we could, &s;tanding away We&s;t-north-we&s;t, and &s;o about two a Clock in the Af|ternoon, with much joy we doubled Cape <HI>Bon,</HI> called in Turki&s;h <HI>Kara Bouroun,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Kara Bouroun.</NOTE> having been eight days beating about it, all the while with We&s;t-north-we&s;t, and North-winds. Our Mates told us, that they were always a long time in doubling that Cape, and &s;ometimes &s;pent three Weeks about it. About five a Clock in the Evening, we Sailed betwixt the I&s;le of <HI>Zimbre,</HI> and an I&s;le or Rock, that is almo&s;t mid-way betwixt the Main-land and <HI>Zimbre.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Zimbre.</NOTE> <HI>Zimbre</HI> is Inhabited, has convenient Anchorage by it, and good Water in it.

During the&s;e &s;torms, a Moor on board of us died, who had been ill of a Bloody Flux, almo&s;t ever &s;ince the beginning of our Voyage, and next morning he was thrown over-board. At length, on <HI>Saturday</HI> the eighth of <HI>March,</HI> about &s;even a Clock in the Morning, we came into the Port, or rather the Road of <HI>Goletta,</HI> for it is not a Harbour, but a Road that lies open to the South ea&s;t Wind; and in all <HI>Barbary,</HI> there are but two good Ports, to wit, <HI>Porto Farina,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Porto Farina.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Goletta.</NOTE><HI>GOletta</HI> is no more but two Ca&s;tles, whereof the one was built by the Emperour <HI>Charles</HI> the fifth, and the other by <HI>Ahmet Dey</HI> the Father of <HI>Don Philippo,</HI> who perceiving that the Galleys of <HI>Malta</HI> came and took &s;hips in the Road, without any damage from the Guns of the Ca&s;tle, built this la&s;t, which is very low, and has &s;even or eight great Gun-holes two foot above the Water, by which the Guns play level with the &s;urface of it. This Ca&s;tle is round on the &s;ide next the Sea, and that of <HI>Charles</HI> the fifth is almo&s;t &s;quare; Between the&s;e two Ca&s;tles there are three Hou&s;es, one belonging to the Family of <HI>Don Philippo,</HI> the other to the Bey, and the other to <HI>Schelebi</HI> the Son of <HI>Hi&s;ouf Dey,</HI> who is called barely <HI>Schelebi,</HI> becau&s;e he was Born during the time his Father Reigned.</P>
<P>When we had refre&s;hed our &s;elves a little in the Hou&s;e of <HI>Don Philippo,</HI> we took Boat and went to <HI>Tunis,</HI> by the Canal or rather Lake, which in the begin|ning is very narrow, there being many Canes fixed all round in the bottom of the Water, for catching of Fi&s;h, afterwards it grows very wide. It is not commonly above five &s;pan deep in Water, then it was very &s;hallow, and had many dry places in it, which with the lea&s;t Wind are quickly covered, and that very high with Water.</P>
<P><HI>Don Philippo</HI> went by Land with his company mounted on a &s;tately Hor&s;e that was brought him. The fir&s;t thing we &s;aw upon that Water, was a Hill to the left hand very near the Sea-&s;ide, where there are natural Baths of Water almo&s;t boyling hot: There is a <HI>Bagnio</HI> built there, and it is called <HI>Hamarmulf;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Hamarmulf. Zagouam.</NOTE> then a little further on upon the &s;ame &s;ide, they &s;hewed us a high Hill called <HI>Zagouam,</HI> which is a great way from this Lake, and a days Jour|ney di&s;tant from <HI>Tunis,</HI> there there is a little Town of <HI>Tagarins,</HI> or <HI>Andala|ous,</HI> called al&s;o <HI>Zagouam.</HI></P>
<P>When the Chri&s;tians po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed that Countrey, there were Aqueducts that brought Water from thence to the City of <HI>Carthage;</HI> at pre&s;ent they are broken, but &s;ome Arches with the Fountains and Ci&s;terns &s;till remain to be &s;een. As we came near to <HI>Tunis,</HI> we &s;aw a great many Olive-Trees, and abundance of other Trees, which denote a good Countrey. In four hours time we arrived at <HI>Tunis,</HI> though with a little wind they go it many times in two hours, but we were many times imbayed.</P>
<P>By Land it is eighteen miles from <HI>Goletta</HI> to <HI>Tunis.</HI> If they plea&s;ed, they might make a good Port at <HI>Tunis,</HI> but then the Town would not be &s;o &s;trong, or at lea&s;t not &s;o &s;ecure. From the place where you Land, it is a mile &s;till to the Town, where being arrived, we went to lodge at the Hou&s;e of <HI>Mon&s;ieur Le Vacher,</HI> a Peri&s;ian Prie&s;t, and Father of the Mi&s;&s;ion, who was then Con&s;ul for the French, and he received us very Affectionately.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. XC.</HI> Of the Countrey-Hou&s;es and other places that are to be &s;een about <HI>Tunis.</HI></HEAD>
<P>TWO days after our arrival, <HI>Don Philippo</HI> &s;ent for us to &s;hew us a Coun|trey-Hou&s;e he had half a League from the Town. The Countrey about <HI>Tunis</HI> is full of the&s;e Countrey Hou&s;es, which are built like the <HI>Ba&s;tides</HI> about <HI>Mar&s;eilles. Don Philippo</HI>'s is very pretty, it is built in form of a &s;quare Tower, and higher than any about it; from the Hall to the top of the Tower, there are an hundred and eleven &s;teps up, and from thence there is an excellent Pro&s;pect, which di&s;covers on all hands a lovely Plain reaching out of &s;ight, full of Olive-Trees. In it there is a great Hall open above with covered Galleries round it, which have the Roof &s;upported by &s;everal Pillars. In the middle of this open place, there is a great re&s;ervatory of Water, which &s;erves for &s;everal Water-works. All this place is adorned with Marble, as al&s;o all the Halls and Chambers, which are beautified with Gold and Azure, and very plea&s;ant Plai&s;ter-work, there being Fountains every where, that play when one plea&s;es. One &s;hould al&s;o &s;ee the <HI>Bardes,</HI> which are three Hou&s;es built by the Bey for his three Sons, a League from <HI>Tunis.</HI> This Bey is as it were the Ba&s;ha's Farmer, to whom he gives &s;o much of the Revenue due to the <HI>Grand Signior</HI> in the Countrey, which he gathers, and the re&s;t he keeps to him&s;elf. He was not at that time Bey, but Ba&s;ha, and his elde&s;t Son was Bey. In the&s;e Hou&s;es there are a great many Fountains with lovely Ba&s;ons of one entire piece of Marble, brought from <HI>Genoa;</HI> and as in the Hou&s;e of <HI>Don Philippo,</HI> an open Hall, with a great re&s;ervatory in the mid|dle, and walks all round it, roofed over, and &s;upported by &s;everal Pillars; this, as al&s;o all the Rooms, are paved with black and white Marble, adorned with Gold and Azure, and that kind of Clay or Plai&s;ter-work. There are &s;everal fair appartments in all the&s;e Hou&s;es, which have lovely Gardens full of Orange and &s;everal other Fruit-Trees, planted in as good order as in Chri&s;tendom, with many neat Beds and borders of Flowers at the ends of Walks, all made by Chri&s;tian &s;laves. The&s;e Hou&s;es are called <HI>Bardes,</HI> from the More&s;co word <HI>Berd,</HI> that &s;ignifies Cold, becau&s;e there is a fre&s;h Air about them. Near that place, there is an Aqueduct built by a <HI>Dey,</HI> which brings Water four or five miles off to <HI>Tunis.</HI> A few &s;teps from that, there is ano|ther Aqueduct &s;omewhat older, yet &s;till modern, which is parallel to the former, and carries Water al&s;o to <HI>Tunis.</HI> Another day I went to &s;ee the <HI>Cantre,</HI> which belongs to <HI>Schelebi,</HI> whom I mentioned,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cantre.</NOTE> the Son of <HI>Hi&s;ouf Dey,</HI> and is four leagues from <HI>Tunis.</HI> As you go thither, you pa&s;s by the old Aqueducts of <HI>Carthage,</HI> which are about half way; they are at that place very entire &s;till, rai&s;ed high, and built of very great &s;tones. From <HI>Tunis</HI> to the Cantre mo&s;t of the way is over large Fields planted with Olive-Trees, &s;ome &s;teps di&s;tant from one another, but in &s;o &s;treight a line, that they look like Walks, which would be very plea&s;ant, were it not that the&s;e ways are always full of Rain-water and mire, as all the Countrey about <HI>Tunis</HI> is, becau&s;e it lyes upon a level. We came then to the Cantre, &s;o called from a Bridge, which <HI>Hi&s;ouf Dey,</HI> the Father of <HI>Schelebi,</HI> built over a River called <HI>Magerda,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Magerda.</NOTE> for Cantre in <HI>More&s;co</HI> &s;ignifies Bridge. This River <HI>Magerda</HI> is neither very broad nor rapid, but enough to de&s;erve the name of a fair River; it runs near to the Hou&s;e of <HI>Schelebi,</HI> and his Father built a &s;tone Bridge to cro&s;s over it, the &s;paces betwixt the Pillars of the &s;even Arches, being built up from the bottom to the &s;urface of the Water, with huge pieces of Free-&s;tone; &s;o that the water pa&s;&s;ing through the Arches, and finding it lower on the other &s;ide, makes at every arch a very plea&s;ant Ca&s;cade two foot high, where the Water falls with a great noi&s;e. Upon that River there are &s;everal Iron-Mills,
<PB N="276" REF="158">
as al&s;o for grinding Corn, and fulling the Caps called Fez-Caps, which are made at <HI>Zagouaro</HI> by <HI>Tagarins.</HI> All that work in the&s;e Mills are the &s;laves of <HI>Schelebi.</HI> At the end of the Bridge is the Hou&s;e of <HI>Schelebi,</HI> built in form of a Ca&s;tle; it hath one very large Court and other &s;maller ones; the Rooms (as in other Hou&s;es) are beautified with Gold, Azure, and Plai&s;tering, with Fountains every where, and all paved with Marble; &s;o that they are more magnificent than tho&s;e I had &s;een before. There are lovely Pictures in tho&s;e Rooms, for formerly this <HI>Schelebi</HI> was very rich, his Father having left him a va&s;t E&s;tate, and among other things eighteen hundred Slaves, but he hath run out a great deal in his Debaucheries; he is a man of a generous Heart, and if he were once in Chri&s;tendom, he would never leave it again. He keeps open table for all Franks that come to &s;ee his Hou&s;e, and is &s;o cour|teous, that he never refu&s;es any thing, and if he have not what is asked from him, he u&s;es means to procure it at any rate, that he may freely give it. When I went to his Hou&s;e, he was not there, for he was then at <HI>Tabarque,</HI> a little I&s;land in the Kingdom of <HI>Tunis,</HI> within a Mu&s;quet &s;hot of the main Land, but three days Journey from <HI>Tunis.</HI> That I&s;land belongs to the <HI>Genoe&s;e,</HI> who have a very good Fort, and drive a great trade there, and among other things, in Hor&s;es, which are called <HI>Barbes.</HI> The <HI>Schelebi</HI> was gone thither to buy Timber for building of a Galley. About three Leagues from the <HI>Cantre,</HI> there is a place called <HI>Tabourbe,</HI> where there are &s;ome ancient ruines, and chiefly an ancient Temple, but I went not to &s;ee it, becau&s;e then I mu&s;t have lain there, or at the <HI>Cantre,</HI> and I had not time to &s;pare, for our Captain put us in hopes daily that he would &s;ail next day. That was the rea&s;on al&s;o that I went not to <HI>Suze</HI> neither, which is a long days journey from <HI>Tunis,</HI> it is the place where there are more Antiquities than any where el&s;e in the Kingdom of <HI>Tunis,</HI> and I believe that thereabouts there are ruines of Churches and other things, relating to St, <HI>Augu&s;tin,</HI> to be &s;een.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. LXXXXI.</HI> Of <HI>Tunis,</HI> and of the Slaves that are there.</HEAD>
<P><HI>T&V;NIS</HI> the Capital City of the Kingdom, of the &s;ame name, lyes in a Plain; it is pretty big, and the Hou&s;es are indifferently well built, though they make no &s;hew, but they are all Marble, Gold and Azure within. The Suburbs of this City are as big as the City it&s;elf, which is all paved, but dirty as heretofore <HI>Paris</HI> was, &s;o that after rain, there is hardly any going in the Streets. There is a Ca&s;tle upon an Eminence within the Town, which commands it, and it makes a very pretty &s;hew: There are &s;ome Guns before the Gate, and the front of it looks well, which is all that I could &s;ee of it, nor indeed dur&s;t I eye it attentively; for I had warning given me, that it was dangerous for Chri&s;tians to be curious in viewing that Ca&s;tle. I pa&s;t by it then, but very fa&s;t, and hard by over again&s;t it there is a Burying-place. Not far frem the Ca&s;tle there is <HI>Bazar</HI> for Drapers; it is a long broad &s;treet with &s;hops on both &s;ides, all which have the fore part &s;upported by four Pillars, two on each &s;ide; none but Drapers keep &s;hop there; but there are &s;everal other Bazars al&s;o for other Commodities.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Baths for Slaves at <HI>Tunis.</HI></NOTE>There are thirteen Baths in <HI>Tunis,</HI> where all the Slaveslodge, except tho&s;e that are kept in their Ma&s;ters Hou&s;es, and (as &s;everal Slaves told me) there may be there in all ten or twelve thou&s;and Chri&s;tian Slaves, who carry every one a great ring of Iron at their foot,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Knights of <HI>Malta</HI> at <HI>Tunis</HI></NOTE> but the Knights of <HI>Malta</HI> have be&s;ides that a huge Iron-Chain above five and twenty pound weight, which is fa&s;tened to the Ring, that Chain is very trouble&s;ome to them, for they mu&s;t either turn it quite round their Leg and make it fa&s;t there, which is
<PB N="277" REF="158">
very heavy when they walk, or hang it by a hook that they have by their &s;ide, which commonly gives them a pain in the &s;ide, or el&s;e mu&s;t carry it on their Shoulders. In the&s;e Baths there is a great Hall where they are &s;hut up in the Night-time, there they lodge as well as they can, &s;ome having little Rooms made of wood, to which they go up by Ladders, and are &s;towed three or four together in one, the re&s;t lye upon the Ground, but all horridly bad, for being very numerous, and lock'd in in the Night-time, they do their needs where they are in Pots, which rai&s;es a noy&s;ome &s;tench; be&s;ides when one has a mind to &s;leep, &s;ome fall a talking, and others a quarelling and fighting, making con&s;tantly a hideous din, which &s;eems to me a Hell upon Earth.</P>
<P>In the morning this Pri&s;on is opened, and tho&s;e that are to work, are let out, who are conducted to their Labour by men that take care of it; they are employed in building and other works of that nature; and I have known Knights of <HI>Malta</HI> of noble Families there, who have been made &s;erve as Labourers, &s;ome carrying Sand and others Stone, and they were thus u&s;ed to oblige them to ran&s;om them&s;elves the &s;ooner, and at the higher rate. They who can get any thing by their own indu&s;try, pay &s;o much a day to their Ma&s;ter, and &s;o are not forced to work. Many of them keep taverns, and the&s;e live the be&s;t of all, for they get money, and work not, but yet they mu&s;t give their Ma&s;ter part of their Profit. None but &s;laves &s;ell Wine at <HI>Tunis,</HI> it is all white, and grows in great plenty in the Countrey about, but they put Lime to it to make it intoxicate. They &s;ell their Wine cheap, and it is the cu&s;tome, that if you go to a Tavern and call for a quart of Wine, they will &s;et Bread before you, and three or four di&s;hes of Meat or Fi&s;h, with Sallads and other appurtenances, and when you are to go, you only pay for the Wine, and at a rea&s;onable rate too; be&s;ides, the&s;e Slaves have power to beat the Turks if they are rude and in&s;olent in their Taverns, and to pull of their Turban and keep it till they have payed their reckoning, if they refu&s;e to do it.</P>
<P>The Slaves who neither work nor gain any thing, cannot &s;tep out of the Bath, without leave from the Keeper thereof who gives them a man to wait on them, to whom they ought (at lea&s;t) to give three pence for his pains, and he is to an&s;wer for them. Our Knights were of the Number of tho&s;e la&s;t, for having written to <HI>Malta</HI> that they were forced to work, the Turks that were &s;lave at <HI>Malta</HI> were &s;everely Ba&s;tonadoed, who immediately wrote to <HI>Tunis,</HI> that if they continued to make the &s;laves of <HI>Malta</HI> work at <HI>Tunis,</HI> they would be Cudgeled to death in <HI>Malta,</HI> and &s;ince that time, they are no more put to work.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. LXXXXIII.</HI> Of the Puni&s;hments which are in &V;&s;e at <HI>Tunis.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE Puni&s;hments u&s;ed at <HI>Tunis,</HI> differ according to the quality of the Per|&s;ons. When a Turk in pay de&s;erves Death, he is Executed in a Cham|ber, and not Publickly. They make him &s;it down in a Chair, and two Chri|&s;tian Slaves pulling each an end of a Cord, that is put about his Neck, quickly &s;trangle him. The Turks of mean condition, or <HI>Moors,</HI> are Hanged upon the out&s;ide of the Walls; they &s;et them upon the Wall, put about their Neck a Halter, made fa&s;t in a hole purpo&s;ely made in the Wall, and then pu&s;hing them down, they are al&s;o &s;oon di&s;patched. As for Maids or Women, that have de&s;erved Death, they choak them in the Oaze by the Sea-&s;ide, putting their Head into it, and a Man &s;etting his Foot upon their Neck. They have other very cruel Puni&s;hments for the Renegadoes, that turn Chri&s;tians again: They wrap them up in Pitched Cloth, put a Cap of the &s;ame upon their Head, and then make a Fire round them. Or otherwi&s;e they put them to a crueller Death: For they wall them up &s;o, that there is nothing but their Head with|out the Wall, and having rubbed over their Head and Face with Honey, leave them &s;o expo&s;ed for three days, and as many nights, to the di&s;cretion of the Flies, which pain them to Death within le&s;s time. The Slaves are puni&s;hed with Ba&s;tonadoes, or they cut off their Ears or No&s;e, according to the qua|lity of the Offence. But if a Slave kill his Ma&s;ter, or any other Turk, they break his Legs and Arms, then tie him to a Hor&s;es Tail, and after they have dragged him &s;o about the Town, &s;trangle him, giving the Body to the Franks to be Buried; but mo&s;t commonly the Boys take him from the Executioner, (as they did a French Man a little before I came to <HI>Tunis</HI>) for there are no wickeder Boys in the World, than in that Town. They &s;natcht that dead Body out of the Executioners hands, in &s;pight of the <HI>Mezoar,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Mezoar.</NOTE> who is the Officer whom in Turky they call the <HI>Sou&s;-ba&s;ha</HI>) and having dragged him about for &s;ome time longer; they Roa&s;ted him a little with Straw, which they kindled under him, and then threw him into the Ditch, out of which the French afterwards took him, and buried him in their Burying Place, called St. <HI>Anthony;</HI> for the Engli&s;h have one by them&s;elves. When I was at <HI>Tunis,</HI> the Franks lived &s;everally, in the Hou&s;es which they Hired; but they were a Build|ing a pretty commodious <HI>Oquele,</HI> where they mu&s;t all Lodge with their Con|&s;uls, as in other places of the <HI>Levant.</HI></P>

<P>AT length our Captain having done all his Bu&s;ine&s;s, and the Wind offer|ing fair, it was time for us to leave <HI>Tunis.</HI> We parted from thence on <HI>Wedne&s;day,</HI> the &s;ix and twentieth of <HI>March,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Carthage.</NOTE> about eleven a Clock in the Morn|ing, and went by Land on Hor&s;e-back, that we might &s;ee &s;omewhat of <HI>Car|thage.</HI> We went clo&s;e by the Ruines of it, which are above three Leagues from <HI>Tunis,</HI> and there &s;aw the remains of &s;tately Aqueducts, which conveyed
<PB N="280" REF="160">
water from <HI>Zagouan</HI> to <HI>Carthage,</HI> many of the Arches whereof are &s;till &s;tand|in the Road to the <HI>Cantre,</HI> as we &s;aid before. The Ruines of <HI>Carthage</HI> &s;ignifie but little, being only heaps of Stones, and &s;ome places under Ground, where there are great Ci&s;terns; nay, from the&s;e Ruines they daily carry away Marble and other Stones, for their Buildings in <HI>Tunis,</HI> and the Country Hou&s;es about. We came to the Sea-&s;ide, about three a Clock in the Afternoon, and being got on board, we &s;tayed &s;till there all that day, becau&s;e our Captain had &s;ome Bu&s;ine&s;s to do with him that Commanded at <HI>Goletta,</HI> concerning the dues that he is to have from every Ship. Next morning, <HI>Thur&s;day</HI> the &s;even and twentieth of <HI>March,</HI> we &s;et &s;ail with a good South-ea&s;t Wind, &s;teering away North-north-we&s;t; but about Noon the Wind &s;lackened a little, and the night fol|lowing it turned Northerly, which made us put back again to the Road of <HI>Goletta,</HI> where we arrived on <HI>Friday</HI> the twenty eighth of <HI>March,</HI> about ten a Clock in the morning.</P>
<P><HI>Saturday</HI> the nine and twentieth of <HI>March,</HI> the Wind veered about to North-ea&s;t, and the night following we had all &s;orts of Winds: At length, <HI>Sunday</HI> the thirtieth of <HI>March,</HI> we had a gentle Gale from South-we&s;t, and an hour after day we &s;et &s;ail, &s;teering our cour&s;e North, but about ten a Clock we were becalmed, and about Noon it blew a breez from North, which within an hour after changed to North-ea&s;t, and an hour after that to Ea&s;t; &s;o that we &s;till kept on our Cour&s;e. Two hours within Night, the Wind turned South-&s;outh-we&s;t, and we &s;tood away North-north-ea&s;t.</P>
<P><HI>Monday</HI> morning, the one and thirtieth of <HI>March,</HI> we were becalmed, and continued &s;o till <HI>Tue&s;day,</HI> the fir&s;t of <HI>April,</HI> when about ten a Clock in the Morning, we had a &s;mall Gale from North-we&s;t, and we &s;teered away We&s;t, towards <HI>Sardinia.</HI> In the Evening, two hours after Sun-&s;et, the Wind turned Ea&s;terly, and we &s;tood our Cour&s;e again North-north-ea&s;t; in the night-time we had a calm, which la&s;ted all next day, <HI>Wedne&s;day</HI> the &s;econd of <HI>April:</HI> However, it always blew a little breez, &s;ometimes one way, &s;ometimes ano|ther, though the Sea was &s;till &s;mooth and calm. In the Evening, from the Maintop head, we made a Sail off of <HI>Sardinia,</HI> which followed its Cour&s;e, as we did ours Northward, with a gentle Gale from Ea&s;t. We were becalmed in the night-time, and continued &s;o till next day, the third of <HI>April,</HI> when about nine in the morning, it blew a breez from South-we&s;t, which within half an hour after, changed into a &s;tronger Gale from Ea&s;t; and we continued our cour&s;e Northwards. We had a calm again about Noon, which la&s;ted till next day, <HI>Friday</HI> the fourth of <HI>April,</HI> when about eight a Clock in the morning, it blew a gentle South-ea&s;t Gale, which about Noon turned full South, and about three or four a Clock next morning, it blew a good fre&s;h Gale from We&s;t; half an hour after, we di&s;covered a <HI>Polaque</HI> a-&s;tern, and clo&s;e up with us, which made very quick way. We called to him <HI>Alarga,</HI> and turned all out and &s;tood to our Arms. At length he &s;ailed by to the Windward, within a Pi&s;tol &s;hot of us, which our Captain ob&s;erving commanded a Broad&s;ide to be fired at him, but the chief Mate di&s;&s;uaded him, telling him that if he was a Cor&s;air, his Con|&s;orts (who probably could not be far off) would hear the noi&s;e of the Guns, and &s;o come up with us; in the mean time, he made very great way. Here|upon various Judgments pa&s;t: Some &s;aid they were Spaniards, who would have &s;urpri&s;ed us. Others, that it was one of the <HI>Polaques,</HI> that Trade betwixt <HI>Le|gorn</HI> and <HI>Sardinia</HI> for Chee&s;e, and &s;uch like Commodities, and carrying but three or four Men, they might have been a&s;leep, and &s;o did not &s;ee our Ship. But mo&s;t part thought it was a Prize taken by the Barbary-men, which they &s;ent into <HI>Barbary;</HI> &s;eeing when they pa&s;&s;ed by us, they called <HI>Cbaban,</HI> who was <HI>Reys</HI> of a <HI>Tunis</HI> Man of War then out at Sea, taking our Ship (perhaps) for <HI>Chaban Reys</HI> his Ship. About three a Clock in the morning, we pa&s;&s;ed <HI>Sardinia,</HI> and all that we could &s;ee of the Land, for two days &s;pace that we &s;ailed along the Goa&s;t of it, were only very high Mountains. And now we were got into the entry of the &s;treight that is betwixt <HI>Sardinia</HI> and <HI>Cor&s;ica;</HI> there the wind blew &s;o fre&s;h, that we made above &s;even Miles an hour, which was a great deal for &s;uch a heavy Ship as ours. We kept our Cour&s;e &s;till Northward, and about ten a Clock in the Morning made <HI>Monte Chri&s;to,</HI> a little after <HI>Elba,</HI> and on the other &s;ide <HI>Cor&s;ica,</HI> and then we &s;teered North-north-we&s;t About eleven a Clock in
<PB N="281" REF="160">
the Forenoon, the Wind changed to South-we&s;t, and blew pretty hard, and about that time we made a Sail, which &s;trove to get the Wind of us; about Noon he was got to the Windward, and being within Cannon &s;hot, put out Engli&s;h Colours, and we did the like; but he &s;till bearing down upon us, we halled up our Main-&s;ail, and waited for him. When he was come up with us, our Men knew it to be a Flemi&s;h Pinck, commanded by an Engli&s;h-man, who had bought it. He told us that he came from <HI>Legorn,</HI> and was bound for <HI>Tunis,</HI> that the <HI>Palaque</HI> we met was a Prize, taken by a <HI>Caraveue,</HI> and Bark of <HI>Tunis,</HI> that were Con&s;orts; that he had met with them, but that he had &s;een no Spani&s;h Ship, which much rejoyced us. After that, he drank our Captains health, and fired a Gun, which our Captain having an&s;wered, he went his way, and we followed our Cour&s;e. The Wind &s;lackened much in the Afternoon, and about five a Clock in the Evening, we made two Sail near the Land of <HI>Cor&s;ica,</HI> which &s;trove for the Wind of us. We thought they had been the two Barbary men they told us of, however we &s;tood upon our Guard. About &s;ix a Clock at night, we were almo&s;t becalmed, and we di&s;covered Fires a-&s;hoar in <HI>Cor&s;ica,</HI> which (as I think) they made becau&s;e of tho&s;e two Cor&s;airs. About &s;even a Clock the Wind turned Ea&s;terly, and we held on our cour&s;e North-north-we&s;t, leaving <HI>Monte Chri&s;to</HI> a-&s;tern of us. About nine a Clock, the head-mo&s;t of the two Cor&s;airs, &s;ailed by a pretty way to the Windward of us, and continued his Cour&s;e. I believe they were afraid of us; however we were all night upon our Guard. We were then becalmed till next day, <HI>Sunday</HI> the &s;ixth of <HI>April,</HI> when about five a Clock in the morning, an ea&s;ie Gale be|gan to blow from Ea&s;t, which by little and little fre&s;hened, and we &s;tood away North-north-ea&s;t. About &s;ix a Clock in the morning, we made a Sail coming upon us afore the Wind, and we kept on our Cour&s;e to meet him; when he was come within a League, or thereabouts of us, he put out White Colours, and we look'd upon that to be but a Trick of a Spani&s;h Cor&s;air: In &s;hort, we &s;hew'd the Engli&s;h Colours, and he continued following us, till eight a Clock in the morning, when he Tackt about, and &s;tood away the way that we came. Perhaps he was afraid, when he &s;aw our Guns out, and that we did not run for it. Some thought that it was one of the two Cor&s;airs, whom we had &s;een the day before: Others, that it was a Spaniard: And others again, that it was a French-man. In the mean time we made way &s;till, and within a little pa&s;&s;ed the I&s;le of <HI>Elba,</HI> of which the Spaniards have one half.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Elba.</NOTE> It hath two good Ports, the one is called <HI>Porto Ferraro,</HI> and belongs to the great Duke; and the other <HI>Porto Longone,</HI> and belongs to the Spaniards. The French took it in the Year One thou&s;and &s;ix hundred and forty &s;ix, but lo&s;t it again One thou&s;and &s;ix hundred and fifty. About ten a Clock we were becalmed, about two in the Afternoon, we had an ea&s;ie Gale from North-north-we&s;t, and &s;teer|ed our cour&s;e We&s;t-north-we&s;t. An hour after, we made a Ship and a Bark a-&s;tern and another Ship on head of us. About four a Clock, we &s;aw the Ship a &s;tern give cha&s;e to the Bark, and afterwards take her. About &s;ix a Clock, we pa&s;&s;ed the I&s;le <HI>Caprara,</HI> leaving it to the Starboard,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Caprara.</NOTE> becau&s;e of the contrary Wind. When we were come near to it, they made a Smoak upon the Tower, to give warning to the Coa&s;t; and there we put out our Colours. From that place we made a Ship at the point of the I&s;land, and on the other hand a Fi|&s;her-Boat. This I&s;le belongs to the <HI>Genoe&s;e;</HI> it is &s;mall, not being above ten Miles in Circuit, but fruitful in good Wine. On the South-&s;ide of it there is a little Tower, and a Ca&s;tle on the North-&s;ide, which has fifty Soldiers in Gari&s;on, and about an hundred Inhabitants, who are &s;o much given to Shoot|ing (there being great &s;tore of Game upon the I&s;land); that for five or &s;ix pound of Powder, they'll give you a Barrel of Wine, and thanks to boot.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Ancho|vy Fi&s;hing.</NOTE> There, and before the I&s;le <HI>Gorgona,</HI> they fi&s;h for <HI>Anchoves,</HI> and in Fi&s;hing-&s;ea|&s;on, &s;o many Boats come there upon that account, that about the Month of <HI>May,</HI> there are above five hundred Souls lodged in the Ca&s;tle.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. LXXXXV.</HI> The Relation of an Engagement we had with three Spani&s;h Cor&s;airs.</HEAD>
<P><HI>S&V;nday</HI> night, and <HI>Monday</HI> morning, the &s;eventh of <HI>April,</HI> the Wind was fickle, &s;ometimes We&s;terly, &s;ometimes Ea&s;terly, but blew always fre&s;h, and we &s;till kept on our Cour&s;e; but <HI>Monday</HI> the &s;eventh of <HI>April,</HI> (which was <HI>Monday</HI> in the Holy Week) about four a Clock in the morning, we made two Ships and a Bark, or Sloop, that bore up towards us, there being &s;o little Wind, that it was almo&s;t a Calm. About eight a Clock, having perceived the Spani&s;h Colours abroad upon the Ships and Bark, we put out the Engli&s;h Colours, and furled all our Sails but the Maintop-&s;ail. This put them to a &s;tand, when they &s;aw with what Re&s;olution we waited for them. So that be|ing within Cannon &s;hot of us, they all three came to Coun&s;el together, and we prepared to make a vigorous Defence, for it was too late for us now to flatter our &s;elves with the hopes that they might be Friends; the &s;torm had hovered &s;o long, that it mu&s;t needs break at la&s;t. I could not then but reflect upon my Luck, that I &s;hould be Shipwrack'd in the Harbour; for having been now almo&s;t &s;even Years ab&s;ent out of <HI>France</HI> my Native Country, when I thought my &s;elf (as it were) &s;ound and &s;afe at Home again, I &s;aw my &s;elf upon the point of lo&s;ing at lea&s;t my Liberty. I made no doubt but that we &s;hould be wor&s;ted in the Engagement, where the Match was &s;o unequal. How|ever, we were all in good heart, and I look'd upon the I&s;les of <HI>Caprara</HI> and <HI>Gorgona,</HI> as two Theatres, wherein the Inhabitants were to behold (at ea&s;e, and out of all danger) the engagement we were about to enter in, like Gla|diators de&s;tined for their Diver&s;ion; for we were at an equal di&s;tance from both the&s;e I&s;les. In the mean time we made all things ready, that were nece&s;|&s;ary for our Defence, all the Che&s;ts, Hamocks, and other Goods and Clothes that were in the Cabins, and upon the Gun-Deck, were carried aloft upon the Poop, that they might be no hindrance to the Traver&s;ing of our Guns, and that produced a good effect. For the Enemies being bu&s;ied in plundering them, were in the mean time killed, and be&s;ides, it hindered them from breaking in with their Hatchets to the Cabin where we were; which they mu&s;t have done to ma&s;ter us. A hole was made in the Floor of the Ma&s;ters Cabin to go down to the Gun-Room, and &s;o all through the Ship, where there was occa|&s;ion; and in ca&s;e the Enemies &s;hould have rendered them&s;elves Ma&s;ters of the great Cabin, we would quickly have got down into the Gun-Room, and ha|ving made fa&s;t the Pa&s;&s;age, blown up the Poop, and all that were upon it. The Main-yard was Chained to the Ma&s;t with a great iron-Chain, which no Hatchet could ea&s;ily cut; for if the Enemies could have brought the Main-yard upon the Deck, they would have made a great clutter in the Ship, and we &s;hould have been half overcome. All the Guns were Loaded, and the &s;ix <HI>Scopa Coperta</HI> Pieces were charged with bunches of Grapes, (the &s;mall &s;hot, I mentioned before). Water was put in all places of the Ship, to put out Fire, if it &s;hould happen any where. All things being thus prepared, our Captain gave the nece&s;&s;ary Orders, then made a &s;hort Speech to his Men, and gave them all a drachm of the Bottle, and then all cried, God &s;ave the Captain. So bidding one another farewel, every one went to his &s;everal Po&s;t; &s;ome to the great Cabin, others to the Gun-Room, &s;ome to the Gun-Deck, and others to the Fore-Ca&s;tle, there being a Man to command in every Po&s;t: For my part, I &s;tayed with the Captain in the great Cabin.<NOTE PLACE="marg">An Engage|ment with three Cor|&s;airs.</NOTE> The Chirurgion went down into the Hold, where he prepared his Medicines, and &s;tayed to take care of the Wounded Men that &s;hould be brought down to him. After the&s;e Gentlemen had been in Coun&s;el almo&s;t two hours, their Boats carrying Men often from one to another, they came up with us. The Engli&s;h Mate who &s;poke French,
<PB N="283" REF="161">
told me, that we &s;hould have the Honour to fire the fir&s;t and la&s;t Gun; and immediately we let flie three or four great &s;hot at them, the fir&s;t of which would certainly have &s;unk the bigge&s;t Ship, if the Bullet had been but half a foot higher, but it fell in the Water clo&s;e by the Ships &s;ide; which &s;eemed to put Courage into them, for they thereupon made loud &s;houts. And the bigge&s;t Ship making a great Noi&s;e and Bravado, with a Trumpet he had, having fired &s;ome great &s;hot among our Rigging, which only grazed upon our Ma&s;ts, about ten a Clock laid us on board, and grappled with us on the Starboard &s;ide, ly|ing along our Quarter, from the Stern to the middle of our Wa&s;te. Immedi|ately we &s;hut our &s;elves into the great Cabin, and then the Guns went off Pell Mell on all hands; the <HI>Patache</HI> and Bark came up and fired their Broad-&s;ides, endeavouring chiefly to &s;hoot our Ma&s;ts by the board, which would have been a great advantage to them. They fired al&s;o &s;everal <HI>Petreras,</HI> charged with Mu&s;quet &s;hot, which would have done great Execution, if we had been Aloft; but our Walls were Mu&s;quet-prooff, and we could hear &s;howers of Bullets bat|ter again&s;t the Ships &s;ides. Pre&s;ently &s;everal of their men came on board of us, who ran up the Shrouds to endeavour to let fall the Yards; and we brought them down with &s;mall &s;hot, which we fired through holes purpo&s;ely made. When they found them&s;elves &s;o well plied with Mu&s;quet &s;hot, and that all who were above Decks (both in their own Ship, and on board of us) were fallen, for we fired out of the Port-holes and Skuttles, upon all that appeared on board of them, and cleared the Deck fore and aft, of all that came on board of us; many of them got up to the top of our Ma&s;ts, thinking that the &s;ecure&s;t place they could find, and no man was more to be &s;een upon the Deck, or any other part of the Ship, they who were aloft hiding them&s;elves the be&s;t way they could. The Bell rung twice or thrice from the Fore-Ca&s;tle, and pre&s;ently we fell upon our Bellies, but they who were upon the Poop hearing the Bell, got immediately upon the Shrouds, &s;o that there was no hitting of them; but &s;ome being perceived one time upon the Poop, (without ringing the Bell) they fired a <HI>Scopa Coperta</HI> from the Fore-Ca&s;tle, which killed three or four of them. In the mean time, we kept firing with great and &s;mall &s;hot, and if any of the Enemy attempted to get upon our Poop over the Skuttles of the Cabins, we ea&s;ily prickt them, or run them through with our Swords. At length, about three a Clock in the Afternoon, finding that the Enemies fired no more, we came out with our Swords and Pi&s;tols, and &s;aw the <HI>Patache</HI> and Bark, towing off with their Boats, and the great Ship grappled with ours, but no body ap|pearing upon the Deck. We &s;ent &s;ome great &s;hot after tho&s;e that fled, and had we fired but as many more, perhaps they would have &s;truck Sail and yield|ed them&s;elves. So we had the Honour to fire the fir&s;t and la&s;t Gun. Then we offered Quarter to tho&s;e who were aloft upon our Ma&s;ts; and as fa&s;t as they came down, we di&s;armed them, and clapt them down into the Hold. The Captain was for &s;ending Men on board their Ship, but it &s;eeming to me &s;trange that they &s;hould &s;o lo&s;e their bigge&s;t Ship, I told the Captain, That perhaps they only pretended to flie, to tempt our Men on board of that Ship, where lying in Ambu&s;h, they might Blow them all up, that &s;o coming back again, they might have le&s;s trouble to take us. He had &s;ome regard to my advice, and &s;ent no body. For my part, I would not &s;uffer my Man to go, though he had a great mind to it; not only becau&s;e I was afraid he might come to &s;ome harm, but al&s;o that it might not be &s;aid the French had Plundered any thing. At length, perceiving that the Enemies Boat carried &s;everal out of that Ship on board the Ve&s;&s;els that fled, and was coming back for more, And being told by a Man who had leapt into the Sea, to &s;ave him&s;elf by Swimming, (but was taken up) that there was no danger; though we a&s;&s;ured him that he &s;hould die for it if he told a Lye: Our Men boarded the Enemies Ship, and pre&s;ently took down the Spani&s;h Colours. They ea&s;ily afterwards made them&s;elves Ma&s;ters of the Men that remained, whom they brought on board of us; mo&s;t part all Bloody, and more than half dead for fear, for they expected no Quarter. Among the re&s;t the Captain was taken, who was a young Dutch-man in the Spaniards Service; he had two Mu&s;quet &s;hots in his right Side, and right Arm His Ship was called the <HI>Great Alexander,</HI> and was the very &s;ame which <HI>Papachin.</HI> had taken by Surpri&s;e and Treachery, from the <HI>Chevalier de Bious,</HI> and this
<PB N="284" REF="162">
Fleman had bought her from <HI>Papachin.</HI> She carried eight and twenty Guns, and &s;ixteen <HI>Petreras,</HI> and the Captain told us, that the <HI>Patache</HI> which was gone with the Bark, carried &s;ixteen Guns, and &s;ix and twenty <HI>Petreras,</HI> and the Bark four Guns, and twenty four <HI>Petreras;</HI> and that among them, they had in all betwixt three and four hundred Men.</P>
<P>He then gave us an account, how the day before, they put to Sea out of <HI>Porto Ferraro,</HI> that having made us, they had born up towards us, and that next morning (which was the &s;ame day of this Engagement) being come up with us, they had held Coun&s;el, and re&s;olved that the <HI>Great Alexander</HI> &s;hould lay us aboard, and the <HI>Patache</HI> and Bark &s;hear along our &s;ide, and fire their Broad-&s;ides into us; that afterward the Bark &s;hould fall a Stern and rake us from Stern to Stem, to beat our Men from the Guns, whil&s;t the <HI>Patache</HI> lay by our &s;ide, and kept continually firing, and therefore they had put Two hun|dred and twenty men on board the <HI>Great Alexander,</HI> an Hundred and fifty into the <HI>Patache,</HI> leaving thirty remaining in the Sloop or Bark. Their re&s;olution was in part executed, for the great Ship laid us aboard and grappled with us, but when the others as they &s;heared by us, &s;aw no Man above Deck, but only &s;ix Guns to &s;cower the Deck, and many of their men fell, they fired their Broad-&s;ides according to their promi&s;e, and then made the be&s;t of their way, leaving the great Ship engaged, who finding them&s;elves wor&s;ted by us, would have been gone al&s;o, and therefore &s;ent &s;everal Men to ca&s;t loo&s;e the Grap|plings; but their de&s;ign being unknown to us, we knocked them down as fa&s;t as they &s;hewed them&s;elves, &s;o that no more of them dur&s;t appear. He al&s;o told us, That about the end of the Engagement, his Boat went three times to the <HI>Patache,</HI> or &s;maller Ship, and carried away from him every time, as many Men as &s;he could hold, it being out of his power to hinder them; and that &s;everal attempting to &s;ave them&s;elves by Swimming, were Drowned. He &s;eemed to be enraged again&s;t the Captain of the <HI>Patache,</HI> who had &s;o abandon|ed him, and &s;aid, That he would willingly give Three thou&s;and pieces of Eight, that he might kill him. We killed on board the <HI>Great Alexander,</HI> three|&s;core and five Men, and wounded above fifty.</P>
<P>We were &s;ince informed at <HI>Legorn,</HI> that (by their own confe&s;&s;ion) they lo&s;t and had di&s;abled in the Engagement, an Hundred and four&s;core Men, partly killed on board their Ships, partly dead of their Wounds a&s;hoar; among whom was the Lieutenant of the <HI>Great Alexander,</HI> and partly Maimed. The <HI>Great Alexander</HI> had four or five &s;hot betwixt Wind and Water, which would have &s;unk her to the bottom, if our Men had not &s;peedily &s;topt the Leaks; and the <HI>Patache</HI> that ran for it, had al&s;o three or four &s;hot betwixt Wind and Water, which would likewi&s;e have &s;unk her to our view, if there had been any rough Sea. We took Ninety three Pri&s;oners, among whom were &s;ome French, who having taken on, &s;ome with Captain <HI>Lantier,</HI> a Fortnight; and &s;ome with Captain <HI>Fugane,</HI> eight days before this Engagement, had left the Ships of the&s;e two Captains at <HI>Porto Ferraro.</HI></P>
<P>We lo&s;t but two Men, both killed by one Cannon Bullet, that going through and through the Gun-Room where they were, carried off one half of their Head, and da&s;hed their Blood and Brains again&s;t the Tillar. We had al&s;o two Men wounded in the Leg with &s;mall &s;hot. The Pri&s;oners being &s;earched and riffled, they untied their Hands, and clapt them down into the Hold, where they had Victuals and Drink given them, and the Wounded were carefully dre&s;t; &s;o that our Chirurgeon had none but Enemies to dre&s;s. And the Chi|rurgeon of the <HI>Great Alexander</HI> told us, That he had never had &s;o much Pra|ctice as that day, for they brought him down Wounded Men, fa&s;ter than he could well turn to. In &s;hort, all the Pri&s;oners were &s;o civilly u&s;ed, that they wondered at it, and &s;aid, that they lived not &s;o well on board their own Ship: But there was a good Guard placed at the Hatches, both to hinder them from attempting any thing, and to hand down what they wanted; as for the Captain he was lodged in the great Cabin with our Captain, where he was well look'd after, and wanted for nothing. I prayed our Captain to give the French their Liberty, which he pre&s;ently did very generou&s;ly, &s;aying, That the French might command any thing on board of his Ship. The chief Mate and &s;ome Sea-men, were &s;ent to &s;ail the Prize. The two other &s;ail with
<PB N="285" REF="162">
much ado rowed off to the I&s;le of <HI>Elba,</HI> and went back to <HI>Porto Ferraro.</HI> When all things were put in order in our Ship, I went along with the Captain to &s;ee the Prize; we found that poor Ship &s;adly &s;hattered, our Cro&s;s-bar-&s;hot had made great Havock in her, one of them had &s;plit a <HI>Petrera</HI> in two, and another &s;o mangled a Gunner, that we found an Arm, a Belly, and two Legs, and no body could tell what was become of the re&s;t of him. The&s;e Cro&s;s-bar-&s;hot are round Bars of Iron, three Fingers thick, and a Foot long; ha|ving at each end a round knob of Iron, all of one piece, they are put long-ways into the Gun, but when they come out, they flie cro&s;s-ways, every way doing terrible Execution. There were dying Men &s;till on board that Ship, who could not be removed, becau&s;e of their Mortal Wounds; and the Dead were thrown over-board, &s;o &s;oon as we were Ma&s;ters of the Ship. We found on board a great many Bales of Stuff, fine Cloth, and other things, which they had taken &s;ome days before in the two French Ships, I formerly menti|oned, and four thou&s;and pieces of Eight in ready Money.</P>
<P>We ob&s;erved that that day was St. <HI>Alexander</HI>'s Day, and the Ship which we took, was called the <HI>Great Alexander.</HI> After we had rejoyced a little, and heartily prai&s;ed God for our Adventure, we made the be&s;t of our Way; about &s;even a Clock at night, we had the Wind at South-we&s;t, and &s;tood away North. <HI>Tue&s;day</HI> the eighth of <HI>April,</HI> about two a Clock in the Morning, we &s;ailed by <HI>Gorgona,</HI> a little I&s;land belonging to the Great Duke;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gorgona.</NOTE> leaving it to the Larboard, and &s;teered on our Cour&s;e, with the Prize a-&s;tern of us. About five a Clock in the morning, from the Main-top we di&s;covered the Light of <HI>Legorn.</HI> About &s;even in the morning, we &s;pied a Sail to the Starboard, bear|ing towards us, but &s;hortly after it &s;teered away its fir&s;t Cour&s;e. About two a Clock in the Afternoon, we came into the Road of <HI>Legorn,</HI> and entered in Triumph, having on the Poop, and Maintop-ma&s;t head, the Spani&s;h Colours under the Engli&s;h, and the Trumpet of the Prize &s;ounded, whil&s;t the Prize came after us without any En&s;ign abroad. So &s;oon as we came into the Road, the Prize fired all the Guns and <HI>Petreras</HI> with &s;hot, and then our Ship fired &s;even Guns, and came to an Anchor. All the People were come to the Harbour to know what the matter was, for they had heard the Guns when we were Engaged; and be&s;ides a Bark having &s;et out from <HI>Legorn,</HI> and &s;een our En|gagement at a di&s;tance, came back again, alledging that they were obliged to do &s;o, becau&s;e they had &s;een four Ships engaged, two again&s;t two. When we were come in, and that from &s;hoar they &s;aw a Ship without Colours, they &s;oon concluded it was a Prize, but when they &s;aw the Spani&s;h Colours under the Engli&s;h, their Affections were much divided. So &s;oon as we were quiet at Anchor, all the Engli&s;h Ships &s;aluted us; then the Health-boat came, and put Waiters on board of us, to keep the People of the Town from mingling with us. To the&s;e we gave a full account of our Engagement, which they punctu|ally wrote down, how many Pri&s;oners we had taken, and how many were Killed and Wounded, that they might &s;end the news of it to the Great Duke. After that, all the Engli&s;h in <HI>Legorn,</HI> and &s;everal French, came in Boats on board to vi&s;it us, and congratulate our Victory, we &s;aluted them all with three Guns a piece; &s;o that our Ship fired above two hundred Guns that day. Then they went to &s;ee the Prize, which the Captain called his Child. Every Body was a&s;toni&s;hed at this Victory, for it had never been known before, that a Merchant-man took a Man of War, which had two others to a&s;&s;i&s;t her. Our Captain was &s;o Ju&s;t to us, as to tell all that came on board of him, that the French had had a great hand in &s;aving his Ship, which the &s;ame day went over all <HI>Legorn,</HI> and afterwards all over <HI>Italy.</HI></P>
<P>It is certain enough we had our &s;hare in that Victory, though we were but five French-men in all, to wit, three Merchants of <HI>Mar&s;eilles,</HI> my &s;elf, and my man. For the Engli&s;h are very nimble in Charging and Di&s;charging their Guns, and will Fire three &s;hot, before others can do two, and all the Officers of the Ship fought very well; but the Common Sea-men were in &s;uch a Maze, that they knew not what they did, and were put in heart much by the French, who fired without intermi&s;&s;ion: So that my Man, called <HI>John Guillerval,</HI> with thirteen &s;hot, killed &s;o many Men, (as all that were on the &s;ame Quarter affirmed who ea&s;ily &s;aw what Execution every &s;hot did.) Hardly any Guns
<PB N="286" REF="163">
but tho&s;e in the Poop were u&s;ed, and every time they were to be Traver&s;ed, the French mu&s;t lend a hand to it; for the Engli&s;h Sea-men &s;eemed to be a &s;leep, and laughed to &s;ee the French tug at it. My man al&s;o &s;erved there &s;o eagerly, that he cru&s;hed one of his Fingers betwixt a Rope and a Pully of a Gun which he was bringing to, and I was afraid he &s;hould have been maimed by it. I thought my &s;elf obliged to &s;ay of him in this place, what all the men of the Ship have every where publi&s;hed, &s;eeing it is all the Reward he had, for though the Captain promi&s;ed him his &s;hare in the Booty, (as in right it did belong to him as well as to all who fought); neverthele&s;s he gave him nothing, nor to any other of the French, nor indeed, did we ask any thing. In the mean time, (though we were in the Port) yet we kept good Guard aboard in the Night-time, having all our Guns loaded with &s;hot, becau&s;e we had a &s;u&s;picion that &s;ome Dutch Ships, that were al&s;o in the Port, had a mind to take our Prize from us, and the Great Duke &s;eemed unwilling to allow us his Protection. Our Captain told me, That if the Great Duke would not re|ceive him into Protection, he was re&s;olved to kill and throw over-board all the Pri&s;oners, and then &s;et &s;ail for <HI>England</HI> with his Prize. This de&s;ign wrought horrour in me, and I was much in fear they might put it in Execution; for I perceived they were inclinable enough to do &s;o: But at length, on <HI>Good-Friday,</HI> about four a Clock in the Afternoon, the Health-boat came aboard of us, and gave us <HI>Prattick,</HI> entring the Ship and mingling with us, which was a &s;ingular favour; for we expected at lea&s;t to have made a Week or a Fortnight of <HI>Quarantine.</HI> All the Pri&s;oners were &s;et at Liberty, and put a-&s;hoar, and next day, <HI>Saturday</HI> the twelfth of <HI>April,</HI> we al&s;o went a-&s;hoar.</P>

<HEAD>A RELATION Of what pa&s;t at the Taking of BABYLON, OTHERWISE CALLED BAGDAT, BY SULTAN AMURATH Emperour of the TURKS; Tran&s;lated from a Letter written from the &s;aid City by the <HI>Grand Signior</HI>'s chief Faulconer to <HI>Mu&s;tapha Bey,</HI> one of the <HI>Sangiacks</HI> of <HI>Egypt,</HI> at <HI>Caire.</HI> After the giving of God thanks, and other Cere|monies u&s;ed by the <HI>Turks</HI> in their Letters.</HEAD>
<P>THE eighth of the Moon of <HI>Regeb,</HI> which was the eleventh of <HI>November,</HI> 1638. the <HI>Grand Signior</HI> pitched his Camp before <HI>Bagdat,</HI> in the &s;ame place where (above an hundred years before) <HI>Sultan Solyman</HI> had pitched his: And the &s;ame day he went to the Sepulchre of the ble&s;&s;ed <HI>Iman Azam,</HI> and cal|led together all the <HI>Viziers, Ba&s;has,</HI> and other chief Officers of his Army, com|manding them to Draw up their &s;everal men in Battel-array, and after that, allotted the Po&s;ts to all the Principal Commanders, encompa&s;&s;ing his Camp with Hor&s;e, and placing all his Foot round him&s;elf. Then he rode on Hor&s;e|back round about the whole Camp, and came into the middle, which was &s;o well &s;hut in, that no body could go out or in, without giving an account to Generals that were po&s;ted on the Flanks. The &s;ame day he cau&s;ed great heaps of Earth to be ca&s;t up in all places, where the Cannon of the Town could an|noy us, and ordered great quantities of Wood and Faggots to be brought, which being mingled with he Earth, made three Hills in as many places, higher
<PB N="288" REF="164">
than the Walls of <HI>Bagdat,</HI> and upon each of them he cau&s;ed twenty pieces of Cannon to be mounted, which began to play next day by break of day. And at the &s;ame time, he cau&s;ed a high Tower to be rai&s;ed before his Pavillion, on the top whereof his Maje&s;ty mounted, and &s;aw (as out of a Gallery) what was done in his Army, and within <HI>Bagdat,</HI> out of danger of the Enemies Guns, and there he &s;ent for all the great Men of the Law, Ju&s;tices, and Militia, to whom he &s;aid: You <HI>Mufti, Viziers, Beillierbeis, Ba&s;has, Sangiacks,</HI> and all the re&s;t of you, whom God hath put under my Obedience, think not that I am come hither to return back again without taking this place: No, I am come with this great number of Soldiers faithful to the Law, to Conquer or die here, and therefore all and every one of you, ought to make the &s;ame re&s;olu|tion. For I am re&s;olved with my own hand to kill the great men that &s;hall not do their Duty, and cau&s;e the Inferiour to be put to death one by another, or by the hands of the Enemy, and then will die my &s;elf; that it may in Hi&s;tory be tran&s;mitted to Po&s;terity, that a Succe&s;&s;our of the <HI>Great Othoman</HI> died here with a Million of men in defence of the Faith.</P>
<P>After that, &s;oftening his Voice a little, and treating them with le&s;s &s;harp|ne&s;s. Look you, (&s;aid he to them) the World is but a &s;mall matter, or nothing at all; he that dies in well doing, is well after Death, but he who dies killing an enemy of the Faith, is more happy in Paradi&s;e. Look you, Fathers, (for &s;o I call the Old) and you Brethren who are of the &s;ame Age with me, for we are made of the &s;ame Matter, let us do &s;omewhat that may oblige our great Prophet <HI>Mahomet</HI> to be our Advocate, and that at the day of Judgment he may pre&s;ent us all before the Tribunal of God, &s;aying to Him, Here are the Faithful who have fought valiantly for the greate&s;t Glory of your holy Maje&s;ty, and of all your Saints; and in the mean time, that it may be &s;aid in time to come, that we have had re&s;t in this World, and glory in the next. To attain to which, it is expedient to labour, and not to fear dan|gers. But why &s;hould you fear them, being called to this Engagement for the &s;ake of our great Prophet, who promi&s;es us &s;o much favour before the Maje&s;ty of the Great God? No, I do not think you do, and if I find that any of you go not willingly to fight, I'll kill him with my own Sword.</P>
<P>This being heard by all that were pre&s;ent, they put their hand upon their Head, and an&s;wered all unanimou&s;ly, That they were ready to obey his Im|perial Commands: And even from thence they began to fight without lo&s;ing of time, and the <HI>Grand Signior</HI> cau&s;ed the Pavillions of all the Chirurgeons of the Army to be pitched near to his own, ordering all the Wounded men to be brought thither to be Dre&s;t, which was done, and he him&s;elf comforted them with very good Words, and good Deeds; giving to every one forty or fifty <HI>Chequins.</HI> And it was found that in one day, he gave to &s;even hundred Wound|ed men, from whence you may judge, whether or not the fight was furious; and cau&s;ed the pay of tho&s;e that died, to be given to their Children, or their neare&s;t Relations. And during the thirty nine days that the Siege la&s;ted, the Town being taken on the fortieth, his Maje&s;ty made his Prayers every day, and every night upon his Knees, pro&s;trating him&s;elf upon the Ground, with Tears in his Eyes. And &s;eeing every evening, we Carted away a little of the &s;ame earth, whereof Ramparts had been made to &s;ecure us from the Enemies Guns, in making our approaches to the Town: We were got on the tenth of the Moon of <HI>Chaban,</HI> clo&s;e by the fir&s;t Ditches, and the <HI>Sultan</HI> commanded a great many &s;acks of Earth to be thrown into them; which was done with &s;o much diligence, and in &s;o great quantities, that in four days time they were filled up, and three other Mounts were made, to the top whereof the Cannon which were mounted on the former were brought, from whence we battered down one half of the Walls of <HI>Bagdat,</HI> the other half being buried under heaps of Earth all round, where the Cannon could not make a breach. A thou&s;and &s;hot were fired into the Town, which hit again&s;t certain Towers or Steeples that re&s;i&s;ted the Bullets, and made them rebound without any dam|mage from them. At the Po&s;t of the <HI>Salictar Ba&s;ha,</HI> which was by one of the Mounts, there were twelve Guns, and three great Cannons Royal, which continu|ally played into the Town, and battered down a great number of Hou&s;es. The Grand Vizier had his Po&s;t at another Mount with the <HI>Romali's,</HI> from
<PB N="289" REF="164">
whence they made an a&s;&s;ault into the Town, and took three Ba&s;tions; but there he was killed by a Mu&s;quet-&s;hot in the Head, and three <HI>Beillierbeis</HI> were Wounded, to wit, <HI>Chus Ca&s;inader, Hibraim Ba&s;&s;a, Beillierbey</HI> of <HI>Siras, Var Varally Ba&s;&s;a,</HI> who was <HI>Beillierbey</HI> of <HI>Natolia,</HI> and <HI>Queu&s;&s;e Chaban Ba&s;&s;a,</HI> and &s;even <HI>Alaibeys,</HI> that is to &s;ay, Camp-Ma&s;ters, and a great many others kil|led.</P>
<P>The &s;ixteenth of the Moon of <HI>Chaban,</HI> the <HI>Grand Vizier</HI> died, the &s;even-teenth <HI>Mu&s;tapha, Ba&s;ha,</HI> who was Ba&s;ha of the Sea, and <HI>Caymacan</HI> was put in his place, and the <HI>Grand Signior</HI> gave him the Seals. The eighteenth there fell &s;o much Rain, that we could not keep our Matches lighted, and we entred the Town with &s;o great Fury and Impetuo&s;ity, that the be&s;ieged begged Quarter, veiled their Standards and Colours, as a &s;ign that they &s;ubmitted to the Di&s;|cretion of the <HI>Sultan.</HI> At the &s;ame time the <HI>Kiaya,</HI> (as if one &s;hould &s;ay) the Captain of the Arms, or Lieutenant and principal Officer of the Governour of <HI>Bagdat,</HI> went to the <HI>Grand Vizier</HI> with a Scarfe about his Neck, and his Sword wreathed in it, which is an Ignominious mark of Submi&s;&s;ion, and begged both in his own and Ma&s;ter's name, <HI>Aman,</HI> that is to &s;ay, Pardon or Mercy; and having obtained it, the Governour, named <HI>Bektachkhan,</HI> came al&s;o, and the <HI>Grand Vizier</HI> leaving them both there, went to wait on the <HI>Grand Signior,</HI> to whom he related what had happened, be&s;eeching him to &s;ave the Lives of tho&s;e two poor Penitents, which he obtained. And forthwith, the Emperour commanded all to draw up in the be&s;t Equipage they could, to make a fair &s;hew, and with great Pomp and Magnificence, cau&s;ed <HI>Bektachkhan</HI> to be brought into his Pavillion: Where being come, he was &s;o confounded at the Lu&s;tre of &s;o great Maje&s;ty, as appeared in all the Court of the <HI>Grand Signior,</HI> that his Blood was chilled, being able to &s;ay nothing, but <HI>God be prai&s;ed, God be prai&s;ed.</HI> The <HI>Sultan</HI> &s;at on his Throne, and <HI>Bektachkhan</HI> fell upon the ground demanding Pardon, and imploring his Mercy, which he obtained. The <HI>Grand Signior</HI> commanding him to ri&s;e up, and draw near his Per&s;on, asked him many Que&s;tions, which he having an&s;wered to his &s;atisfaction, he gave him a Ve&s;t lined with Sables, with a Dagger and Girdle &s;et with precious Stones, and a Plume of Herons-top upon an En&s;ign, of great value; &s;ending him back into the Town, with orders to &s;end out to him all the chief Com|manders and Officers: And to tell the People, That they who would continue in his Service, &s;hould be welcome, and the re&s;t di&s;mi&s;&s;ed without Arms; or if they would ob&s;tinately &s;tand it out, they &s;hould all be put to the Sword. Then <HI>Bektachkhan</HI> pro&s;trating him&s;elf again upon the Ground, mo&s;t humbly thanked his Maje&s;ty, promi&s;ing to be his Slave, not with one, but with a thou&s;and Souls. Which is a way of &s;peaking, that takes very well in Tur|ki&s;h, and returned to the Pavillion of the <HI>Grand Vizier,</HI> from whence he &s;ent his <HI>Kiaya</HI> into the Town, to make known the <HI>Grand Signior</HI>'s plea|&s;ure.</P>
<P>But before he was got there, the Soldiers in the <HI>Grand Vizier</HI>'s Po&s;t, entered at the &s;ame in&s;tant by the Gate, called <HI>Himan Azana,</HI> and began to plunder the Hou&s;es. Six <HI>Chams</HI> that were in the Town, (who are in <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> what the Ba&s;has are in <HI>Turkie</HI>) &s;eeing this, could not endure it with patience, but cried out, that they had &s;atisfied their word to them, &s;aying, That af|ter they were received to Mercy, they were u&s;ed with Rigour, and got to|gether as many Soldiers as they could, at the Gate called <HI>Cara Cape,</HI> and they who would not follow them, asked Quarter. But our men were &s;o hot upon Slaying and Plundering, that they would not hearken to them, and killed all they met, during the whole night that this Sacking la&s;ted; and God knows what a va&s;t number of Per&s;ians died in this Action. Morning being come, the &s;aid <HI>Chams</HI> with fifteen thou&s;and men they got together, &s;et their Soldiers to the Wall, and with their Swords couragiou&s;ly defended them|&s;elves: Which being told the <HI>Sultan,</HI> he commanded all the Soldiers of the other Po&s;ts to enter the Town, and put all to the Sword; but being entered, &s;ome &s;ubmitted them&s;elves to the will of the <HI>Grand Signior,</HI> and the re&s;t &s;tood it out till they were killed. Of the la&s;t there were Ten thou&s;and who were killed, and Five thou&s;and of the others, and the &s;ix <HI>Chams</HI> were made Pri|&s;oners; who&s;e names are <HI>Napte Cham,</HI> the <HI>Grand Viziers</HI> Pri&s;oner, with the
<PB N="290" REF="165">
Governour <HI>Baktachkhan, Mirfalta Allibeikhan,</HI> and <HI>La Ella Mahemet, O&s;&s;ein Cham,</HI> of the <HI>Saliktar Ba&s;&s;a,</HI> and <HI>Aleph Cham,</HI> with twelve other great Men, one with <HI>O&s;&s;ein Ba&s;&s;a,</HI> heretofore Ba&s;&s;a of <HI>Caire.</HI> The Five thou&s;and Per&s;ians who asked Quarter, were guarded by a <HI>Beillierbey,</HI> till they were pa&s;t the Army, to hinder our Soldiers from injuring them. But the <HI>Grand Vizier</HI> &s;ee|ing them pa&s;s by his Pavillion, a&s;&s;embled all the chief Commanders who were near him, and &s;aid to them: Why do we give Quarter to tho&s;e Dogs who have no Faith, and never keep their word? They have not rendered volun|tarily, but we have con&s;trained them to do it by force, God having for that end &s;trengthened the Arms of our valiant Soldiers. Are not they the &s;ame whom we overcame at <HI>Revan,</HI> to whom the <HI>Sultan</HI> &s;hewed &s;o much Goodne&s;s and Cle|mency, who having given them <HI>Quarter,</HI> &s;ent them away with their Arms and Baggage, but they unthankful for that Favour, cut in pieces Ten thou|&s;and of our men, whom they took at a Di&s;advantage? What &s;hall become of the blood of the Faithful whom they have &s;o cruelly Ma&s;&s;acred? Mercy was granted them on condition that they yielded without fighting: But having &s;ince ob&s;ti|nately re&s;i&s;ted, they have rendered them&s;elves unworthy of it, and be it as it will, though the <HI>Grand Signior</HI> hath pardoned them, yet I pardon them not. And all of a &s;udden, he commanded <HI>Nauvy Aully, Adrevis Mahemet Ba&s;&s;a, Varva|rally Ba&s;&s;a, Chus Ca&s;anadar, Hibrahim Ba&s;&s;a,</HI> Ba&s;&s;a of <HI>Sivas,</HI> to fall upon them, and cut them in pieces. Which at fir&s;t they refu&s;ed, alleadging for excu&s;e, that the Emperour had pardoned them. But for their Ju&s;tification, he gave them the Command in writing, taking the blame (if any were) upon him|&s;elf; by vertue whereof, they went and executed his Orders. Which made the <HI>Grand Signior</HI> &s;end for him in great Rage, asking him, Why he had given &s;uch Orders contrary to his Promi&s;e, and violated the Faith he had given? To which the <HI>Grand Vizier</HI> replied Irreverently, That if he had &s;hewed them Mercy, for his part he would not, for the rea&s;ons afore mentioned; which he re|peated to the <HI>Sultan.</HI> Who having con&s;idered, and reflected a little upon what he had heard, pulled off the Ve&s;t he had on, and gave it to the <HI>Grand Vizier,</HI> prai&s;ing him for what he had done.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, There were in <HI>Bagdat,</HI> One and thirty thou&s;and pick'd and choice Soldiers, and Twenty thou&s;and Volunteers, all whom we have put to the Sword, not one having e&s;caped to carry the news to the other Towns of <HI>Per&s;ia.</HI> We have made the &s;upputation by the Mu&s;ter Rolls of the five <HI>Chams</HI> that are Pri&s;oners. And there has been no &s;uch Battel fought again&s;t the <HI>Per|&s;ians,</HI> no not in the time of <HI>Khaldivan,</HI> when the Battel was fought betwixt <HI>Sultan Selim,</HI> the Father of <HI>Sultan Solyman,</HI> and <HI>Cha I&s;hmael,</HI> King of <HI>Per&s;ia;</HI> wherein above an Hundred thou&s;and men were killed on both &s;ides.</P>
<P>The eighteenth of the Moon of <HI>Chaban,</HI> being <HI>Friday,</HI> the City of <HI>Bagdat</HI> was entirely delivered up to the <HI>Grand Signior,</HI> with the Grace of God, and the Benediction of the People, who &s;eem to have got new Life. When the Be&s;ieged &s;aw that they could no longer re&s;i&s;t the Will of God, who vi&s;ibly favoured the Arms of our great Emperour. They killed all their Wives and young Children and Ham-&s;trung four or five thou&s;and Hor&s;es of great value, that they might not be &s;erviceable to us. <HI>Bektachkhan</HI> (to whom the <HI>Sultan</HI> made &s;uch fair Pre&s;ents, as you have &s;een before) having entered the Town, Poy|&s;oned him&s;elf one Night, and was found dead in the Morning, and buried like a Dog. Before the <HI>Grand Signior</HI> &s;et out from <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> there came an Am|ba&s;&s;adour from the King of <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> who was Arre&s;ted by command from the <HI>Sultan,</HI> and he hath been under Guard to this pre&s;ent. The <HI>Grand Signior</HI> cau&s;ed him to be brought before him, and &s;aid to him, Go tell your King, that he &s;end me <HI>Bo&s;tan Ba&s;&s;a, Memy Ba&s;&s;a, Jan Ba&s;&s;a, Gart Ibrahim Ba&s;&s;a, Chopour Biqueri,</HI> whom he keeps Pri&s;oners in <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> with all he took at <HI>Bagdat</HI> and <HI>Revan,</HI> both Money, Arms, and Ammunition; and that he re&s;tore to me <HI>Tauris, Inu&s;chivam, Cheri&s;ul,</HI> and all the other Provinces and Places, that my Great Grand-Father <HI>Solyman</HI> took, and that he give me the Tribute and Pre&s;ents, which he made at that time, and with that we will &s;et our Limits; that if he'll hold to, and ob&s;erve the&s;e Conditions, I will be Content, and we &s;hall end our Controver&s;ies. Otherwi&s;e I declare to him, that though he hide him|&s;elf in the Earth like a Pi&s;mire, or flie in the Air like a Bird, he &s;hall not e&s;cape
<PB N="291" REF="165">
my hands. And I will reduce his whole Country to &s;uch a &s;tate, that there &s;hall not be a Hou&s;e &s;tanding in <HI>I&s;pahan, Gasbin,</HI> and <HI>Erdebil,</HI> nor in any of his Towns, Burroughs, or Villages, that there &s;hall not a pile of Gra&s;s be left within his Kingdom; and that I will afterward Cha&s;e him before me, as a Hunter does his Prey, and let him well con&s;ider, that Repentance will not &s;tand him in &s;tead, after the Fault is committed. That if he will be ob&s;tinate &s;till, let him make ready again&s;t the Spring, when (with the help of God) I &s;hall be in his Country; and then though he &s;hould a thou&s;and times ask my Mercy, there &s;hall be none for him.</P>
<P>And having cau&s;ed a Letter to be written to the &s;ame effect, the <HI>Sultan</HI> gave it to the Amba&s;&s;adour, and di&s;mi&s;&s;ed him. And hath &s;ince cau&s;ed the Sepulchre of <HI>Himan Azam</HI> to be rebuilt, and hath adorned it with &s;everal Golden Lamps &s;et with precious Stones, and covered the Floor with Silk Carpets; having likewi&s;e beautified the Sepulchres of the other Saints. By what can be judged, it is the plea&s;ure of the <HI>Grand Signior</HI> to expect the An&s;wer of the King of <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> and then to return <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> and all his Subjects will be in repo&s;e.

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. I.</HI> The Author's departure not only from <HI>Paris</HI> but <HI>Mar&s;eilles,</HI> and his Voyage to <HI>Alexandria.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THOUGH I had &s;pent &s;even whole years of my younger days in former Travels; neverthele&s;s the &s;ame pa&s;&s;ion which had already carried me &s;o far into the Ea&s;t, &s;till prompted me with a de&s;ire of &s;eeing <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> and the <HI>Indies.</HI> I had not long re&s;ted at home among my Relations and Friends, when that de&s;ire began to exert its power over me, and if it was not &s;trong enough at fir&s;t to force me from tho&s;e who were &s;o dear unto me, at lea&s;t it bu&s;ied me in taking nece&s;&s;ary mea&s;ures for &s;econd Travels, and that with greater profit than I had performed the fir&s;t, if I &s;hould chance to &s;et out upon them. In that thought I employed four years in the &s;tudy of the Sciences, which I judged mo&s;t u&s;efull to a Traveller, who would make advantage of his Travels, and communicate the &s;ame to others. In &s;hort, having (during all that time) wavered, betwixt the de&s;ign of travelling, and that of &s;ettling at <HI>Paris,</HI> when I &s;aw my &s;elf &s;o well prepared for the former; and con&s;idered be&s;ides that to defer the other, would be in &s;ome manner to com|ply with the Times, I ea&s;ily gave way to my fir&s;t inclination: So that having, as &s;ecretly as I could, taken orders for all things I &s;tood in need of, not only for accompli&s;hing my de&s;ign, but al&s;o for avoiding tho&s;e inconveniencies which might have been too difficult for me to &s;upport; I left <HI>Paris</HI> the &s;ixteenth of <HI>October</HI> 1663,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Authours departure.</NOTE> pretending a Journey with a Friend for &s;ome weeks into <HI>Burgun|dy.</HI> The &s;ixth of <HI>November</HI> I came to <HI>Mar&s;eilles,</HI> and on the twelfth about ten of the clock at Night, I embarked there in a Galley of <HI>Legorn,</HI> which had ar|rived at that Port three days before.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>His Embar|king at</HI> Mar|&s;eilles.

an hundred and ten miles from <HI>Mar&s;eilles,</HI> from whence it &s;et out again on <HI>Wedne&s;day</HI> after midnight, and about five of the clock at Night, came to an anchor at St. <HI>Remigio,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">St. <HI>Remigio.</HI></NOTE> &s;eventy five miles from <HI>Rocca Tagliata.</HI> St. <HI>Remi|gio</HI> is a pretty Town belonging to the <HI>Genoe&s;e,</HI> with a little Fort, and conve|nience to make a good Harbour; but that Republick will not &s;uffer it to be done: it is covered by a Mole, and wants only to be dug. The Countrey is all Garden, produces plenty of all things, and e&s;pecially of Wine, Oyl, Ce|dar, Oranges and other Fruits.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Genoa.</NOTE>We parted from thence on <HI>Thur&s;day</HI> the fifteenth of <HI>November</HI> after mid|night, and about &s;ix of the clock at night came to an anchor before <HI>Genoa,</HI> four&s;core and ten miles di&s;tant from St. <HI>Remigio. Friday</HI> about midnight we left that place,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Porto Venere.</NOTE> and came to an anchor again at <HI>Porto Venere,</HI> three&s;core miles from <HI>Genoa. Porto Venere</HI> is a &s;mall Town, but the Hou&s;es fair and well built. It hath a Fort very advantageou&s;ly &s;eated upon a Rock that commands the mouth of the Harbour. This Port, or Gulf rather, is on the one &s;ide covered by the main Land, and on the other, by a fruitfull I&s;land, which lies before it towards <HI>Lerice,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Lerice. Golfe della Spetie.</NOTE> between which and that I&s;land is the gulf <HI>Della Spetie.</HI> This is the la&s;t place of the Territories of the <HI>Genoe&s;e:</HI> we &s;aluted it with four Guns, and were an&s;wered with three. This Countrey is fruitfull in Vines and Olive-trees. From <HI>Mar&s;eilles</HI> to <HI>Porto Venere</HI> we had all the way fair weather.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Legorn.</NOTE> At midnight following we weighed anchor, and with a fair North-Wind about eleven of the clock in the forenoon arrived at <HI>Legorn,</HI> three&s;core miles from <HI>Porto Venere,</HI> and this was on <HI>Saturday</HI> the &s;eventeenth of <HI>November.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Tue&s;day</HI> the four and twentieth of <HI>January</HI> 1663/4 about half an hour pa&s;t eleven in the forenoon, I went on board the Ship of Captain <HI>Richard de la Cicuta,</HI> a man commendable for his piety and civility; that Ship was called, <HI>N. Dame de la Grace,</HI> carrying about two hundred and fifty, or three hundred Tun: &s;he had on board thirty Seamen, four great Guns, and &s;ix Bra&s;s <HI>Petre|ra's.</HI> So &s;oon as we were on board &s;he made &s;ail with a North-Wind, and &s;teered a cour&s;e South-South-We&s;t; about &s;ix a clock at night, the Wind chopped about to North-We&s;t,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Capraia.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Monte Chri|&s;to.

All that day we had <HI>Sardinia</HI> to the Star-board,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sardinia.</NOTE> but at a pretty good di&s;tance: In the beginning of the Night the Wind blew a little fre&s;her, but far le&s;s than the Night before.</P>
<P>Saturday morning the &s;ix and twentieth we had lo&s;t &s;ight of <HI>Sardinia,</HI> and being fair before the Wind, &s;o that no Sails but the Main and Main-Top-Sails could bear, we put out our Stutting Sails. About noon, the Wind &s;hifted about to the North, and two hours after to the North-Ea&s;t: and therefore we took in our Stutting Sails; and kept on our cour&s;e South-South-Ea&s;t: In the eve|ning the Wind abated &s;o, that all night long we were becalmed.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Maretimo.</NOTE>Next day being Sunday, we made the I&s;land of <HI>Maretimo</HI> a-head: and about eleven a clock in the morning, we &s;tood away South-Ea&s;t: about two a clock afternoon, we made a Sail a great way off to the Leeward; all that day we had a Calm till night, when the Wind blew &s;o fre&s;h again, that about midnight we pa&s;t betwixt <HI>Maretimo,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Levanzo.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Sicily. Capo Boco.

<PB N="3" REF="168">
that he had not pa&s;&s;ed through the <HI>Phare of Me&s;&s;ina,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Phare of Me&s;|&s;ina.</NOTE> which would have &s;aved him fifty miles in his cour&s;e; but then he told me that he dur&s;t not venture through &s;o dangerous a pa&s;&s;age in the Winter-time when Storms are &s;o fre|quent, and the rather about New Moon, when commonly the VVinds change. Towards the evening we were becalmed, and had a breeze again in the be|ginning of the night; and in that manner the Wind fell and ro&s;e &s;everal times during the night. That day,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Murenes.</NOTE> we took two <HI>Murenes</HI> or Sea-Eeles which were in the Fi&s;her mens Wells; this Fi&s;h is dainty Food, but the Skin of it is Slimey, and is &s;o full of &s;mall bones, that if one have not a care, he may be choaked by them; it is &s;haped like a common Eele, and dies &s;o &s;oon as it is out of the Water.</P>
<P><HI>Tue&s;day</HI> a very fre&s;h Ea&s;t-North-Ea&s;t Wind ro&s;e with the Sun, and we con|tinued our cour&s;e South-South-Ea&s;t; about ten of the clock in the morning the Wind cea&s;ed and left us in a Calm, over again&s;t <HI>Monte Gibello,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Monte Gibello.</NOTE> which we &s;aw &s;o plainly, that we could ea&s;ily perceive it was covered with Snow. A little after, we made a Ship on head, but becau&s;e it &s;tood in to Shoar we thought they were afraid of us. The Calm la&s;ted till night; during which we had &s;ometimes Breezes of Wind, and &s;ometimes Calms, with which we made a little way.</P>
<P><HI>Wedne&s;day</HI> morning we were got in &s;ight of <HI>Malta,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Malta.</NOTE> &s;even hundred miles from <HI>Legorn,</HI> and about two hundred from <HI>Sicily,</HI> which we had not yet lo&s;t &s;ight of. He that looked out, made a Sail towards <HI>Malta.</HI> At fir&s;t we were in a dead Calm, but a little after we had a very great Sea from the We&s;t, which to&s;&s;ed us &s;ufficiently, though there was not a breath of Wind: we there|fore furled our Sails, and that rowling Sea la&s;ted till one of the clock at noon; when there aro&s;e a gentle North-North-Ea&s;t-Breeze, which made us &s;pread our Sails, and &s;tand away Ea&s;t-South-Ea&s;t, that we might make <HI>Candie,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Candie.</NOTE> &s;even hundred miles from <HI>Malta.</HI> That Wind la&s;ted not above an hour; &s;o that we were becalmed till about eleven a clock at night, when we had a &s;tiff North Gale, with which we &s;till continued our cour&s;e Ea&s;t-South Ea&s;t.</P>
<P>That fre&s;h Gale la&s;ted all <HI>Thur&s;day</HI> till night, and then we had a &s;trong gu&s;t of Wind with &s;ome Rain: when that was over, we had fair weather, the Sea becoming Calm in a moment, though before the Rain it was exceeding rough: but half an hour after the weather and Sea began to grow rougher than before, and then Calmed again, which happened twice that night. Du|ring the&s;e gu&s;ts the Sea was &s;o rough, that it was not po&s;&s;ible to &s;tand upright in any place of the Ship, &s;o &s;trangely was &s;he to&s;&s;ed, becau&s;e of a rowling Sea that came upon us on poop and on both &s;ides; the roughne&s;s of the Sea in poop was occa&s;ioned by the violence of the Wind, and on the Star-board by the currents of the <HI>Gulf of Venice,</HI> off of which we were,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gulf of Ve|nice.</NOTE> and neverthele&s;s we made betwixt eight and ten miles an hour. About midnight it blew fre&s;h from North-We&s;t, with which we bore away Ea&s;t and by South, that we might not &s;tand too far off of the <HI>Gozo of Candie.</HI></P>
<P>That Wind la&s;ted all <HI>Friday</HI> the fir&s;t of <HI>February;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Gozo of Candie.</NOTE> about night we had &s;moo|ther Water, the Sea on poop only remaining, which with the Wind that &s;hifted about to the We&s;t, and blew fre&s;h made us run above twelve miles an hour: but about ten a clock at night we had a &s;welling Sea again which made us rowl all night long.</P>
<P>Next day we were troubled with the &s;ame weather, and &s;trong gu&s;ts of Wind by fits. About night, &s;ince we had not made the Land of <HI>Candie,</HI> as we expected, by rea&s;on of the cloudy dark day, it was con&s;ulted what cour&s;e we &s;hould &s;teer; every one brought forth his ob&s;ervations, and all agreed in general, that our cour&s;e was to the Windward of the <HI>Gozo of Candie;</HI> but be|cau&s;e one among&s;t them, according to his account, &s;et off our cour&s;e betwixt <HI>Candie</HI> and the <HI>Gozo;</HI> though it was known he was in a mi&s;take, &s;eeing accor|ding to his own account, we mu&s;t then have been very near, and almo&s;t up|on the &s;aid <HI>Gozo:</HI> neverthele&s;s for greater &s;ecurity, it was thought fit to &s;pare Sail: and therefore all the Sails except the fore-Sail, were furled, and the Ships head turned due Ea&s;t-South-Ea&s;t, lea&s;t we might run too near the Shoar, the Watch looking out &s;harp all night long, during which the Wind was very high and &s;tormy, which exceedingly to&s;&s;ed us.</P>

<P><HI>Wedne&s;day</HI> Morning <HI>February</HI> the &s;ixth, the Wind was &s;o violent, that we were afraid we &s;hould &s;ail our Ma&s;ts, becau&s;e the Stays were very &s;lack be|ing loo&s;ened by the force of the Wind the day before; (the Stay is a great Ca|ble that holds the Ma&s;traunt, each Ma&s;t has one: the main Stay which is the bigge&s;t, is made fa&s;t, one end to the &s;hip's head, and the other to the round top of the main Ma&s;t.) To prevent that di&s;a&s;ter, all the Sails were furled the &s;hip's head turned North-Ea&s;t, and a quarter of an hour after, the Stayes being well bent, we bore away We&s;t-South-We&s;t with the mi&s;&s;en and fore&s;ail: the Wind being a little fallen after dinner, we &s;pread the main Sail, and about &s;ix a Clock at Night, having tacked about, we &s;tood Ea&s;t-North-Ea&s;t, the Wind then &s;lackening more and more.</P>

<P><HI>Friday</HI> about two or three of the Clock in the Morning, immediately after the Moon was &s;et, the South-Ea&s;t Wind cea&s;ed, and the &s;o much de&s;ired We&s;t, and North Wind came in place of it, which made us turn the &s;hip's head South-Ea&s;t, and make all the &s;ail we could; but we made but little way for all that, the Wind being &s;o ea&s;ie that it was almo&s;t a calm: It continued &s;o till about five of the Clock at Night, and then the Wind changed to North-We&s;t, but was &s;o ea&s;ie that the Sea was very &s;mooth; about ten a Clock at Night the Wind chopping about to the North-We&s;t, in five or &s;ix hours time we made a great deal of way, there being very little or no Sea going, but the Wind fre&s;hened afterwards, and then we &s;pared &s;ail that we might not run to the Lee-ward of <HI>Alexandria;</HI> the &s;hip's head in the mean time lying &s;till South-Ea&s;t.</P>
<P><HI>Saturday</HI> Morning the Weather was very hazy, and a little after we were almo&s;t in a calm.

We &s;ailed South-South-We&s;t, till &s;ix at Night, when having tacked, we &s;tood away Ea&s;t-North-Ea&s;t. About midnight the Wind turned We&s;t-South-We&s;t, and we &s;teered our cour&s;e South-South-Ea&s;t, after an hours &s;ailing, we found the Water to be whiti&s;h, which made us think we were not far from <HI>Egypt,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Land of <HI>Egypt.</HI></NOTE> that being the onely mark that can be had; for the Land is &s;o low that one cannot make it till he be ju&s;t upon it, e&s;pecially when it is dark, as it was then, and that whitene&s;s is occa&s;ioned by the <HI>Nile,</HI> which carries it a great way into the Sea.</P>

In this manner we plied to and again a|gain&s;t our will; and it was our misfortune that we knew not where we were, onely becau&s;e we had not made the I&s;land of <HI>Candie,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">An errour of calculation in the &s;ailing.</NOTE> from whence with that Wind we might ea&s;ily have come to <HI>Alexandria</HI> in two Days and one Nights time; and the rea&s;on why we made it not plainly, was that the Ship had run two hundred Miles more than we had reckoned, and that when we thought our &s;elves to be at the beginning of <HI>Candie,</HI> we were al|mo&s;t quite pa&s;t it, as we &s;ince ob&s;erved.

<P>We held on the &s;ame cour&s;e &s;till untill <HI>Munday,</HI> when about eleven a Clock in the Fore-noon we tacked, and bore away South-We&s;t: In the Evening, the Moon three hours after the full was eclip&s;ed: I cannot tell at what hour that Eclip&s;e began, of how many parts it was, nor how long it con|tinued; becau&s;e &s;he ro&s;e overca&s;t with Clouds, &s;o that we could not &s;ee her but when &s;he was coming out of the Eclip&s;e; as near as I could gue&s;s &s;he had then been up near an hour, and the Sun had not been &s;et half an hour, at which time &s;he was almo&s;t half eclip&s;ed.

<P><HI>Tue&s;day</HI> morning the twelfth of <HI>February,</HI> we perceived the Sea very white about us, and he that looked out cryed <HI>Land,</HI> &s;ome thought it to be <HI>Damiette,</HI> and others <HI>Bouquer;</HI> In the mean time that we might not fall to the Lee ward, we continued our cour&s;e South-We&s;t. About eight of the Clock we tacked and &s;tood North Ea&s;t; and a quarter of an hour after the Wind turning North-We&s;t, we bore away We&s;t-South-We&s;t: after an hours &s;ailing we found the Water to be &s;o little bracki&s;h that it was almo&s;t fre&s;h, and he that looked out thought he made <HI>Ro&s;&s;etto:</HI> Wherefore thinking that we knew where we were, we tacked about and &s;tood away North-North-Ea&s;t.

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. II.</HI> Of &s;ome Curio&s;ities ob&s;erved during the Voyage, and in <HI>Alexandria.</HI></HEAD>
<P>IN this Voyage I was convinced of one thing which I had read in the Tra|vels of <HI>Mon&s;ieur de Breves,</HI> but could hardly believe it, becau&s;e I had ne|ver heard it mentioned by any but him; and that is that when &s;ounding up|on the Coa&s;t of <HI>Egypt,</HI> one has onely forty fathom water, it is certain he is ju&s;t forty miles from land,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Marks for knowing how near one is to Land upon the Coa&s;t of <HI>Egypt.</HI></NOTE> the depth of the water from forty fathom, down|wards to one, marking exactly the number of miles from the place where one &s;ounds to the Land: But under the name of the Coa&s;t of <HI>Egypt,</HI> we are onely to under&s;tand the Land from <HI>Damiette</HI> to <HI>Ro&s;&s;etto,</HI> betwixt the two Branches of the <HI>Nile;</HI> for this rule is onely for that extent of Land.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the <HI>Murenes</HI> I mentioned before, we took two other fi&s;h in our Voyage;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Porpe&s;s.</NOTE> to wit a <HI>Porpe&s;s</HI> which was taken with a Fi&s;h-gig above <HI>Malta</HI> over again&s;t <HI>Cape Pa&s;&s;aro;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Cape Pa&s;&s;aro.</NOTE> it was about five foot long, and almo&s;t as big as a man, without &s;cales, blacki&s;h in the back, and white in the belly; the head of it was about a foot and a half long, and a large foot over; its eyes as large as a mans; and betwixt the two eyes, it hath a hole like the mould in the head of a man, by which it &s;ucks in and &s;pouts out the Water, making it look like a Crown; it hath two Cheeks which are onely of fat two Inches thick, they begin at the eyes of it, and end almo&s;t round at the &s;nout, which from the Cheeks to the point is about five Inches long, and is &s;haped much like the beak of a Goo&s;e, the Tongue of it is white a finger thick and two fingers broad, it had an hundred three&s;core and &s;ixteen Teeth, all very &s;mall: Its tail &s;tands another way than the Tails of other fi&s;h which are forked upwards and down|wards an&s;wering to their back and belly, for the Tail of this is forked cro&s;s ways parallel to its two &s;ides: it hath the Yard and Te&s;ticles as big and long as tho&s;e of a Boar, and its Entrals wholly re&s;embling tho&s;e of Swine; its skin is all fat a finger thick, of which Lamp-oyl is made, the fle&s;h of it is like to that of an Oxe, and very good; I have ta&s;ted it, and by the &s;ight and ta&s;te, one would always take it for Beef; it hath onely great Bones and no &s;mall ones, abounds with bloud, which is as hot as that of a Bea&s;t; it moans and &s;ighs like a man, and dies not pre&s;ently when it is out of the Water, but beats furiou&s;ly with the Tail, wherein its greate&s;t &s;trength lies.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A Fi&s;h called <HI>Fanfre.</HI></NOTE>The other Fi&s;h which was al&s;o taken with a Fi&s;h-gig, is by the <HI>Provincials</HI> called <HI>Fanfre, and is probably the &s;ame which the Engli&s;h call the Pilot-Fi&s;h;</HI> there was two of them then together, but one e&s;caped the &s;troak. This Fi&s;h is &s;haped like a Mackerel, and is of the &s;ame length and bigne&s;s: I found nothing &s;ingular in it; all the back of it is begirt with &s;treaks two fingers broad, the one of a dark purple almo&s;t black, and the other blew, which interchangea|bly reach from the head to the Tail, and the belly of it is white. The Sea|men &s;ay that this Fi&s;h coming once up with a Ship, never leaves following till the &s;hip come to harbour; another being taken two days after, they all a&s;|&s;ured me that it was the companion of the fir&s;t which had not left off follow|ing the Ve&s;&s;el. After all, to my ta&s;te it is an excellent Fi&s;h, and &s;o it &s;eemed to all tho&s;e who had eaten of them formerly, and al&s;o ta&s;ted the&s;e.</P>
<P>Seeing there are but few things in <HI>Alexandria</HI> which I did not ob&s;erve in my former Travels, I gave my &s;elf no great trouble to charge my Memoires with them at this time. This Town lies exactly in the one and thirtieth degree of latitude, and <HI>Ro&s;&s;etto</HI> is one and thirty and a half, at lea&s;t, a Dutch Captain who had taken the height of them a&s;&s;ured me of it. The mo&s;t con&s;iderable piece of antiquity that &s;till remains there,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Pillar of <HI>Pompey.</HI></NOTE> is that famous Pillar of <HI>Pompey,</HI>
<PB N="7" REF="170">
whereof (as I remember) I have already written: Neverthele&s;s as I took plea|&s;ure to view it over and over again, &s;o, po&s;&s;ibly, the Curious will not take it ill that I impart to them my ob&s;ervations. I mea&s;ured the &s;hadow of it, at the time when &s;hadows are equal to the bodies which cau&s;e them, and I found the body of it to be three&s;core and fifteen foot high, without reckon|ing the Pede&s;tal and Corni&s;h; but the &s;hadow was upon a very declining ground: Another day when the &s;hadows were the double of the Bodies, I found near an hundred and three&s;core foot, onely of the body of it, and eight foot of diameter or breadth; and I ob&s;erved that the Pede&s;tal is near twelve foot high. All know that the Corni&s;h of this Pillar is of the <HI>Corinthian</HI> order.</P>
<P>The &s;ame day al&s;o I &s;aw &s;omething very remarkable, which I had not &s;uffi|ciently con&s;idered in my former Travels. Being abroad with &s;ome others by the gate <HI>Del Pepe,</HI> which looks betwixt South and We&s;t, about a thou&s;and paces from that gate, as we went betwixt South and We&s;t, &s;treight towards the <HI>Palus Mareotis,</HI> leaving the Pillar of <HI>Pompey</HI> to the left,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Burying pla|ces of the an|cient <HI>Egypti|ans.</HI></NOTE> we &s;aw Grotto's cut in the Rock: we entered into one of them, &s;tooping and leaning upon our hands, with lighted Wax-candles; being within we found that the Roof was above ten foot high, cut very &s;mooth, and on all &s;ides we &s;aw Sepulchres made in the Wall, which is the Rock it &s;elf; and of the&s;e there are four Sto|ries, one over another, and from one range to another, and from Story to Story, there is but half a foots di&s;tance; &s;o that the intervals &s;eem to be &s;o many Pillars, which &s;upport tho&s;e that are over them; their depth reaches to the bottom of the Sepulchres, and &s;o they &s;erve for Walls to &s;eparate the one from the other. In the&s;e Sepulchres we &s;aw many dead mens Bones which we handled, and found them to be as fre&s;h and hard as if the men had died but the day before: There were &s;ome lying upon the ground at the Entry into the Grotto, which had been thrown out there; I handled and broke &s;ome of them, and found that they were rotten in the air, but they crumbled not into a&s;hes, onely broke longways like rotten Elder, nay they were al&s;o moi&s;t, and had a kind of marrow within.</P>
<P>Coming out of that Grotto, we entered into another oppo&s;ite unto it, where we &s;aw Sepulchres as in the other: at the bottom we found a way that led very far in, but becau&s;e we mu&s;t have gone double, in the manner as we entered the fir&s;t Gotto, and marched in that po&s;ture at lea&s;t as far as we could &s;ee by the light of our Wax-candles; we thought be&s;t not to enter in, and be contented with the Relation we had, that it reached above two French Leagues in length. This was all that we could learn from the <HI>Turks</HI> who were with us, and who told us be&s;ides that the Ancient Inhabitants of <HI>Alex|andria</HI> had dugg tho&s;e places to lay their dead in; there is a great deal of pro|bability of the truth of that, and that it has been &s;ome burying-place. I then con&s;idered the <HI>Palus Mareotis:</HI> it reaches in breadth out of &s;ight,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Palus Mareo|tis. Khalis.</NOTE> and is but &s;ome hundred of paces di&s;tant from the <HI>Khalis,</HI> which hath its cour&s;e betwixt the &s;ame <HI>Palus Mareotis</HI> and the Pillar of <HI>Pompey;</HI> but they have no commu|nication together.</P>
<P>Another day I went up to the Hill, where the Tower is, wherein there is commonly a Watchman, to put out the Flag &s;o &s;oon as any Ve&s;&s;el appears:<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Watch-Tower.</NOTE> from thence I ea&s;ily di&s;covered all the City and the Sea, with the <HI>Palus Ma|reotis,</HI> and all the Countrey about: Being come down I went on Foot round the Ancient Walls of <HI>Alexandria,</HI> beginning at the Water-gate,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The circuit of <HI>Alexandria.</HI></NOTE> that looks to the North, and for &s;ome time going &s;treight North, till the Wall turns off in a right Angle, towards the Ea&s;t; and after fifty paces length, turns again to|wards the North, making there an obtu&s;e Angle: it continues &s;o towards the North, till you come over again&s;t the Palace of <HI>Cleopatra,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Palace of <HI>Cleopatra.</HI></NOTE> which &s;tood upon the Walls oppo&s;ite to the mouth of the Harbour, having a Gallery running out|wards &s;upported by many fair Pillars, of which &s;ome remains are &s;till to be &s;een on the Sea-&s;ide: That Gallery (they &s;ay, and not without probability) reached even into the Palace, &s;o that one might embark there.</P>
<P>In a Tower hard by, are to be &s;een three Pillars &s;tanding, which &s;upport a little Dome, that in former times &s;tood upon four, but there is one wanting; I cannot conceive for what u&s;e that little Dome was, being in a place where
<PB N="8" REF="171">
there is no light; perhaps it &s;tood over &s;ome Ci&s;tern which at pre&s;ent is &s;topt up. Ten or twelve &s;teps from that Tower, there is a Ci&s;tern, where there are two Stories of Pillars, and in many other places there are Ci&s;terns &s;uppor|ted in the &s;ame manner;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ci&s;terns upon Pillars. Obelisks.</NOTE> &s;o that it would &s;eem that mo&s;t part of the Town hath &s;tood upon Pillars.</P>
<P>A few &s;teps from thence there are to be &s;een two Obelisks of Thebaick Stones, one of which lies buried in the Earth, nothing of it but the foot appearing; the other is &s;tanding, but the Earth mu&s;t needs be rai&s;ed very high in that place, for in all probability that Obelisk is upon its pede&s;tal, of which nothing is to be &s;een, nay not the foot of the Obelisk it &s;elf.</P>
<P>Oppo&s;ite to this place, the Wall turns again towards the Ea&s;t, and with the other plane makes almo&s;t a returning right Angle, and after a con&s;iderable &s;pace doubles inwards, making a &s;quare; but an hundred paces farther it runs out again a pretty way towards the North-Ea&s;t, and &s;tretches North|wards; then making a &s;harp Angle, it points betwixt Ea&s;t and South-Ea&s;t|ward, as far as the Gate of <HI>Ro&s;&s;ette,</HI> after which it maketh an obtu&s;e Angle and reaches along betwixt the We&s;t and South-We&s;t. Along that &s;ide runs the <HI>Khalis;</HI> and a little farther is the <HI>Palus Mareotis</HI> parallel unto it, which is &s;o broad that one can hardly &s;ee Land on the other &s;ide of it. When we come over again&s;t the Pillar of <HI>Pompey,</HI> which &s;tands to the South of the Town on this &s;ide the <HI>Khalis,</HI> we find the Gate <HI>del Pepe</HI> or <HI>Sitre,</HI> which looks to the South-We&s;t and We&s;t; and then the Wall which is doubled inwards in this place, to make the Gate, continues on towards the South-We&s;t and We&s;t, as far as a New Ca&s;tle, which &s;eems to be very &s;trong, and near to which, a little from the Gate <HI>del Pepe,</HI> the <HI>Khalis</HI> enters under the Wall into the con|duits of the City, from which all have Water into their Ci&s;terns by means of <HI>Pou&s;&s;eragues.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Aqueducts.</NOTE>Afterwards the Wall turns &s;treight North, and pa&s;&s;es along the old Harbour, oppo&s;ite to which, on the right hand, are to be &s;een the <HI>Aqueducts,</HI> which heretofore conveyed the Water of the <HI>Khalis</HI> from the Ca&s;tle of the old Har|bour, to <HI>Bouquer.</HI> Then the Wall runs &s;treight betwixt North-Ea&s;t and North to the Water-Gate. We were two hours in going the compa&s;s of <HI>Alexan|dria,</HI> which reaches in length from Ea&s;t to We&s;t, but is very narrow.</P>

On Board of that <HI>Germe</HI> there was a <HI>Cor&s;ar</HI> of <HI>Barbary</HI> who had long followed that cour&s;e, and had a Ship of his own in <HI>Alexandria;</HI> That man who had &s;een a great many French men, nay and had had &s;everal of them in his power, would not believe that I was one; but a&s;&s;ured me that one would always take me for a <HI>Levantine,</HI> ra|ther than a French man: I was not at all troubled to find that I was &s;o well di&s;gui&s;ed, for in travelling through <HI>Turky,</HI> it is good to have &s;o much of the Air of the Countrey, that we may not be taken for &s;trangers, unle&s;s we plea&s;e. Next day about five of the clock in the morning we &s;et out, and about ten of the clock entred the Channel of <HI>Nile,</HI> where we found a man in a Boat, who put us in our way:<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Channel of <HI>Nile.</HI></NOTE> though there be Canes fixed at &s;everal di&s;tances to &s;hew where the Shelves are, yet there is need of &s;uch a man for a guide; becau&s;e the River bringing a great deal of &s;and with it, the pa&s;&s;ages are daily choaked up,

which were navigable two hours before; and on the contrary, wa&s;hing away I&s;lands, which it had made, and which appeared to be out of reach of the Wa|ter, it makes ways for Ve&s;&s;els, in places where before one might have walked dry &s;hod; and this mans bu&s;ine&s;s is to &s;ound every hour of the day, that &s;o he may be able to &s;hew the right Channel; and the Ma&s;ters of the <HI>Germes</HI> pay him for his pains.</P>
<P>At noon we came to <HI>Ro&s;&s;etto,</HI> where I &s;aw manner the of making Sorbet,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Ro&s;&s;etto.</HI> The way of making <HI>Sor|bet.</HI></NOTE> whil&s;t I &s;taid there. They made u&s;e of an hundred and fifty <HI>Rottes</HI> of Sugar broken into &s;mall pieces, which they put into a great Kettle over a Fire, with a little water to di&s;&s;olve it, when it was ready to boil, they skimmed it, and poured in five or &s;ix quarts more of water, to make the skum ri&s;e better; they put it in by &s;poonfulls, and wet the &s;ides of the Kettle to cool them. Half an hour af|ter they mingled a dozen whites of Eggs, with four or five quarts of water, and having beat them a little with the water, all was poured into the Kettle at four or five times, and then they began to skim again, till a little after, they &s;trained it through a Cloath, and that they call clarifying of the Sugar. Af|terwards they divided that Liquor into three parts, of which they put a third into a great Kettle or Caldron over the fire; and &s;eeing that Sugar from time to time was like to boil over, they made it &s;ettle, by throwing in two or three Egg-&s;hels full of Milk. When they knew it to be boiled enough, after it had been an hour upon the fire, they took it off; it looked then very yellow, and two men &s;et a &s;tirring of it with wooden peels; &s;o that the more they &s;tirred it, as it grew cold it became the thicker and whiter. When it was a little thickened; they put into it about two gla&s;s-fulls of the juice of Limon boiled; as I &s;hall tell you hereafter: Then they &s;tirred it again to mingle all well to|gether, and a little after they put into it about two &s;poonfulls of Ro&s;e-water in which &s;ome Musk had been di&s;&s;olved, &s;everal adding thereto Ambergrea&s;s. Then again they &s;tirred it till it became like a Pa&s;te, and afterwards put it in|to Pots; the &s;ame they did with the other two parts. With an hundred and fifty of the&s;e <HI>Rottes</HI> they filled twenty nine Pots; therein they &s;pent a little Bottle of Ro&s;e-water, with Musk which co&s;t a Crown. When they have a mind to make it of a violet-Colour, after the juice of Limon, they put of the Syrrup of Violets into it, which is made by pounding Violets with Sugar, which they clear from the dreggs. To make the juice of Limons, a great many Limons are pre&s;&s;ed, and the juice expre&s;&s;ed, boiled in a Kettle; but the Kettle mu&s;t be full, and boil along while untill the juice be reduced to the quantity of &s;ix or &s;even quarts; In the mean time they burn above an hun|dred weight of Wood, and cannot boil above two Kettle-fulls a day, that is, above ten or twelve quarts; it is of a blacki&s;h red colour, &s;harp and bitter.</P>
<P>In the <HI>De&s;ta,</HI> over again&s;t <HI>Ro&s;&s;etto</HI> and as far as <HI>Damiette,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">De&s;ta.</NOTE> there is plenty of fine Fowl, which the people of the Countrey call Garden-Cocks,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dic elgait, <HI>Garden-Cocks.</HI></NOTE> that is in <HI>Arabick, Dic elgait:</HI> they are as big as ordinary Pullets, having the Belly and Wings of a violet-colour above and black below, the Head and Neck of a violet-colour, the Back greeni&s;h brown, a Tale like a Wood-Cock, which is white underneath, a long Beak like a Parrot, and a little crooked, but of a lovely red colour; it reaches from the Crown of the Head, where there is a kind of a flat Plate of the &s;ame &s;tuff, and all looks like Horn; their feet are as big as Pullets feet, but longer and are red, but of a paler red than the Beak; they keep in the Mar&s;hes.</P>
<P>At <HI>Ro&s;&s;etto</HI> I found a bark bound for <HI>Baruth,</HI> but becau&s;e there were Soldi|ers ready to go to <HI>Candia,</HI> they &s;uffered no Sail to put out, lea&s;t the Chri&s;ti+ans might have advice of it. At length the Soldiers being gone for <HI>Alexan|dria,</HI> our bark; wherein the <HI>Aga</HI> of the Ca&s;tle of <HI>Ro&s;&s;etto</HI> had a &s;hare,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Departure from <HI>Ro&s;&s;etto.</HI></NOTE> was &s;uffered privately to depart: So that <HI>Munday</HI> the nineteenth of <HI>March</HI> about nine of the Clock in the Morning we put out. When we were almo&s;t at the mouth of the River, we were forced to &s;end out the Boat on head to drop an Anchor &s;everal times, that &s;o we might tow our &s;elves, till about Noon being got out of the River, with a We&s;t-South-We&s;t Wind we made all the &s;ail we could and bore away North-Ea&s;t. Three hours after we &s;teered an Ea&s;t and be South cour&s;e, the Wind having &s;hifted about to South-We&s;t, though it was &s;o &s;mall that we were almo&s;t becalmed. In the Night-time we &s;aw a great
<PB N="10" REF="172">
deal of Lightning at a di&s;tance from us, and then the Wind blowing fre&s;her from South, we &s;tood away Ea&s;t-North-Ea&s;t. It is unea&s;ie to me to give a relation of this Voyage,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An Idle &s;hip's Crew.</NOTE> &s;o much it vexed me, our Crew con&s;i&s;ted of fifteen men, who did nothing but &s;leep till Noon, and after they had quarrelled to|gether at Dinner, fell a &s;inging and playing, and would not vouch&s;afe to &s;tir, too look out aloft, pump the &s;hip, or to do any other &s;ervice. All that I could get of them during the whole Voyage was once to pump the Ve&s;&s;el. They had nothing to throw out the Water with but the Neck of a Bottle, and if the Ve&s;&s;el made but the lea&s;t Travel, they thought them&s;elves lo&s;t. One Night wheh we had bad Weather, the Ve&s;&s;el rowling to and again, three or four times they were upon the point of launching the Boat, and for&s;aking the Ve&s;&s;el, which &s;tood in need of nothing, but a little Vigilance. They had no Sea-Cart to &s;et off their Cour&s;e by; and when I asked them where we were, they made me an&s;wer, that they could not tell, after &s;o much tacking. At every turn they &s;aid to me <HI>Allah Kerim,</HI> that's to &s;ay, God is great, tel|ling me with all that once they had made that Voyage being but one Night out at Sea. Among&s;t them there was no di&s;tinction of Ma&s;ter, they jeered and abu&s;ed one another openly, and no body could hinder it. The <HI>Reis</HI> ne|ver commanded any thing to be done, but with tears almo&s;t in his Eyes, and &s;tamping with his foot like a Child; &s;o that we &s;eemed to be utterly lo&s;t; and indeed, they all made a fool of him, and imitating his voice bid one another do what he ordered, without &s;tirring in the lea&s;t. In &s;hort I believe the&s;e Blades had never been at Sea in a &s;torm, going and coming commonly, as they told me, in fair Weather.</P>
<P><HI>Tue&s;day</HI> and all <HI>Wedne&s;day</HI> almo&s;t, we had &s;ucce&s;&s;ively Ea&s;t and South-Ea&s;t Winds, which made us bear away North-North-Ea&s;t: at length on <HI>Wedne&s;|day</HI> about ten of the Clock at Night the Wind turned We&s;terly, and we bore away Ea&s;t-North-Ea&s;t.</P>
<P>Next day being exactly mid-lent, the &s;ame Wind blew tempe&s;tuou&s;ly, and the Sea being very rough, we rowled &s;o as every moment we were like to be over&s;et: The sky was extremely overca&s;t on all hands, and among&s;t other fierce gu&s;ts which we met with from time to time, we had one about half an hour after five in the Evening, wherein we had like to have been ca&s;t away. Seeing the&s;e lazy Lubbards &s;aw it a coming, they took the pains to furle the main &s;ail, and left none abroad but the &s;prit-&s;ail, whil&s;t that &s;torm la&s;ted we were darkned, as if we had been under &s;ome great Vault, it la&s;ted almo&s;t half an hour with great violence, and in the mean time all were very &s;ilent. To what hand &s;oever we looked, we &s;aw nothing but &s;tormy Clouds, and this was &s;till following us, neverthele&s;s when it was almo&s;t &s;pent, we made <HI>Mount Carmel:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Mount</HI> Car|mel. Acre.</NOTE> Immediately we bore away Ea&s;t, and &s;ailed with VVind in poop towards <HI>Acre,</HI> but having no more but about half an hour of day, and it being impo&s;&s;ible, all the diligence we could u&s;e, to come up with it, be|fore it were an hour after Night, we tacked about and &s;tood North, for fear of running a ground. In the Night-time we had many furious gu&s;ts, and a great deal of Lightning. A little before that great &s;torme I have been men|tioning fell, we &s;aw about two hundred paces from us a Flock of little red Birds flying,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Red Birds.</NOTE> I thought at fir&s;t that the reflexion of the Sun made them look to be of that Colour; but &s;eeing it continued &s;o long as they were in &s;ight, and that the Sun was overca&s;t, I concluded that it mu&s;t be their natural Colour.</P>
<P><HI>Friday</HI> morning the two and twentieth of <HI>March</HI> we had &s;till &s;everal Flur|ries; however (the Weather clearing up a little,) we &s;teered our cour&s;e Ea&s;t-North-Ea&s;t, and about Noon pa&s;&s;ed by <HI>Saide</HI> in our way to <HI>Baruth</HI> which is twenty miles di&s;tant from it.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Baruth.</NOTE> But when we were near the <HI>Cape</HI> of <HI>Baruth,</HI> the Wind chopping about to North-We&s;t, we were forced to tack about and &s;tand away South-South-We&s;t that we might put in to <HI>Saide,</HI> &s;ince we could not get to <HI>Baruth,</HI> and that was lucky for us; for we were told at <HI>Saide,</HI> that there was a <HI>Cor&s;air</HI> about <HI>Baruth,</HI> into who&s;e hands we mu&s;t have fallen if we had continued our cour&s;e that way. So &s;oon as I came a-&s;hore the Cu&s;tomer who was in his Office, called me to him, and having asked me who I was, I told him I was a <HI>Franck,</HI> which he would not believe; untill a <HI>Turk</HI> who un|der&s;tood
<PB N="11" REF="172">
<HI>Italian,</HI> having asked me what I was, and I an&s;wered him in the &s;ame Language that I was a <HI>Frenchman,</HI> he acquainted the Officer of the Cu&s;tome-hou&s;e with it. I went and lodged at the hou&s;e of the <HI>Chevalier D' Ervieu;</HI> who made me very welcome, and took the pains him&s;elf to go and &s;ee my rhings brought a &s;hore which he cleared at the Cu&s;tome-hou&s;e without any co&s;t to me: I received &s;o many Civilities from him during my &s;tay in that Town, that I wi&s;h I were able to publi&s;h all the World over, that he is one of the mo&s;t gallant and obliging Gentlemen living.</P>
<P><HI>Saide</HI> is a &s;mall Town very ill built,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Saide.</NOTE> having a good Ca&s;tle &s;tanding upon a Rock in the Sea, oppo&s;ite to the Town; it is an I&s;land and &s;eparated from the Land by a Bridge of ten or twelve Arches. The Port which is at the &s;ide of that Ca&s;tle is incon&s;iderable, and there is another better clo&s;e by the Town; But the <HI>Emir Eecardin</HI> being one day at <HI>Saide,</HI> and fearing that the Galleys which came for the Grand Seignior's money might &s;erve him &s;ome ugly trick, he cau&s;ed the Entry of it to be &s;topt up; to the end the incommodiou&s;|ne&s;s of the other Port might oblige them to ha&s;ten their departure. A few &s;teps from thence in a Garden, there is a little Chappel, in which there is a Tomb with two Stones erected over it; the People of the Countrey &s;ay it is the Sepulchre of <HI>Zebulon,</HI> and that the di&s;tance of the two Stones &s;hews the length of his Body; if it be &s;o, he mu&s;t have been a very proper man, for the&s;e Stones are about ten foot di&s;tant one from another. It is but three years &s;ince there was a <HI>Ba&s;ha</HI> at <HI>Saide,</HI> formerly it was governed by a <HI>Vaivode,</HI> but the <HI>Sangiacat</HI> of <HI>Sefet</HI> hath been annexed to <HI>Saide</HI> and its dependances, and both together erected into a Ba&s;ha&s;hip. The day that I departed I &s;aw the Ba&s;ha enter the Town, he was attended by about three hundred Hor&s;e-men well mounted and armed, &s;ome with Carabines, and others with Bows, Ar|rows and Buckler, and all with a &s;hable by their &s;ide: in the rear of the company there were a great many Players on Tymbrels, Hoboys, and &s;uch like In&s;truments; among&s;t the re&s;t one kept time by knocking two little Plates of Copper one again&s;t another.</P>
<P>The chief Traffick of <HI>Saide</HI> con&s;i&s;ts in Silk, and therefore there is abun|dance of Mulberry-trees in the Fields about, and &s;o &s;oon as they can get but a little piece of a Rock, if they can make two fingers breadth of Earth hold upon it, there they plant a Mulberry-tree at <HI>Saide.</HI> I bargained with a <HI>Mou|cre</HI> or <HI>Moukir</HI> to carry me to <HI>Dama&s;cus. Moucre</HI> comes from the <HI>Arabick</HI> word <HI>Kira,</HI> which &s;ignifies to let, to hire, as one would &s;ay a letter out of Bea&s;ts to hire. He was to furni&s;h me with a Hor&s;e for my &s;elf, and two Mules,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The charge of pa&s;&s;age from <HI>Saide</HI> to <HI>Da|ma&s;cus.</HI></NOTE> one for my Servant and another for my Baggage; be&s;ides he obliged him&s;elf to clear me of all the <HI>Caffares,</HI> and I payed him &s;ixteen Bockels and a half.</P>
<P><HI>Tue&s;day</HI> the five and twentieth of <HI>March</HI> about eleven of the Clock in the Fore-noon, I parted from <HI>Saide;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Departure from <HI>Saide.</HI></NOTE> we came to our lodging at <HI>Labatia</HI> about five a Clock in the Evening: we travelled all day long mounting through very good Corn-fields, and the re&s;t of the ground by the road that was not &s;owed, was covered over with Daffadils and Furzes in the blo&s;&s;om,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Daffadils and Furzes.</NOTE> with other like &s;hrubs that yielded a very plea&s;ant pro&s;pect. So &s;oon as we were arri|ved, a <HI>Tchorbadgi</HI> of <HI>Dama&s;cus,</HI> encamping hard by under a Tent, being infor|med of the <HI>Moucre</HI> that there was a <HI>Franck</HI> there, &s;ent for me; and having treated me with Coffee, asked me if I had any relation to <HI>Mon&s;ieur Bermond</HI> a Chirurgeon of <HI>Mar&s;eilles,</HI> who negotiated &s;ome Affairs at <HI>Dama&s;cus</HI> for the Merchants of <HI>Saide:</HI> I told him I was, without mentioning in what degree, for our Kindred is onely derived from the Patriarch <HI>Noah.</HI> He told me that he was his friend, and made me to under&s;tand &s;everal times, that if I had a mind to buy a&s;hes, he would be my merchant; but all my an&s;wer was that I was too poor to be a Merchant, and that my bu&s;ine&s;s was to go to my Kin&s;man.</P>
<P><HI>Labatia</HI> is a mi&s;erable little Village, where we could not find lodging,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Labatia.</NOTE> and the be&s;t accommodation we had to lie in, was a little place at the end whereof there was a pane of a Wall; our Mules were made fa&s;t hard by, and we po&s;ted our &s;elves near the Wall in the open Air.</P>
<P>Next day being <HI>Wedne&s;day</HI> the twenty &s;ixth of <HI>March;</HI> we parted about five in the Morning, the ground being frozen with a &s;harp cold Wind. Our
<PB N="12" REF="173">
way was bad and &s;till upwards; and we &s;oon came in &s;ight of a Ca&s;tle upon a high hill before us,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Ca&s;tle of <HI>Skheip. Sefet,</HI> a Town.</NOTE> which is called <HI>Skheip,</HI> and is pretty large and &s;quare; it depends on <HI>Sefet</HI> which is but two days Journey from it: That Ca&s;tle is &s;trong by &s;cituation, for it is inacce&s;&s;ible, but yet was inhabited. VVe left it to the right, and went a great way to find out a de&s;cent into a place, from whence we &s;aw a very deep Valley, where a River runs, which they call <HI>Leitani,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Leitani,</HI> a Ri|ver.</NOTE> that makes many turnings and windings; it is at lea&s;t five fathom broad and very rapid. During a quarter of an hour we de&s;cended by a very dangerous way; for the lea&s;t fal&s;e &s;tep was enough to make one tumble down into the River, and that from a great height too. Being come down we kept along that VVater, following the current, and a little from thence cro&s;|&s;ed it upon a &s;tone-Bridge of two Arches, about three fathom high, which is called <HI>Hardala.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">A Caffare at <HI>Hardala.</HI></NOTE> There, Pa&s;&s;engers pay a <HI>Pia&s;tre</HI> and a half a head, I mean the Chri&s;tians, for <HI>Turks</HI> do not pay &s;o much. Having pa&s;&s;ed the Bridge, we &s;tood off a little from the VVater, &s;till a&s;cending, and had in view the Hill that we had left on the other &s;ide, which appeared plea&s;anter unto us than when we were upon it; for it was very high and &s;treight and all covered o|ver with Trees. After we had travelled about half an hour in ways where it would have been very dangerous to fall; we came ju&s;t over again&s;t the Ca&s;tle of <HI>Skheip,</HI> which is upon a very high and &s;teep Hill: Some time after we came into a Plain, and an hour after to another far larger, but uncultiva|ted and full of &s;tones as the former was, though both looked very green. In this Plain we met a <HI>Caravan</HI> of Camels loaded each with a Mill-&s;tone; I was told that the&s;e &s;tones came from <HI>Oran,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Oran.</NOTE> which is five days Journey from thence, and that they carried them to <HI>Saide,</HI> to be tran&s;ported into <HI>Egypt.</HI> Having pa&s;t that Plain, we came over bad way to a &s;tone Bridge of three Arches lying over a Brook four or five fathom broad; when we had cro&s;&s;ed it, we mounted by a wor&s;e way, full of &s;tones bad enough to make Mules that were not loaded to break their Necks: and that la&s;ted till we came to our Lodging at <HI>Banias,</HI> where we arrived two hours after, during all that way, be&s;ides &s;tones we had a great many torrents and &s;uch dirty deep ground, that the Mules often &s;tuck.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Banias.</NOTE>This Village of <HI>Banias</HI> is very incon&s;iderable, neverthele&s;s when hereto|fore the Chri&s;tians were Ma&s;ters of it, it was a good Town: it lies at the foot of a Hill, on the top whereof there is a great Ca&s;tle uninhabited; this place depends on the Ba&s;ha of <HI>Dama&s;cus.</HI> VVe found no better Lodging here than the Night before, for having cro&s;&s;ed a &s;quare Court, we entered under a Vault two foot deep of Hor&s;e-dung and du&s;t mingled together; our Lodging was appointed us in that place, and &s;eeing the Court was vaulted all round, under which they had put the Mules, and a Caravan of A&s;&s;es; we were &s;o incommoded there, that &s;o &s;oon as the Bea&s;ts began to &s;tir, they rai|&s;ed a du&s;t that &s;poilt all the Victuals we had prepared to eat; all the plea&s;ure we had, came from a little door that opened towards the &s;ide of a River that runs by it, and which is at lea&s;t three fathom broad, but very &s;hallow, though it be rapid: it is called the River of <HI>Banias.</HI></P>
<P>Next morning about five a Clock, we left that na&s;ty Lodging, and after about an hours mounting upwards, turning by very bad ways, (though the Land about was &s;owed;) we found our&s;elves ju&s;t oppo&s;ite to our Lodging, ha|ving betwixt us and it a very deep Valley, agreeable by its verdure, and the many Trees it is filled with, which are watered by a River that runs through it. A little after we &s;aw the Ca&s;tle of <HI>Banias</HI> in its full extent, which is large and &s;trong. VVe &s;till mounted during the &s;pace of an hour by ways that were better than the former; but we had the lovely Valley always in &s;ight, and on the road there were a great many Trees, which by their verdure and &s;hade le&s;&s;ened &s;omewhat of the fatigue: The truth is there was no fal&s;e &s;tep to be made there, becau&s;e the way being very &s;mooth and &s;lopeing to the very bottom of the Valley, one could not &s;top before he came to the bottom. By the way we found many wild Che&s;tnut-trees withered and without leaves, and yet bearing their fruit. Having de&s;cended a little, we entered into a large Plain; and having pa&s;&s;ed it, and mounted a little among&s;t Trees, we found &s;tony Plains, where it behoved us to march on untill about three of
<PB N="13" REF="173">
the Clock after Noon, in the wor&s;t way imaginable; for they were all great &s;tones, among&s;t which there was no place for a Mule to &s;et his foot. After Noon it was a little better, but we &s;aw no &s;owed Land, all the ground about being &s;till full of a prodigious number of &s;tones. Neverthele&s;s our <HI>Monkires</HI> would needs have me believe that heretofore Vines had grown there: Indeed, in &s;everal places there are &s;till to be &s;een &s;ome Hovels like to Hen-hou&s;es, made of &s;tones piled one upon another, where it might be thought that they who dre&s;&s;ed the Vines retired; but &s;ince that time &s;ome <HI>Medu&s;a's</HI> head mu&s;t needs have pa&s;t over the&s;e grounds; or the Earth hath brought forth &s;tones in&s;tead of Grapes. Having travelled in this manner till towards three of the Clock in the Afternoon; we found a Village called <HI>Kefarhevar,</HI> where,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Kefarhevar,</HI> a Village.</NOTE> our <HI>Moukires</HI> be|ing in the humour to tell &s;tories, told me that. Heretofore <HI>Nimrod</HI> dwelt there, and that from thence he &s;hot Arrows again&s;t Heaven. VVe pa&s;t that Village, and having de&s;cended into a Valley, and then mounted a little up again, we came to Village called <HI>Beitima,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Beitima,</HI> a Village.</NOTE> where we took up our Lodging in a noble &s;table, for in it was a place of Earth rai&s;ed two foot high, to make a &s;eparate appartment for the men from the Bea&s;ts,</P>
<P>Next day being <HI>Friday</HI> the eight and twentieth of <HI>March</HI> we &s;et out half an hour after five in the Morning: At fir&s;t we did nothing but mount and de&s;|cend during the &s;pace of two hours, afterwards we entered into a great plain full of &s;tones, except in &s;ome places that were &s;owed, and that plain reaches as far as <HI>Dama&s;cus.</HI> There are a great many Villages in it,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Many Villages in the Terri|tory of <HI>Dama&s;|cus.</HI></NOTE> and at fir&s;t we &s;aw one called <HI>Catana,</HI> about half a <HI>French</HI> League to the left of us: Then we pa&s;t near to another called <HI>Artous;</HI> a little after we perceived one to our right hand named <HI>Mahtamia,</HI> and &s;o a great many more: after that we left the High-way that leads to the Town, and &s;truck off to the left, till we came to a great Village called <HI>Soliman,</HI> and from thence to another named <HI>Salaia,</HI> which was the Village of our <HI>Moukires,</HI> where they would have had me to lodge, had I not kept a great clutter with them; the&s;e Blades go commonly to that Village to change their Bea&s;ts.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Circuit of the Town.</NOTE>I went round the City on the out&s;ide of the Walls, in an hour and a quar|ter walking pretty fa&s;t; but the Suburbs are as big again as the Town, and among&s;t others the <HI>Baboullah,</HI> a Suburbs without the Gate <HI>Jabie</HI> reaches three or four Miles in length. It is called <HI>Baboullah,</HI> as one would &s;ay the divine Gate; becau&s;e that way goes the pre&s;ent which is &s;ent from <HI>Dama&s;cus</HI> to <HI>Mecha.</HI> In &s;urrounding the place I ob&s;erved that the Walls are not to be &s;een on the out&s;ide, but from <HI>Bab-Tchiaour</HI> pa&s;&s;ing before <HI>Bab-Charki,</HI> and then before <HI>Bab-Thomas,</HI> to <HI>Bab-&s;alem,</HI> the re&s;t being covered with Hou&s;es from <HI>Bab-Tchiaour,</HI> to <HI>Bab-Thomas</HI> the VValls are double, well built and very high, having fair Battlements, flanked at &s;everal di&s;tances with good Towers, for the mo&s;t part round; &s;ome are &s;quare, but of them there are but few. The Inner-walls are about four fathom high: The outer which are at &s;ome two fathoms di|&s;tance from them, are about three fathom and a half high, and the &s;pace be|tween ls filled up wlth Earth near four or five foot thick.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The length of <HI>Dama&s;cus.</HI></NOTE>I once mea&s;ured the length of the City; that's to &s;ay, from <HI>Bab-Charki</HI> to <HI>Bab-Jabie</HI> which is the <HI>Streight-street;</HI> I was a quarter of an hour in walking it, and reckoned two thou&s;and one hundred paces.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The hou&s;e of <HI>Ananias.</HI></NOTE>Let us take a view of the particular places and things. That which fir&s;t of all Travellers vi&s;it at <HI>Dama&s;cus,</HI> is the Hou&s;e of <HI>Ananias,</HI> which is inhabited by a <HI>Scheik:</HI> I went thither with &s;ome friends, and for &s;ome a&s;pres we were &s;uffered to enter in. Having pa&s;&s;ed the gate, and turned to the left hand, by fourteen &s;teps we de&s;cended into a Cellar, which heretofore was a Church, &s;eeled and paved with Mo&s;aick work, of which &s;ome remains are &s;till to be &s;een in the Pavements; at pre&s;ent it is a Mo&s;que, and light enough to be &s;o deep under ground: that place as they &s;ay, was the Chamber where <HI>Ananias</HI> lodged, when God commanded him to go to <HI>Saul;</HI> as it is related in the Acts of the Apo&s;tles.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Bab-Charki</HI> the Ea&s;t gate. St. <HI>Paul</HI>'s gate The beginning of the <HI>Streight-&s;treet.</HI> The Gate <HI>Jaby.</HI></NOTE>Having vi&s;ited that hou&s;e, wherein there is nothing curious be&s;ides the Antiquity of it, we went to the Gate called <HI>Bab-Charki,</HI> that's to &s;ay the Ea&s;t-Gate; it is likewi&s;e called <HI>St. Pauls Gate,</HI> becau&s;e it is near the place where that Holy Apo&s;tle was let down from the walls in a Basket. At that Gate begins the <HI>Streight-&s;treet,</HI> mentioned in Holy Scripture, which reaches as far as the Gate <HI>Jabie.</HI></P>
<P>When we were pa&s;t that Gate we turned to the right hand, and having advanced a few paces; we &s;aw in one of the &s;quare Towers, which are in the City-VVall, about two fathom high, two Free-&s;tones, on each of which there is a Flower-de-luce very well cut; there is a third with an In&s;cription in <HI>Lingua Franca;</HI> but the Characters are &s;o worn out, that they cannot be read. Upon two other &s;tones at the &s;ide of each Flower de-luce, there are two Lions cut, and near to each Lion a great Thi&s;tle. Some will needs be|lieve that the <HI>French</HI> built that Tower, which is not impo&s;&s;ible; but it is more probable that the <HI>Turks</HI> have brought the&s;e &s;tones ready cut and carved from <HI>Banias,</HI> or &s;ome other place which had been po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the <HI>French,</HI> and which the <HI>Turks</HI> had demoli&s;hed; for they are lazy enough, to chu&s;e rather to bring &s;tones ready cut from a far, than to be at the pains to cut them up|on the places. After that we &s;aw in the Fields about &s;ome hundreds of paces off, the places where the Chri&s;tians and Jews are buried; every Religion how|ever having their burying-place at &s;ome di&s;tance apart.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Burying-place.</NOTE></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Tomb of St. <HI>George.</HI></NOTE>Being gone &s;ome paces from the VValls, we came to the place where St. <HI>George</HI> the Porter was &s;toned by the Jews, who accu&s;ed him of having &s;aved St. <HI>Paul.</HI> That place is, as it were, a Court, in the middle whereof is the Tomb of that Saint; it is of Free-&s;tone, and covered with a little Pavillion in form of a Pyramid, and below there is a little opening, wherein the Chri&s;ti|ans commonly keep a burning Lamp; their Devotion is great at that place, and is even imitated by the <HI>Turks,</HI> who affirm as well as the Chri&s;tians, that
<PB N="15" REF="174">
Miracles are daily wrought there, and that &s;everal &s;ick <HI>Turks,</HI> having &s;pent a Night in that place, have next Morning come out in perfect health: On that Saint's Holy day, many People, Men, Women and Children, a&s;well <HI>Turks</HI> as <HI>Chri&s;tians</HI> repair to that Tomb. At the entry into the Court where it is, on the left hand, there is a place de&s;igned for burying of tho&s;e who die for the Faith of <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t;</HI> and when any Chri&s;tian departs, his body is fir&s;t brought to that place, where having &s;aid the office for the dead, it is carried to the place appointed for its burial.</P>
<P>Being come out of that place we kept &s;treight along by the City-Walls;<NOTE PLACE="marg">The place where St. <HI>Paul</HI> was let down.</NOTE> and &s;hortly after came to the place where St. <HI>Paul</HI> was let down in a Basket over the VVall.

<P>Afterwards we returned into the City by the Gate called <HI>Bab-Tchiaour,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Bab-Tchiaour.</NOTE> we went into the &s;treight-Street, and following it, came into a very large fair <HI>Bazar,</HI> covered with a high ridged Timber-roof, and full of &s;hops on both &s;ides; it is called the <HI>Bazar</HI> of &s;tuffs becau&s;e nothing el&s;e is &s;old there;<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Bazar</HI> of Stuffs. <HI>Rotte</HI> of <HI>Da|ma&s;cus.</HI></NOTE> and I learned by the by that the <HI>Rotte</HI> of <HI>Dama&s;cus</HI> is a weight an&s;wering to five <HI>French</HI> pounds.</P>
<P>Having cro&s;&s;ed over half of that <HI>Bazar,</HI> which is very long, we &s;truck off to the left hand, and through a little &s;treet went to the hou&s;e of <HI>Judas,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The hou&s;e of <HI>Judas.</HI></NOTE> which is clo&s;e by; where it is believed in that Country that St. <HI>Paul</HI> lay hid three days, and that <HI>Ananias</HI> went to him there.

<P>We then returned into the <HI>Bazar</HI> of Stuffs, or the <HI>Streight-&s;treet,</HI> and on the left hand from thence, we came near to a Gate, which &s;eparates that <HI>Ba|zar</HI> of Stuffs, from another <HI>Bazar</HI> at the end of it, where there is a Fountain, with the Water whereof, (they &s;ay,) <HI>Ananias</HI> bapti&s;ed St. <HI>Paul:</HI> Having pa&s;&s;ed that Gate, we entered into another <HI>Bazar,</HI> which is &s;till in the <HI>Streight-&s;treet,</HI> the beginning of which is covered with a high-ridged Roof, and the re&s;t with a flat, &s;upported with round Joy&s;ts: They &s;ell &s;tuffs there al&s;o.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Bab-Jabie.</HI> The end of the &s;treight-Street.</NOTE> At length we came to the City-Gate called <HI>Bab-Jabie</HI> where the &s;treight-&s;treet ends.</P>
<P>Having without it, turned a few &s;teps to the left hand, we were got into a large <HI>Bazar,</HI> where they &s;ell wooden Boxes.

<P>As you enter into that <HI>Bazar</HI> without the Gate, you &s;ee the green Mo&s;que,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The green Mo&s;que.</NOTE> &s;o called becau&s;e it hath a Steeple faced with green glazed Bricks, which ren|ders it very re&s;plendant; it is covered on the Top with a Pavillion of the &s;ame &s;tuff, except the Spire of the Steeple which is covered with lead. We pa&s;&s;ed before the door of that Mo&s;que, and I &s;aw during the &s;hort time that I dur&s;t con&s;ider it, a large Court, paved with lovely Stones, with a Ba&s;on or Fountain of Water in the middle; at the end of that Court there is a Portico &s;upported by eight Marble-Pillars of the <HI>Corinthian</HI> Order, of which the &s;ix middlemo&s;t are chamfered; the&s;e Eight Pillars uphold &s;o many little domes leaded over, that cover the Portico, through which they enter into the Mo&s;que by three doors.

<P><PB N="16" REF="175">The <HI>Turks</HI> &s;ay that this Mo&s;que was made in that place, becau&s;e that Maho|met being come &s;o far, would not enter the Town, &s;aying it was too delicious; and that he might &s;uddenly remove from it, he &s;et one foot upon a hill that is not far from it, whereon there is a little Tower, and from thence made but one leap to <HI>Mecha;</HI> that's the rea&s;on why they have covered that Mo&s;que with green, which is the Colour of this fal&s;e Prophet. Others confe&s;s indeed, that Mahomet came as far as that place, and would not enter the Town, but they &s;ay that it was <HI>Haly</HI> who made that fair leap: However it be, they call <HI>Dama&s;|cus Cham&s;cherif,</HI> that is to &s;ay Noble <HI>Dama&s;cus,</HI> becau&s;e <HI>Mahomet</HI> came thither.</P>
<P>From thence we advanced to the City-Walls, and coming along the <HI>Serra|glio</HI> Street; we &s;aw to the left hand a fair Tomb made in fa&s;hion of a Dome, &s;everal fathom high, and covered with lead, next to that there is a lovely Mo&s;que with a Court; it fronts the North, and at the end of the Court, there is a <HI>Portico</HI> &s;upported by &s;ix Pillars, by which they enter into the Mo&s;que, which is covered with a very large Dome,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Mo&s;que of <HI>Ha&s;an.</HI></NOTE> having one le&s;s on each &s;ide; they are all three covered with lead: Its Founder was a <HI>Ba&s;ha</HI> called <HI>Ha|&s;an,</HI> who at his death left money to build that Mo&s;que, and his own Tomb.</P>

We entered the Town, and went along by the Ca&s;tle, which was on our left hand, the Ditch wherein there is Water being betwixt us: That Ca&s;tle &s;erves for a Wall to the Town on that &s;ide, and it reaches almo&s;t to the Gate of <HI>Paboutches;</HI> it is a large &s;quare well built fabrick of Free-&s;tone Table cut; the Walls of it are very high, and at certain di&s;tances there are large high &s;quare Towers, built as the re&s;t are, and very near one another. Having walk|ed all along that &s;ide, we went along the &s;econd &s;ide, which &s;erves al&s;o for a Wall to the Town: There we &s;aw a &s;tone-Chain made of a &s;ingle Stone, though it con&s;i&s;ts of &s;everal Links cut one within another; it is fa&s;tened very high to the Wall: There was another Chain longer than this, but &s;ix years agoe it was broken down by foul Weather, and fell into the Ditch.</P>
<P>From thence we pa&s;&s;ed by the Gate of the Ca&s;tle, where we &s;aw &s;ome Cannon that defend the entry of it; then we went to the Market-place of <HI>Paboutches,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Two Mo&s;ques, formerly Churches.</NOTE> and having cro&s;&s;ed it, we went through little Streets to one where there are two Mo&s;ques, in which are the Sepulchres of &s;ome Kings of <HI>Da|ma&s;cus,</HI> having been formerly the Churches of the Chri&s;tians. There is no &s;eeing into one of them; but we looked into the other through lovely Grates of well poli&s;hed Steel. This Mo&s;que is compleatly round, and covered with a lovely Dome of Free-&s;tone, in which there are &s;everal Windows all round; it is faced in the in&s;ide with Marble of various Colours, from the Pavement to the height of three fathome or thereabouts; and from thence up to the Win|dows there are &s;everal fair Paints of Churches and Trees after the Mo&s;aick way. In the middle of the Mo&s;que there are two Tombs one by another, upon a Floor of Marble rai&s;ed about a Foot and a half high: The&s;e Tombs are of Cedar-wood very well wrought; they are about four or five Foot high, and ridged. They &s;ay that the one contains the Body of King <HI>Daer,</HI> who being a Chri&s;tian turned <HI>Turk,</HI> and per&s;ecuted the Chri&s;tians cruelly; and the <HI>Turks</HI> affirm that no Candle nor Lamp can be kept lighted there; it is certain that both times I pa&s;t that way, I &s;aw none. Near to the&s;e Tombs there are &s;ome <HI>Alcorans</HI> chained to desks of the &s;ame matter the Tombs are of, and though all the times I pa&s;&s;ed that way, I &s;aw no body at them, yet I imagine there are men hired to read the <HI>Alcoran</HI> for the Souls of the&s;e Kings; according to the Cu&s;tome of the great Lords of the <HI>Mahometan</HI> Religion, who commonly at their death leave great E&s;tates for performing &s;uch Prayers.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The great Mo&s;que of <HI>Dama&s;cus.</HI></NOTE>Having con&s;idered this Mo&s;que as much as we could, we came to another which is called the great Mo&s;que. I took &s;everal turns about it to &s;ee it by the doors which were open; for a Chri&s;tian dares not &s;et foot within it, nor &s;tand at the door neither. Some <HI>Turks</HI> offered indeed, to take me in with a <HI>Turki&s;h Turban</HI> on my head, but I would not embrace that offer; for had I
<PB N="17" REF="175">
been known I mu&s;t have died, &s;ince, by God's A&s;&s;i&s;tance, I would not re|nounce my Faith. On the We&s;t-&s;ide they enter that Mo&s;que by two great brazen Gates, near four fathom high, which are very well wrought, and full of odd Figures; in the middle of each of them there is a Chalice well cut. By the doors I &s;aw the breadth of that Mo&s;que, which may be a|bout eighteen fathom; it hath two ranges of large thick Pillars of grey Mar|ble, of the Corinthian Order, which divide it into three I&s;les; and of all the&s;e Pillars each two &s;upport an Arch, over which are two little Arches, &s;e|parated by &s;mall Pillars, which look much like Windows: The Pavement is all of lovely &s;tones that &s;hine like Lookingla&s;s. That great Mo&s;que which reaches from Ea&s;t to We&s;t, is covered with a &s;harp ridged wooden Roof, and hath a very large Dome in the middle; but on the Noth-&s;ide, at the place where that Dome is large&s;t, there are little arched Windows all round; and from the&s;e Windows three or four foot higher, which is al&s;o their height, it is faced with green Stone glazed, which makes a lovely object to the &s;ight, and the re&s;t is rough ca&s;t with Lime.</P>
<P>On each &s;ide of the Front of the Mo&s;que, there is a &s;quare Steeple, with Windows like to ours; but the higher and larger is on the Ea&s;t-&s;ide; and they &s;ay it was made when that Church was fir&s;t built, which &s;ince hath been converted into a Mo&s;que. The <HI>Turks</HI> affirm that <HI>Je&s;us</HI> is to return into this World by that Steeple. There is a third Steeple behind the Dome,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Steeple of the <HI>Me&s;&s;ias.</HI></NOTE> which is diametrically oppo&s;ite to that of the <HI>Me&s;&s;ias,</HI> and this la&s;t is round, and hath been built by the <HI>Turks,</HI> a&s;well as the other le&s;s &s;quare one. One Night of the <HI>Ramadan;</HI> I went upon the Terra&s;s-walks, to the Windows of that Mo&s;que, which are made like the Windows of our Churches, and have panes of gla&s;s &s;et in Plai&s;ter which are wrought into Figures. I looked in through a quarry of one of the&s;e Windows, from whence I &s;aw the end of the Mo&s;que, which I could not through the others, becau&s;e on the out&s;ide they have wire Lettices.

<P>Be&s;ides the two ranges of Pillars which are in the Body of the Mo&s;que to the Number of &s;ix and thirty, eighteen to each rank, there are at lea&s;t three|&s;core more, a&s;well in the Court as at the <HI>Portico's</HI> which make the Entrys into the Court.

<P>On the We&s;t-&s;ide there are three Brazen Gates embeli&s;hed with &s;everal Works; and before the&s;e Gates within the Court, there is a <HI>Portico</HI> divided into two Alleys, by eight great Pillars, of which four are in length and four in breadth; and the&s;e Pillars &s;upport Arches, over which there are two o|ther little Arches, made in form of Windows &s;eparated by a little Pillar. That <HI>Portico</HI> leads into the Court, which is very &s;pacious and large, and all paved with great &s;hining Marble-&s;tones, as the Mo&s;que and <HI>Portico's</HI> are. To|wards the end of the Court there is a kind of a little Chappel, with a Dome covered with lead, which is &s;upported by &s;everal Marble-Pillars, and they &s;ay it was the Font.

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. V.</HI> A Continuation of Ob&s;ervations at <HI>Dama&s;cus.</HI></HEAD>
<P>HAving taken a re&s;olution, whil&s;t I was at <HI>Dama&s;cus,</HI> to &s;ee what was mo&s;t curious and worth the &s;eeing in the Countrey about it; I made an appointment with &s;ome Friends to go to the place which is called the <HI>Forty Martyrs.</HI> We went out of the City by the <HI>Serraglio</HI> gate,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The forty Martyrs.</NOTE> and cro&s;&s;ing the hor&s;e-Market, kept our way along, a fair, broad and long paved Street, which does not a little re&s;emble the Avenue of the <HI>Porta di Popolo</HI> at <HI>Rome:</HI> It led us almo&s;t to the Village called <HI>Salain Crache:</HI> Having pa&s;&s;ed this we went up a very rough and barren Hill, being nothing but a natural Rock. It behoved us to alight from our A&s;&s;es and march on foot, a&s;cending by ways &s;o &s;teep that they were almo&s;t perpendicular. With much trouble, at length we came to the place of the forty Martyrs, di&s;tant from the City a good half-League; I never in my life-time mounted a &s;teeper Hill. There is a little hou&s;e on it, where a <HI>Scheik</HI> liveth, who led us into a Grotto hollowed in the Rock; where he &s;hewed us a place, where it is &s;aid <HI>Elias</HI> fa&s;ted &s;ometimes,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Elias</HI>'s Grotto.</NOTE> and was fed by a Raven. In a hole hard by, he &s;hewed us the place where the People of the Countrey &s;ay the forty Martyrs are buried; but no Tomb, Bones, nor A&s;hes are to be &s;een there. He &s;hewed us be&s;ides in the Roof of that Grott, (which is a natural Rock, very hard, and like to Pit-coal, from which much water drops,) the figure of a hand, which they &s;ay is the hand of <HI>Elias,</HI> but which is indeed, no more but the Veines of the Rock, which repre&s;ent (but very imperfectly) long and great fingers, to the number of more than five or &s;ix; and I cannot tell if ever <HI>Elias</HI> was there. As to the forty Martyrs, this is the Story they tell of them. A Jewi&s;h Child having &s;ecretly left his Excre|ments in a Mo&s;que; the King or <HI>Ba&s;ha</HI> being informed next Morning that &s;uch a Packet had been found there, was highly enraged, and cau&s;ed enquiry to be made after the Authour. The Jew who was an Enemy to the Chri|&s;tians, told him that he knew for a certain that they had done it in contempt of his Religion; whereupon he cau&s;ed them all to be put into pri&s;on, and &s;ome time after forty of them, out of a charitable Zeal to &s;ave the re&s;t, con|fe&s;&s;ed them&s;elves guilty of the pretended Crime; upon which he cau&s;ed all the forty to be put to death, though he knew very well they could not all have been guilty. Upon the &s;ame hill, (but at &s;ome hundreds of paces from thence,) is the place of the &s;even Sleepers,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Seven &s;leepers.</NOTE> as the People of the Countrey think. There they &s;hew a Grotto where there are &s;even holes &s;topt; nay &s;ome &s;ay that they &s;leep there &s;till; but in relating the&s;e things they confound &s;o many Hi&s;tories, that it is very hard to know the truth of what they believe: We came back to the Town by the Gate of <HI>Paboutches.</HI></P>
<P>To have a full view of <HI>Dama&s;cus,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The place for having a full view of <HI>Da|ma&s;cus.</HI></NOTE> one mu&s;t go to that place of the forty Martyrs.

<P>This City is in the middle of a &s;pacious Plain on all hands &s;urrounded with Hills, but all di&s;tant from the Town almo&s;t out of &s;ight; tho&s;e on the North-&s;ide (is where that of the forty Martyrs,) are the neare&s;t. On the North-&s;ide it hath a great many Gardens full of Trees, and mo&s;t Fruit-trees; the&s;e Gardens take up the ground from the Hill of the forty Martyrs even to the Town; &s;o that at a di&s;tance it &s;eems to be a Fore&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="177">Another day I went by the <HI>Ba&s;has Serraglio,</HI> and having advanced a little North-wards, in the fir&s;t &s;treet to rhe left hand, I found a Mo&s;que which had formerly been a Church dedicated to St. <HI>Nicholas:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Church of St. <HI>Nicholas</HI> now a Mo&s;que.</NOTE> I entered it, and found it to have been a very large and &s;tately Church, with a &s;pacious Court, environed by a Cloy&s;ter, whereof the Arches are &s;upported by many great marble-Pillars. All that Cloy&s;ter and Court, which is &s;till paved with large fair Stones belonged to the Church, with a great &s;pace enclo&s;ed and covered, which they have changed into a mo&s;que; and they have demoli&s;hed all the Vaults which covered that which I call the Court, and brought into it one of the Rivers of <HI>Dama&s;cus</HI> called <HI>Banias</HI> that runs through the length of it. there they load the Camels that are to go to <HI>Mecha</HI> with Water; and for that end alone they have brought the Cour&s;e of the River that way: There are a great many Trees al&s;o in it which render it a very plea&s;ant place.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Dervi|&s;hes.</HI></NOTE>Being come out of that Court I went to the <HI>Dervi&s;hes,</HI> which are a little farther on the &s;ame &s;ide: They are very well lodged, and have &s;everal Gar|dens through which the River <HI>Banias</HI> runs, before it reaches the Church of St. <HI>Nicholas.</HI> The Name of <HI>Dervi&s;h</HI> is made up of two Per&s;ian words, to wit, of <HI>Der,</HI> which &s;ignifies <HI>Door,</HI> and <HI>Vi&s;h</HI> &s;ignifying <HI>Thre&s;hold,</HI> as if one &s;hould &s;ay the thre&s;hold of the door: Their founder took that Name, to intimate that his de&s;ign was that that order &s;hould particularly make profe&s;&s;ion of humility, by comparing them&s;elves to the thre&s;hold of a door that all People tread upon.</P>
<P>Having viewed that hou&s;e I kept on my way, and came to the Green of <HI>Dama&s;cus</HI> that is not far from it. It is a large Field or Gra&s;s-plat which they call the <HI>Meidan,</HI> encompa&s;&s;ed on all hands with Gardens, and the River <HI>Ba|nias</HI> runs through it. About the middle of it there is a little Pillar in the ground,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The place where God made the fir&s;t Man.</NOTE> about four foot high, and they &s;ay that that is the place where God made the fir&s;t Man. It is a very plea&s;ant place, and therefore when any Per&s;on of Quality pa&s;&s;es by <HI>Dama&s;cus</HI> he pitches his Tents there.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The lovely Ho&s;pital of <HI>More&s;tan.</HI></NOTE>When I was come into that field, I turned to the right, and entered into the <HI>More&s;tan,</HI> which is at the middle of one of the &s;ides of that field. I found my &s;elf in a &s;quare Cloy&s;ter, covered with little Domes, &s;upported by mar|ble Pillars, the fir&s;t ba&s;es of which are of Bra&s;s; on the &s;ide I entered at, and ju&s;t oppo&s;ite unto it, there are Chambers for receiving Pilgrims of what&s;oever Religion they be. Every Chamber is covered with a great Dome, and hath its Chimney, two Pre&s;&s;es, and two Windows, to wit one towards the Green, and one on the other &s;ide. The Cloy&s;ter has twice as many Domes as the Chambers have, the &s;ide on the right hand is appointed for Kitchins, where there are many great Kettles, wherein daily, and even during the <HI>Ra|madan,</HI> they boil <HI>Pilau,</HI> and other &s;uch Food, which they di&s;tribute among&s;t all that come of what&s;oever Religion they be. On the &s;ide oppo&s;ite to the Kitchins is the Mo&s;que, and before it a lovely Portico, covered with Domes, as the re&s;t of the Cloy&s;ter is, but they are &s;omewhat higher, and &s;upported by more lofty Pillars. This Mo&s;que is covered with a very great Dome, having a lovely Minaret on each &s;ide, and all the&s;e Domes and Minarets are covered with Lead. Within the Green there is a fair Garden along the &s;ides of the Cloy&s;ter, where many Trees are planted; it is railed with rails of Wood on the four &s;ides of it, which are five or &s;ix foot high; &s;o that it leaves in the mid|dle a large Square paved with fair Free-Stone, wherein there is a Ba&s;on of an oblong Figure, or rather a very large Canal, through which the River <HI>Banias</HI> runs. This Ho&s;pital was built by <HI>Solyman</HI> the &s;econd who took <HI>Rhodes,</HI> for the accommodation of poor Pilgrims of all Religions; and when I was there, there were a great many Per&s;ons who were already come to perform the Pil|grimage of <HI>Mecha.</HI> I went out of that Ho&s;pital by the oppo&s;ite &s;ide to that which I entered it; and on the left hand I &s;aw the Stables where the Pil|grims Hor&s;es are put, if they have any. Pur&s;uing my way I found to the right hand another Cloy&s;ter of the &s;ame Architecture as the former, and which belongs to the &s;ame Ho&s;pital; it is for poor Scholars, and hath al&s;o its Mo&s;que.</P>
<P>Being come out of the <HI>More&s;tan,</HI> and going &s;treight forwards, I went along a &s;treet, where on each &s;ide are little Chambers for poor Pilgrims al&s;o, and
<PB N="21" REF="177">
over head Rooms for the Women Pilgrims. Then I came to a great Hou&s;e, which hath a &s;quare Court, where they make the Bisket for <HI>Mecha;</HI> and there I &s;aw &s;everal hundred Sacks full, though it was as yet three Weeks to the time of their &s;etting out upon the Journey; They made this Provi&s;ion, becau&s;e it is the cu&s;tome, that at <HI>Dama&s;cus</HI> two hundred Camels are loaded with Biskets, and as many with Water at the <HI>Grand Seigniors</HI> expences, to be di&s;tributed in Charity among&s;t the poor Pilgrims on the way.</P>
<P>Keeping on my way I cro&s;&s;ed the Hor&s;e-Market, where &s;tands a great &s;tone, between four and five foot high, about three foot broad, and half a foot thick, wherein &s;ome lines in <HI>Arabick</HI> are cut, but &s;o worn out that they cannot be read but with great difficulty; the meaning of them is that when this &s;tone &s;hall be covered with water, then <HI>Dama&s;cus</HI> will be taken. Never|thele&s;s <HI>Mon&s;ieur de Bermond</HI> who conducted me to the&s;e places, told me that &s;ome years before he had &s;een &s;o great an inundation, that he believed the &s;tone was covered with water; at lea&s;t as far as he could perceive from a high place pretty near, from whence he di&s;covered all that Market-place, and could not &s;ee the &s;tone; near to which many Franci&s;can Friers were here tofore put to death for the faith.</P>
<P>We came in the next place to the bazar of Hor&s;e-&s;addles; it is &s;o called, be|cau&s;e that is the onely Commodity &s;old there; having advanced a little into it, we &s;aw on the left hand the great <HI>Bagnio</HI> which I &s;hall de&s;cribe: then we entered into the City again by the Gate of <HI>Paboutches;</HI> on both &s;ides of that Gate there is a great Flower-de-luce cut in the Stone.<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Flower-de-luce.</NOTE> We pa&s;&s;ed by the Gate called <HI>Bab-Fardis</HI> which was to our left, on our way to <HI>Bab-Salem,</HI> with out which, but clo&s;e by it, is the conjunction of three Rivers; this is an ex|traordinary plea&s;ant place. Keeping &s;till along the &s;ide of the Wall, we ente|red the City again by the Gate called <HI>Bab-Thoma,</HI> and returned to our Lodging.</P>
<P>All the Coffee-hou&s;es of <HI>Dama&s;cus</HI> are fair, and have much water,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Coffee-hou&s;es of <HI>Dama&s;cus.</HI></NOTE> but the faire&s;t of all are in the Suburbs.

That which is near the <HI>Serraglio</HI> Gate and is called the Bridge Coffee-hou&s;e, becau&s;e it is near a Bridge upon the River, is &s;o much the more delicious that the River borders it on one &s;ide, and that there are Trees all along before it, under the &s;hade of which they who are upon the <HI>Ma&s;tabez</HI> of the Coffee-hou&s;e, have a plea&s;ant fre&s;h Air, and the view of the River running below them.

All know what a Coffee-berry is, from which the&s;e places take their denomination; I have &s;poken of it in my former Travels, and &s;hall onely add in this place what I learned of the qualities of that drink, to wit, that being drank very hot, it clears the head of vapours, moderately hot it binds up the body,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Effects of Coffee.</NOTE> and cold it is laxative.</P>
<P>At <HI>Dama&s;cus</HI> there are <HI>Capucins,</HI> and Monks of the holy Land, who&s;e hou&s;es are near to one another in the quarter of the <HI>Maronites,</HI> and ju&s;t o|ver again&s;t their Church, where al&s;o they &s;ay Ma&s;s: becau&s;e each of the&s;e orders have their Chappel there.

<P>I &s;tayed four and twenty days in <HI>Dama&s;cus,</HI> but could have been wil|ling not to have &s;tayed &s;o long becau&s;e of the troubles I was threatned with A fal&s;e report being &s;pread about the Town, by the malice of &s;ome, and per|haps of a Servant whom I had turned away, that I had thirty thou&s;and <HI>Che|quins</HI> with me; all ways were u&s;ed to &s;nap &s;ome of the&s;e pretended <HI>Chequins:</HI>
<PB N="22" REF="178">
and for that end (as I had information) the <HI>Capicoules</HI> or <HI>Jani&s;&s;aries</HI> lay &s;eve|ral times in wait to Arre&s;t me upon &s;ome fal&s;e pretext: nay the &s;ame <HI>Chorbagi</HI> whom I met upon the Rode as I came from <HI>Saide,</HI> having &s;ent for <HI>Mon&s;ieur Bermond</HI> a French Merchant, who was his friend, told him, perhaps to pump him, that I had told him I was his Kin&s;man, but that, in &s;hort, he knew I was a great and rich Lord, and that I &s;hould look to my &s;elf, becau&s;e &s;everal threa|tened me, and that he would &s;erve me, for his &s;ake, if I &s;tood in need of it. This report daily encrea&s;ing and I being very well known by face, the onely remedy I had was to leave <HI>Dama&s;cus:</HI> but &s;eeing there was no opportunity of a Caravan, I could not be delivered by that means, &s;o &s;oon as I could have wi&s;hed, and I was forced to re&s;olve to keep within Doors, or at lea&s;t not to &s;tir abroad but as little as I could, whil&s;t I &s;tayed for the occa&s;ion of &s;ome Ca|ravan; I could not doubt of the danger I was in, e&s;pecially when I knew that they watched the Reverend Father <HI>George</HI> a Je&s;uit, who among&s;t other kindne&s;&s;es he &s;hewed me, took the pains to come and teach me the u&s;e of the A&s;trolabe, which obliged us for the future to corre&s;pond onely by Letters: Notwith&s;tanding all the&s;e cautions my Quality and Pur&s;e augmented daily in the mouths of the people. In the mean time as luck would have it, the night before my departure, I had an expre&s;s from <HI>Mon&s;ieur Bertet</HI> one of the chief Merchants of <HI>Aleppo</HI> upon occa&s;ion of my writing to him, to give me notice when there was a Caravan ready to part for <HI>Bagdad.</HI> In a trice all the Town knew of the coming of this Man, though it was in the night-time, and every one &s;aid, that he was come for all the <HI>Franks;</HI> but next morning the rumour run that it was onely for that <HI>Frank</HI> who was &s;o rich; and a <HI>Turk</HI> told me, that there were &s;ome fools enough, to affirm I was the King of <HI>France</HI> his Brother. Seeing the&s;e honours exceedingly di&s;plea&s;ed me, and that I under|&s;tood there was a Caravan ready to depart; I bargained with a <HI>Moucre</HI> to conduct me to <HI>Aleppo,</HI> to carry my Bagage and pay the <HI>Caffares:</HI> we agreed for thirteen <HI>Boquelles</HI> which was very cheap; and we were to be gone with the Caravan that carried the <HI>Hazna</HI> of the powder of <HI>Caire</HI> to <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> of which there was an hundred and fifty load, of three&s;core and ten or four|&s;core <HI>Oques</HI> a piece, carried on Camels and Mules: That Caravan was com|manded by an <HI>Aga,</HI> and was to be guarded by fifty or three&s;core Troopers; &s;o that being informed that it would con&s;i&s;t of at lea&s;t, two hundred Men, Ma&s;ters and Servants, I was very glad I had the fortune to meet with it.</P>
<P>Having ordered my bagage to be loaded, I went to take my leave of fa|ther <HI>George,</HI> and as I came out of his hou&s;e, I perceived all the Terra&s;&s;es full of Women gathered together to &s;ee me as I pa&s;&s;ed; then I went to wait on the Seignior <HI>Michael Topgi</HI> to thank him for all the Civilities he had &s;hewn me at <HI>Dama&s;cus,</HI> and to bid him fare well: That gallant man would needs con|tinue me his favour to the la&s;t, and gave me two Letters one in Arabick and and the other in Turki&s;h, in form of a Pa&s;s-port, to all the Lords and Gover|nours from <HI>Dama&s;cus</HI> to <HI>Bagdad:</HI> In the&s;e Letters he &s;aid I was his Brother, and called me <HI>Francis the Gunner;</HI> I cannot tell if I could have an&s;wered that Character if an occa&s;ion had offered. And being afraid they might &s;top me or offer me &s;ome affront, he obliged me to take hor&s;e at his Gate, though I pray|ed him to let me walk on foot, becau&s;e Chri&s;tians dare not ride through the Town on hor&s;e-back; but he would have it &s;o, and gave me two hor&s;e-men to &s;erve me for a guard, commanding them to pa&s;s through the City the one before and the other behind me, and &s;o to convey me &s;afe to my fir&s;t Nights Lodging, which they very civilly performed.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Womens Mourning.</NOTE>It is a pretty ridiculous thing too, to &s;ee the Mourning which the Women at <HI>Dama&s;cus</HI> appear in, at the death of their relations, and even the Chri&s;tian women. I had that diver&s;ion one Evening about eight a Clock at Night when I was at the <HI>Capucins</HI> gate. I perceived &s;everal <HI>Maronite</HI> women returning from the lodging of one of their relations, who died three hours before; there was above twenty of them, and they made a great deal of noi&s;e, &s;ome &s;inging, and others crying, knocking their brea&s;ts with their hands joined together, and two Men carried each a Candle to light them. When they were over again&s;t the <HI>Maronites</HI> Church, which is before the hou&s;e of the <HI>Capucins,</HI> they &s;topt, and put them&s;elves in a ring, where for a long time they &s;napt the fingers of the right hand, as if they had been Ca&s;tanets, a|gain&s;t one anothers No&s;es, keeping time to the &s;ongs they &s;ung, as if they rejoyced, whil&s;t &s;ome of them from time to time howled and cried like mad Women: At length having performed that Mu&s;ick a pretty long while, they made many bows to the Ea&s;t lifting up the right hand to their head, and then &s;tooping it down to the ground; having done &s;o they marched fore|ward, with the &s;ame Mu&s;ick as before.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The way of thre&s;hing Corn.</NOTE>At <HI>Dama&s;cus</HI> and almo&s;t all <HI>Turkey</HI> over, they thre&s;h not the Corn; but after it is cut down, they put it up in heaps, and round the heap, they &s;pread &s;ome of it four or five foot broad, and two foot thick: This being done they have a kind of &s;led made of four pieces of Timber in &s;quare; two of which &s;erve for an Axle-tree to two great rowlers, who&s;e ends enter into the&s;e two pieces of Timber, &s;o as that they ea&s;ily turn in them; round each of the&s;e rowlers there are three Iron-pinions about half a foot thick, and a foot in diametre; the&s;e pinions are full of teeth like &s;o many &s;aws; there is a &s;eat placed upon the two chief pieces of Timber, where a man &s;its, and drives the hor&s;es that draw this Machine round upon the lay of Corn that is two foot thick, and that cutting the &s;traw very &s;mall makes the Corn come out of the ear without breaking it, for it &s;lides betwixt the teeth of the Iron. When the &s;traw is well cut, they put in more, and then &s;epa|rate the Corn from that ha&s;hed Straw, by to&s;&s;ing all up together in the Air with a wooden &s;hovel; for the Wind blows the Straw a little a&s;ide, and the Corn alone falls &s;treight down:<NOTE PLACE="marg">The way of feeding Hor|&s;es.</NOTE> They feed their Hor&s;es with that cut Straw. In &s;ome places, that Machine is different, as I have &s;een in <HI>Me&s;opo|tamia;</HI> where in &s;tead of the&s;e pinions round the rowler, they have many pegs of Iron about &s;ix Inches long, and three broad, almo&s;t in the &s;hape of wedges, but &s;omewhat broader below than above, fa&s;tened without any order into the rowlers; &s;ome &s;treight and others cro&s;s ways; and this Engine is covered with Boards over the Irons, whereon he that drives the Hor&s;es &s;its, for he has no other &s;eat to &s;it upon, they take the &s;ame cour&s;e in <HI>Per&s;ia;</HI> neverthele&s;s in &s;ome places they cut not the Straw, but onely make Oxen or Hor&s;es tread out the Corn with their feet, which they &s;eparate from the Straw as I have &s;aid.</P>
<P>Of all the Corn which they prepare in this manner, Barley is the oneiy grain they feed their Hor&s;es with: In the Morning they give every Hor&s;e an <HI>Ocque</HI> of that Barley, and four at Night which they mingle with cut Straw,

and that's all they have the whole day. In <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> the Hor&s;es have Barley onely at Night, but in the Day-time they give them a Sack of Straw.</P>
<P>Let us now &s;ee how they make Butter at <HI>Dama&s;cus,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The way of making But|ter.</NOTE> which is the &s;ame way all <HI>Turkey</HI> over.

When they would have this <HI>Yogourt</HI> more delicious, they heat the Milk, and put a &s;poonfull of &s;ower Milk to it, which they make &s;ower with runnet; and by that mixture all the Milk becoming <HI>Yogourt,</HI> they let it cool and then u&s;e it; or if they have a mind to keep it, they put it with Salt into a bag which they tye very fa&s;t, that what is within may be pre&s;&s;ed; and let it drop until no more come out: Of that matter there remains no more in the bag but a kind of a Butter or rather white Chee&s;e, of which when they have a mind to have <HI>Yogourt</HI> they take a morcel, and &s;teep it in water, which they drink with great plea&s;ure; they u&s;e much of it to refre&s;h them&s;elves, e&s;pecially in the Caravans, where they have always good &s;tore. This <HI>Yogourt</HI> is very &s;harp, but e&s;pecially that which remains after they have made the Butter.</P>

<P><HI>MOnday</HI> Morning the one and twentieth of <HI>April,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Departure from <HI>Dama&s;|cus.</HI></NOTE> I parted from <HI>Dama&s;|cus,</HI> with the two Hor&s;e-men of the <HI>Topgi</HI> in the manner I mentioned before. We went out at the Gate called <HI>Bab-Thoma,</HI> and keeping &s;treight E&acirc;&s;t, in three hours time came to <HI>E&s;&s;air,</HI> a &s;mall Village,<NOTE PLACE="marg">E&s;&s;air.</NOTE> by which runs a little River, that divides into two, above the Village: There is a <HI>Han</HI> there that has two Courts, and there we found all the Caravan which was to con|vey the powder; with whom my <HI>Moucre</HI> and I encamped. Next Morning a|bout half an hour after five they decamped, and we marched Ea&s;tward, in a &s;pacious plain, though near us to the left we had Mountains of white Rocks: About eight a Clock we began to have hills on both hands, with barren plains betwixt them; and three hours after, that's to &s;ay, about eleven a Clock we arrived at <HI>Cteifa,</HI> above which we encamped, over again&s;t the <HI>Han.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Cteifa. <HI>The</HI> Han <HI>of</HI> Cteifa.</NOTE></P>
<P><HI>Cteifa</HI> is a large Village, near to which there is a great <HI>Han</HI> with high Walls of Free-&s;tone, well built with Battlements; it hath a great Gate to the South, another to the North, and two little ones on the &s;ides. The South Gate begins a long Entry arched over, on the &s;ides whereof there are &s;hops, furni&s;hed with all things that can be nece&s;&s;ary for a Caravan, and a Coffee-hou&s;e and Bagnio. Afterwards you enter into a large &s;quare Court, which hath all round it <HI>Ma&s;tabez,</HI> or &s;tone half paces for lodging the Caravan. This Court hath great Gates in the in&s;ide, one at each front, of which the Ea&s;t and South are faced with Iron. When you are entered the Court, the door which you find leads you to the Mo&s;que, which hath a fair Dome rough ca&s;t over, and a goodly Minaret: Coming out of the Mo&s;que through the Court, by the Ea&s;t-gate, you enter fir&s;t into a vaulted walk, which hath <HI>Ma&s;|tabez,</HI> on each &s;ide, from thence into, another Court &s;omewhat longer than broad, which is well paved; in the middle whereof there is a great &s;quare
<PB N="26" REF="180">
re&s;ervatory for Water, built of Free-&s;tone, that &s;erves for watering the Bea&s;ts: That water runs from a little Conduit, which keeps always the Ba&s;on full, and I believe it comes from a Brook, that runs behind the <HI>Han,</HI> on the Ea&s;t-&s;ide, almo&s;t by the root of the Walls. In this Court there are Lodging-rooms under a vaulted Gallery that runs all round it, and is &s;upported on each &s;ide in length, by eleven Arches, and by nine in breadth. Behind that Gal|lery there is a kind of vaulted Stable, which ranges likewi&s;e round the Court, and that Court has its <HI>Ma&s;tabez</HI> to &s;eparate the Men from the Bea&s;ts; the&s;e <HI>Ma&s;tabez</HI> are divided into &s;everal appartments, every one having its Chim|ney, and the Entry to it is by a gate in the middle of each &s;ide. This whole Fabrick is of Free-&s;tone, and well endowed, being founded by a <HI>Vizier.</HI> The Ca&s;tle which <HI>Pietro Della Valle</HI> &s;ays is in this Town, with a good Garri&s;on, is not there, and in all probability never was, unle&s;s he meant a large round Tower in the Village, which is ea&s;ily &s;een from the <HI>Han,</HI> and upon the road too; becau&s;e it is much higher than the Walls of the Village, into which I entered not, as not thinking it convenient, be&s;ides that, there is a pretty deal of way from the <HI>Han</HI> to that Village. A Countrey-man told me, that hereto|fore that Town was held by the <HI>Francks,</HI> and that then there was a lovely Church where at pre&s;ent the <HI>Han</HI> &s;tands.</P>
<P>We parted from thence on <HI>Wedne&s;day</HI> the twenty third of <HI>April,</HI> about three long hours before the break of day, and our departure was &s;o &s;ud|den, that &s;o &s;oon as they awakened me, we made ha&s;te and loaded, and followed the Caravan that was upon the march before we began to load. I thought that the Moon not ri&s;ing till a little before day, we &s;hould have put off till day; but we went by Candle-light, I having borrowed a Lan|thorn. All that I could ob&s;erve in the darkne&s;s, was that our way was North-Ea&s;t, and that we were entering in among&s;t Mountains, but with a ve|ry ea&s;ie a&s;cent, they being onely near us on both &s;ides, and were all of pieces of &s;harp pointed Rocks. We went al&s;o along the &s;ide of a precipice, but that la&s;ted not long. A little after we pa&s;t by a kind of a <HI>Han,</HI> that &s;tood alone by it &s;elf: I &s;uffered much cold that Night, though I had on my Capot, for the Wind that blew pierced through every thing. When it began to be day, I perceived the more we advanced the more di&s;tant were the Hills from us on both &s;ides, and &s;till le&s;&s;ening in height. By day we were got into a great Plain covered with heath and <HI>Abrotonum foemina,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Abrotonum faemina.</NOTE> of which there is a great deal on the way from <HI>Dama&s;cus</HI> to <HI>Aleppo,</HI> but it is very low. We continu|ed our march in that plain as far as <HI>Nebk,</HI> where commonly they pay ten <HI>Pia&s;tres</HI> a Mule; we pa&s;t by a Village before where there is a <HI>Han.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Nebk.</NOTE>About Noon we arrived at <HI>Nebk,</HI> which is a pretty good Village built upon a Height, and watered by a River that runs underneath it; upon which there is a little Bridge of three Arches, and by it we encamped: There is a <HI>Han</HI> made there &s;ince, which at that time they were fini&s;hing. It is all of Free-&s;tone, taken out of adjoyning Quarries, which are common in that place, and furni&s;h as much Stone as one can de&s;ire. There are <HI>Greeks</HI> in that Village, and on the &s;ides of the River many Gardens, planted for the mo&s;t part with Vines.</P>
<P>We parted from <HI>Nebk,</HI> on <HI>Thur&s;day</HI> the four and twentieth of <HI>April,</HI> three hours before day; our way lay Northward, and at break of day, we pa&s;&s;ed through <HI>Cara,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Cara.</NOTE> which is a good Town, having a Rivulet running by it. There are a great many ruines to be &s;een there, which are a &s;ign that heretofore it hath been &s;omewhat more con&s;iderable; and indeed, the People of the Countrey &s;ay, that when that place belonged to the Chri&s;tians it was a no|ted Town. There are &s;everal <HI>Greeks</HI> there &s;till, who have a Church beauti|fully painted.

Then for above an hour, we &s;truck off to the North-We&s;t among&s;t little hills; and half an hour after ten, entered into a great Plain where nothing grew but Heath and <HI>Abro|tonum

In the middle of the Court there is a &s;quare Mo&s;que covered with a Dome rough ca&s;t, and clo&s;e by, a little watering place which three little Channels continually fill with fair water that runs pretty near that <HI>Han.</HI> from the &s;econd Court we enter into a place, which, (they &s;ay,) is the Ca&s;tle, built of rough Stone, but it hath no figure of a Ca&s;tle, and is a bare enclo|&s;ure ef low Walls: Neverthele&s;s &s;everal Families for mo&s;t part <HI>Greeks</HI> have their aboad there. About fifty paces from that pretended Ca&s;tle, there is a little Village, not to be &s;een but by chance, as it happened to me when I was walking; for there are about twenty Earthen hou&s;es a fathom high, built in a large &s;quare Ditch, &s;o deep that the Roofs or Terra&s;&s;es of the hou&s;es are two or three fathom lower than the level of the Fields about; &s;o that when one is upon the brink of that Ditch, the hou&s;es &s;eem &s;o low, that at fir&s;t I took it for a Quarry.</P>
<P><HI>Friday</HI> Morning the five and twentieth of <HI>April</HI> we parted from <HI>A&s;&s;ia</HI> three hours before day; at the break of day, we met a Caravan of Mules carrying Pilgrims to <HI>Dama&s;cus,</HI> who were going thither on their way to <HI>Me|cha.</HI> A little after we pa&s;&s;ed by a &s;mall Ca&s;tle called <HI>Chem&s;in.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Chem&s;in.</NOTE></P>

In that Countrey there are al&s;o a great many <HI>Harmolans,</HI> and I &s;aw plenty of them in all the places of <HI>A&s;ia</HI> through which I pa&s;t. Before Noon we arrived at <HI>Hams,</HI> and encamped in a place by the &s;ide of the Town near the Burying-place: The Inhabitants believe that that Town was the Countrey of <HI>Job.</HI> In pa&s;&s;ing I viewed the Ca&s;tle, which is &s;ituated on a little hill of an oval figure, that tapers from the bottom to the top; it is all covered over with herbs, but &s;o &s;teep, that I think there is but one way to get up to it, and that made on purpo&s;e too; upon it &s;tands the Ca&s;tle, which in &s;ome places has great breaches: In tho&s;e quarters all the Ca&s;tles are built on hills. I perceived very well that the Village was long, but that is all I could ob&s;erve; becau&s;e my <HI>Moucre</HI> made me get under the Tent of one of his Friends, to avoid the <HI>Caffare</HI> which was of twenty <HI>Pia&s;|tres,</HI> and would needs al&s;o have me put on a white Turban, before I came to the Town, that &s;o I might pa&s;s for a <HI>Turk;</HI> but I would not do it. In that Plain where we encamped, there are a great many ancient Sepulchres, in form of a Pyramide; and among&s;t others I &s;aw one, which I judged to be that, on which <HI>Belo</HI> and <HI>Pietro della Valle</HI> ob&s;erved an in&s;cription; but &s;eeing the Sun was &s;et before I went thither, I can &s;ay nothing as to that.

<P>We parted from <HI>Hams,</HI> on <HI>Saturday</HI> the twenty &s;ixth of <HI>April,</HI> a little while after mid-night, and marched &s;till Northwards, and through the &s;ame Plain we had the day before.

Some hundreds of paces from thence we found a fair &s;tone-Bridge, paved with large Stones: In going thither we pa&s;t by the Gate of a <HI>Han,</HI> which reaches along the River's &s;ide; at each Corner it is flanked with a round Tower, and in the middle of it there is a Mo&s;que covered with a Dome rough ca&s;t over. Then we cro&s;&s;ed the Bridge which they call <HI>Dge|&s;er

Re&s;tan,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Dge&s;er Re&s;tan.</NOTE> that is to &s;ay, the Bridge of <HI>Re&s;tan.</HI> I thought that Bridge had taken its Name from the Village; but I was told that the River al&s;o was cal|led <HI>Re&s;tan,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">A&s;i.</NOTE> though its common Name be <HI>A&s;i,</HI> that's to &s;ay, rebell, becau&s;e, &s;aid one of the Caravan to me, it is a very rapid River; and e&s;pecially at that place. This Bridge hath ten Arches &s;omewhat more than a fathom broad,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Orontes.</NOTE> and a little higher, and it is the <HI>Orontes</HI> of the Ancients that runs under it. Before it reach the Bridge it makes two little I&s;les, like to very plea|&s;ant Gardens. Over again&s;t the middle of the Bridge, towards a <HI>Han</HI> there is a great &s;quare pile of building in the Water; through which the Water pa&s;&s;ing, makes on the other &s;ide lovely ca&s;cades or falls; &s;o that there &s;eems to be &s;ome mill within; but I heard no noi&s;e of any. At that place the Ri|ver is as broad as the Bridge is long, but then its Channel is &s;treightened to &s;ix or &s;even fathom over, as before, and in &s;ome places to le&s;s, making many turnings among&s;t the hills where it runs, but the Water of it is thick and muddy. Having cro&s;&s;ed that Bridge, we left the River, taking our way Northward, and &s;aw many good Corn-fields: Two hours after we di&s;cove|red <HI>Hama,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Hama.</NOTE> where we arrived after Noon.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Han Scheik|houn.</NOTE>A little after towards Noon we arrived at <HI>Han Scheikhoun,</HI> before which we encamped; finding our &s;elves better abroad under Tents than within, though that <HI>Han</HI> which &s;tands alone, be pretty enough. The fir&s;t entry into it, is by a Gate that looks to the We&s;t, which leads into a large &s;quare Court, and on the right hand as you enter, there is a little door by which you enter into a Stable, divided in length by a range of Arches that reach from one end to the other, but it is not covered: At the other end of the Court, almo&s;t oppo&s;ite to this door, there is a little hou&s;e inhabited; and on the left hand in the middle of the Wall, there is a great Gate, which leads into another Court, as large as the fir&s;t, where there are half paces covered for Lodging of Travellers. Over the Gate of that &s;econd Court, there is a great &s;quare Building of pretty good work in form of a Tower with a Dungeon before it, and the Dome of the Mo&s;que is in the middle. There the <HI>Aga</HI> lodges, for this is a Ca&s;tle depending on the <HI>Ba&s;ha</HI> of <HI>Aleppo.</HI> Some hundreds of paces Northwards from thence, behind a Hillock, there is a Village of the &s;ame Name with the <HI>Han.</HI> We parted from that place the &s;ame day about ten a Clock at Night, and in our way all Night long, we found a great many &s;hallow Ci&s;terns, dug on little Hillocks, for receiving the Rain-water, and at the foot of the Hillock, there is another opening, by which

<P>Next day being <HI>Monday</HI> the 28th. of <HI>April,</HI> about two in the morning, we pa&s;&s;ed by a ruinated <HI>Han,</HI> called <HI>Han Hherte,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Han Hherte.</NOTE> and at break of day arrived at the Town of <HI>Marra,</HI> encamping ju&s;t before the <HI>Han.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Marra.</NOTE> That Town is at mo&s;t but a good Village; we could hardly find bread in it, and there is nothing to be &s;een on all hands but Cellars and ruined Vaults: the be&s;t thing is the <HI>Han,</HI> which is well built of Free-&s;tone: it is a large &s;quare Court, round which there is a <HI>Portico,</HI> wherein are <HI>Ma&s;tabez;</HI> &s;eeing I often make u&s;e of that Term, which is the proper word of the Countrey&punc; though I have already, I think, made known what it means, neverthele&s;s for the &s;atisfaction of the Reader, I tell him once more; that a <HI>Ma&s;tabe</HI> is a kind of a half pace, that's to &s;ay, that the Floor is rai&s;ed two or three foot from the ground, and there the Travellers lodge. In the middle of the Court of this <HI>Han,</HI> there is a little Mo&s;que, with a Dome covered with Lead; at the end of it there is a little Court, round which runs a <HI>Portico,</HI> the Roof whereof is &s;upported on each &s;ide by two Arches &s;eparated by a Pillar between the two: clo&s;e by, there is a <HI>Bagnio,</HI> with a large Dome covered with Lead, but it is &s;hut and u&s;ele&s;s for want of Water: Next you'l find a covered &s;treet, where there is a Coffee-hou&s;e, and five or &s;ix Shops on each &s;ide; and at the farther end are four Ar|ches, the remains of an Aqueduct which butted almo&s;t in a right Angle upon the&s;e four Arches; it was carried thither from a Mo&s;que &s;ome hundreds of pa|ces di&s;tant in the fields, where there was a Wheel to draw Water out of a Brook that ran by it, which came from the Countrey towards <HI>Antioch.</HI> This Aqueduct brought the Water behind the upper part of the covered &s;treet, in|to the <HI>Bagnio</HI> that is joyned on the one &s;ide to the Street, and on the other &s;ide to the <HI>Han;</HI> it was built of rough Stone, as the Arches that &s;till remain are, which at the other end are joyned to the great Mo&s;que. This great Mo&s;que hath &s;ix little Domes, the Roofs rough ca&s;t, and at the end of it there is a pretty fair Minaret. The re&s;t of the Town is altogether beggar|ly: It had al&s;o another <HI>Han,</HI> of which nothing now remains but the Gate, and &s;ome Arches which daily run into decay. The hou&s;es are &s;cattered here and there, and no better than Owls-ne&s;ts; the Walls are of Stones two or three foot high, piled one upon another without any Art; on all hands there are great large Free-&s;tones, and pieces of Pillars to be &s;een, &s;ome of which &s;till retain &s;ome fragments of in&s;criptions. Among&s;t the&s;e Ruines, I &s;aw a door about four foot high, and half a foot thick, with cro&s;&s;es and ro&s;es cut upon it; it is all of one piece with its hooks, which enter into holes purpo&s;ely made above and below: That door is of a greyi&s;h Stone, very hard, as the &s;ides to which it &s;huts are, and it requires no le&s;s than two men to open and &s;hut it; it is &s;till in ca&s;e and daily made u&s;e of. <HI>Marra</HI> heretofore was a good Town, but the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Tyranny is the cau&s;e of its de&s;olation; they &s;ay that the Ruines of a Church built by the Chri&s;tians, when they were Ma&s;ters of that Town, are &s;till to be &s;een there; but becau&s;e it is at &s;ome di&s;tance in the Countrey, I did not go thither.

<P>At <HI>Aleppo</HI> when the Grapes are ripe, they bring them to the Town,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Grapes.</NOTE> in Sacks of Goats hair, without breaking, though &s;ometimes they be brought eight French Leagues from that City. The&s;e Grapes have a very thick Skin, are all white, and make a very &s;trong Wine, the be&s;t time to gather them is in the Month of <HI>May.</HI> All buy as many as they &s;tand in need of for making of Wine; for it is the Cu&s;tom of the Inhabitants of <HI>Aleppo,</HI> that every one makes his own Wine in his own hou&s;e after this manner.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The way of making Wine at <HI>Aleppo.</HI></NOTE> They put the Grapes into a great &s;quare fat of wood, where they pre&s;s them with mens feet; and then the Wine runs into a Pale or a &s;hallow Tub through a hole and &s;trainer at the bottom of the fat: When it is all run out, they put it with the Lees into very large Earthen Jarrs, where it works for thirty or forty Days; the&s;e Jarrs are covered onely with a Board and a Cloath over it, without any fear of its taking vent.</P>
<P>In this manner they leave it as long as they plea&s;e, nay &s;ometimes a whole Year, carefully &s;tirring it every day: And when they have a mind to drink it they draw it off, provided the time, at lea&s;t wherein it was to work, be o|ver, and they put it with the lees again into the fat, where they &s;train it a &s;econd time: When it runs no more, they put the lees into a bag, and pre&s;s them in the &s;ame pre&s;s with mens Feet, till no more come out, and what comes out runs into the re&s;t: Then they &s;pread the Stalks of the Grapes that have been &s;o pre&s;t in the fat, and pour upon them all the Wine again, and &s;o let it run through a third time: This being done it is clear, fit for drinking and hath no lees. They then barrel it up, and in that manner make Wine at <HI>Aleppo</HI> all the months of the year; but as I have already &s;aid, it is onely White-wine; for there are no red nor black Grapes in all tho&s;e Quarters. The Chri&s;tians in that City make very good Brandy; but they who &s;ell it, are obliged to put about &s;ix Drachms of Alum into a Bucket full of Brandy to make it &s;tronger, for otherwi&s;e the <HI>Turks</HI> would not like it.</P>
<P>They drink very good Water at <HI>Aleppo,</HI> ob&s;erving a great deal of circum|&s;pection in the u&s;e of it. It is indeed River-water, but it is diverted from the River about three Leagues above <HI>Aleppo,</HI> near a place called <HI>Ailan</HI> from whence it is brought into the City in open Aqueducts, which coming near the Town, are conveyed under ground to Fountains whence they take the Water: The&s;e Aqueducts have been made for purifying the Water, which is very muddy, and al&s;o for &s;upplying the City; for the River being low in the Summer-time, the Gardens drain all the Water almo&s;t with their Pou&s;&s;eragues.</P>
<P>The <HI>Francks</HI> have Ci&s;terns al&s;o which they fill with the Water of the&s;e Aqueducts, by opening a hole in the Ci&s;tern through which the Water comes, and then &s;topping it again a&s;well as the mouth of the Ci&s;tern, which they open not but in Summer; and the&s;e Ci&s;terns are made not onely to keep the Water very cool, but al&s;o to make it pure and clear. They have be&s;ides another excellent way of clarifying it; that is, they put the Water into great Jarrs of unburnt Clay, through which it di&s;tills, and falls into Ve&s;|&s;els, put underneath to receive it. This River of <HI>Aleppo</HI> comes from <HI>Antab,</HI> two days Journey from thence, and lo&s;es it &s;elf under ground about half a league beyond <HI>Aleppo;</HI> many think that it comes from <HI>Euphrates,</HI> near to which it hides it &s;elf under ground, and appears again at <HI>Antab.</HI></P>

I came to know afterwards in <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> that when they make the <HI>Sagri,</HI> after they have &s;haved the skin, they wet it, and put it upon a little frame of wood, to which they fa&s;ten it by &s;treight cords; then they lay the grain (which perhaps is no more but &s;and) pretty thick all over it, and &s;o expo&s;e it to the Sun; when it is dry, they beat off that &s;and or grain, knocking the back-&s;ide of the skin with a &s;tick, and then they wet it again, and put the grain to it a &s;econd time, which &s;ometimes after they beat off again in the &s;ame manner, and that's the whole my&s;tery.</P>
<P>They drive a pretty good trade at <HI>Aleppo</HI> in <HI>Cabrons</HI> hair (that is the hair under the belly of &s;ome he Goats, which is very fine, and u&s;ed in the making of hats:) I was told that when they are put on board, great care mu&s;t be taken that they be not wet, becau&s;e then they would be in danger of tak|ing fire of them&s;elves in a &s;hort time, like Hay that is brought in before it be dry; and &s;ome Ships have been burnt by that means, though that hap|pen not always infallibly.</P>

They take about an <HI>Oque</HI> of that Excrement, and boil it in water, then they &s;train that water, and put it into the fat, adding afterwards &s;ome of the water of dates. For making of that date-water, there is no more to be done but to put about an <HI>Oque</HI> of Dates into water, and &s;tir them well, rubbing them with the hands in the water, &s;o that all the &s;ub&s;tance of the Dates may be di&s;&s;olved, and nothing remain but the &s;tone; then having pa&s;&s;ed that liquour through a

<P>Four days after they have put in the&s;e waters of Dogs-turd and Date, they add to it about two handfulls of un&s;lacked Lime. The preparation of that dye requires &s;even or eight days, and &s;ometimes a fortnight, during that time they keep a gentle fire of Camels-dung under the Fat, but &s;o weak that it &s;erves onely to keep the dye always warm; they put no urine to it, u&s;ing Dogs-turd in &s;tead of it, which they &s;ay makes the Indigo to &s;tick better to the things that are dyed.</P>

Then pa&s;&s;ed the Bakers, mo&s;t of them all dawbed with Flower, and their portable <HI>Divan</HI> was &s;tuck all round with Ears of Corn; on which a little Boy kneeded Dough in a tray that &s;tood before him. The la&s;t who came that Night were the Taylers, in the &s;ame order the others did; but many of their Company were covered all over with Furs, having al&s;o &s;ticks like fools baubles covered in the &s;ame manner, and their <HI>Divan</HI> (on which was a little Boy a &s;ewing,) was edged all round with Furs.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t Trade that marched the fifth night, was the Dyers,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The proce&s;&s;i|on of the Dyers.</NOTE> which made one of the fine&s;t Shews. After &s;ome little Boys wearing horns on their Heads, came about an hundred men covered with Tygres skins or Coats of Mail; they carried Muskets on their Shoulders, Swords and Targets by their &s;ides, and Wax-tapers in their hands, and roared and danced like Fools; then came three Quires of Mu&s;ick con&s;i&s;ting of the anciente&s;t of the company, who &s;inging with all their force and dancing, at lea&s;t with their heads, &s;aid the <HI>Fatah</HI> for the <HI>Grand Signior</HI> before the great <HI>Khan:</HI> After that appeared the <HI>Divan</HI> carried by &s;ome men, on which were &s;pread &s;everal pieces of &s;tuff dyed red; and in the middle there was a little Boy, who &s;inging as loud as he could, took a white Cloath by the two Corners, and &s;preading it out be|fore all the Spectators, dipt it into a great Pale &s;tanding before him, and im|mediately pulled it out all red; he wrung it, and then &s;pread it abroad. I was &s;urprized at fir&s;t, and &s;o were all the re&s;t, to &s;ee that the Cloath had ta|ken the dye &s;o &s;oon; but I fancy that he left it in the Pale, and pulled out another already dyed, however it was nimbly done: That <HI>Divan</HI> was fol|lowed by another, whereon a Boy knocked blew Stuffs, to make the water come out of them.</P>
<P>To this company &s;ucceeded the Curriers or Turkey Leather-dre&s;&s;ers,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Curriers.</NOTE> who had a great many Youths marching before them attired with Goats horns of &s;everal Colours, four or five foot long; they were followed by &s;everal Chil|dren, all clad in Turkey-leather, and then marched the <HI>Militia,</HI> the Old men and the <HI>Divan,</HI> on which were two little Boys one of which dyed the Lea|ther red, and &s;pread it upon the rails, and the other &s;moothing it with a little Rowling-pin, &s;tretched it out upon a bigger.</P>
<P>After this trade, came the Grocers, or &s;ome &s;uch trade; for they &s;ell Oyl,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Grocers.</NOTE> Olives, Fruit and the like Commodities.

<P>The fourth Company was the Cap-makers both for Men and Women;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cap-makers.</NOTE> the&s;e had no <HI>Divan,</HI> but after the old men came &s;everal Boys, attired with very long Horns, &s;ome of Velvet, whereof they make mens Caps, and o|thers of Cloath of Gold of which they make tho&s;e of the Women; &s;ome a|gain wore Caps, from which hung behind long &s;leeves of the &s;ame &s;tuff, and &s;even or eight men among&s;t them were cloathed all over with the &s;ame &s;tuffs, &s;ome in fa&s;hion of a <HI>Cha&s;ulle,</HI> and others in the manner of <HI>Cappes,</HI> much like to tho&s;e which the Boys of the Quire of <HI>No&s;tre Dame</HI> in <HI>Paris</HI> wear, but that the&s;e drew into a point on the &s;mall of the back, and all were attired

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. IX.</HI> Of the Road to <HI>Mo&s;ul</HI> by <HI>Bir</HI> and <HI>Orfa.</HI></HEAD>
<P>AFter two Months &s;tay in <HI>Aleppo,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Caravans for <HI>Erzerum.</HI></NOTE> I let two Caravans go which were bound for <HI>Erzerum;</HI> becau&s;e one mu&s;t &s;ometimes wait a long while at <HI>Erzerum,</HI> fot a Caravan to <HI>Revan,</HI> and at <HI>Revan</HI> for one to <HI>Tauris,</HI> and in tho&s;e parts the <HI>Francks</HI> have no protection; be&s;ides there is much robbing on that road. At length there was one ready to &s;et out for <HI>Mo&s;ul,</HI> and I re&s;ol|ved to go with it, contrary to the advice of all the <HI>Francks,</HI> who would have per&s;waded me to &s;tay till the heats were over.</P>
<P>I agreed with a <HI>Turk</HI> who had hired &s;everal Mules,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Agreement for tran&s;por|tation from <HI>Aleppo</HI> to <HI>Mo|&s;ul</HI> and <HI>Bag|dad.</HI></NOTE> and gave him thirty <HI>Pia&s;tres,</HI> to tran&s;port me, my man and baggage by Land to <HI>Mo&s;ul,</HI> and from <HI>Mo&s;ul</HI> to <HI>Bagdad</HI> by <HI>Keleck,</HI> and to clear me of all <HI>Caffares;</HI> &s;ome days after he would have three <HI>Pia&s;tres</HI> more, and Cloath-Stockins for four <HI>Pia&s;tres:</HI> I gave him all in hand, as he de&s;ired, though I thought it not the &s;afe&s;t cour&s;e, but onely that I might not baulk a friend from whom I had received many kindne&s;&s;es, and who had made the bargain for me: Seeing he had never tra|velled that Journey him&s;elf, and that he thought every man as hone&s;t as he was, he per&s;waded him&s;elf that he had done very well for me. In the mean time the onely way is, to bargain with the Muletors, and not to pay them in hand; for if I had done &s;o, it would not have co&s;t me &s;o much. That <HI>Turk</HI> payed the Muletor but fifteen <HI>Pia&s;tres</HI> for the two Mules and a half that I had loaded, and all the re&s;t of the Caravan payed no more but &s;ix <HI>Pia&s;tres</HI> a Mule. Be&s;ides,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Six <HI>Pia&s;tres</HI> a Mule.</NOTE> that infidel told me many times upon the road that he had neither agreed for my baggage nor for the <HI>Caffares,</HI> and would have I know not how many <HI>Pia&s;tres</HI> more; and in fine, I was forced to pay new charges from <HI>Mo&s;ul</HI> to <HI>Bagdad.</HI></P>
<P>I parted from <HI>Aleppo</HI> on <HI>Sunday</HI> the nine and twentieth of <HI>June,</HI> accompa|nied with &s;everal <HI>French</HI> Merchants on Hor&s;e-back, who would needs do me that honour, to &s;ee me to the Caravan, which was in the <HI>Meidan,</HI> by the Gardens, clo&s;e by the City. I went out by the Gate <HI>Bab-El-Barkou&s;a,</HI> and my Servant told me who had been there with my Goods two days; that the Night before one of my Fire-locks had been &s;tollen,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Theft.</NOTE> and &s;ome Goods taken from others: It behoved me to be contented &s;ince others were in the &s;ame condition, and that they told me they had &s;een the Thieves and pur|&s;ued them, but could not overtake them. The&s;e thieves &s;lide cunningly along upon their bellies like Snakes; and therefore in all that Journey, they lye not in tents in the Night-time; but on the contrary unpitch them at Night, becau&s;e then, (as they &s;ay,) they &s;erve onely for &s;pectacles to Robbers.</P>
<P>Next morning at the break of day we &s;et forward on our Journey, and were at fir&s;t troubled with cold for &s;ome time. We marched till nine of the Clock and then encamped in a Field called <HI>Sammaia,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Sammaia.</NOTE> near the River of <HI>Aleppo</HI> that runs by this place, and has a little Bridge over it.</P>
<P>We parted from thence on <HI>Tue&s;day</HI> the fir&s;t of <HI>July</HI> about break of day; and about nine a Clock we met a great Caravan coming from <HI>Mo&s;ul,</HI> in which there was a Watch-maker, who came from <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> where he had long lived with his Wife and Children. After we had di&s;cour&s;ed a little toge|ther,
<PB N="40" REF="187">
we parted, there Caravan going on to <HI>Sammaia,</HI> and ours about ten in the morning &s;topping in a field called <HI>Chetanli,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Chetanli.</NOTE> where a little Brook runs a|mong Reeds: From <HI>Aleppo</HI> to that place we had always kept Ea&s;t-North-Ea&s;t, and from thence to <HI>Bir</HI> our way lay Ea&s;t.</P>
<P>Next day being <HI>Wedne&s;day</HI> the &s;econd of <HI>July,</HI> we parted from <HI>Cheranli</HI> about break of day, and about ten in the Morning came to a great Village called <HI>Mazar,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Mazar.</NOTE> near to which we encamped. This place hath much wood and water about it which renders it very plea&s;ant, and here you may &s;ee a very lovely Ca&s;cade of nine or ten Stories which has been made for a Water-mill hard by. We began then to feel it very hot both day and night.</P>
<P>Next morning <HI>July</HI> the third we decamped about two Clock after mid|night; and at break of day pa&s;t betwixt two grounds where a great many Fig-trees were planted in &s;treight rows. About half an hour after &s;even, we marched betwixt two Hillocks, upon one of which to the right hand, there is a Building, with a kind of a Pyramide. Half an hour after we came to the Banks of <HI>Euphrates,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Euphrates.</NOTE> which &s;eemed to me to be no bigger than the River of <HI>Seine;</HI> but they &s;ay it is very broad in Winter, and the truth is, its bed is twice as broad. This River is called <HI>Frat,</HI> and <HI>Mourat Soui,</HI> that's to &s;ay, the water of de&s;ire; becau&s;e, (&s;ay they) a <HI>Calife</HI> of <HI>Bagdad,</HI> having &s;ent for a little of all the Waters of the Countrey,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Water of <HI>Euphrates</HI> is very light.</NOTE> and having cau&s;ed them to be weighed, the Water of <HI>Euphrates</HI> was found to be the lighte&s;t.</P>
<P>This River runs very &s;lowly, and is navigable for little Barks as far up as the place where it joyns the <HI>Tygris;</HI> but great Barks go onely from <HI>Bir</HI> to <HI>Rou&s;vania,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Rou&s;vania.</NOTE> which is a Village di&s;tant from <HI>Bir,</HI> about ten days Journey; and then they unload their Goods, which are carried upon Camels to <HI>Bagdad,</HI> which is but a &s;mall days Journey from it, where they are conveyed by Water upon the <HI>Tygris.</HI> Thus do the barks loaded with gla&s;s (of which I &s;hall pre&s;ently &s;peak,) go to <HI>Ba&s;lora.</HI> Not that this River is &s;o unnavigable, as &s;ome would have it; for whil&s;t I was at <HI>Aleppo,</HI> the <HI>Scheick Bandar</HI> hired a bark to carry by <HI>Euphrates</HI> to <HI>Rou&s;vania</HI> five or &s;ix hundred ca&s;es of gla&s;s, which he &s;ent to the <HI>Indies.</HI> The rea&s;on why great barks go not beyond <HI>Rou&s;vania,</HI> is becau&s;e there are &s;ome Rocks in the River which hinder their pa&s;&s;age, but are avoided by &s;maller Boats. Neverthele&s;s I &s;hould have taken that occa&s;ion to go to <HI>Bagdad,</HI> had I not been told that the barks &s;topped &s;ome days in certain places where the pa&s;&s;age is be&s;t, and go but very &s;lowly, and that be&s;ides, I could not in the lea&s;t &s;tir from the bark without dan|ger of being robbed by the <HI>Arabs,</HI> nor &s;tay on board without being much incommoded by the heat, becau&s;e they have no Deck. I wondered to &s;ee that they who baled up the&s;e Che&s;ts for the <HI>Scheick Bandar,</HI> tumbled them &s;o rudely that they broke all the gla&s;s; but they told me, that it mattered not, though it were all broken into pieces, becau&s;e the <HI>Indian</HI> Men and Women buy it onely to have little pieces &s;et in Rings, which &s;erve them for Looking-gla&s;&s;es to &s;ee them&s;elves in. That gla&s;s is all over laid with Quick-&s;ilver on one &s;ide, and is a very &s;aleable commodity in the <HI>Indies,</HI> and profitable to the Merchants.</P>

The Walls of the Town are en|tire, and as the hou&s;es are, built of little &s;quare Stones, got in the hill, which is all of a &s;oft Rock; but within, there is nothing but Ruines. We encamped on the top of the hill without the Town, and arrived there half an hour after eight; having fir&s;t payed cu&s;tom for all Merchants goods at &s;o much a load, &s;o &s;oon as we cro&s;&s;ed the River. The Burying-place of <HI>Bir</HI> is on the other &s;ide of the River in <HI>Syria;</HI> and they give this rea&s;on for it, that our

Saviour being come as far as <HI>Euphrates,</HI> gave a man a Handkerchief on which his Picture was &s;tamped, that he might therewith go and convert the people of <HI>Me&s;opotamia;</HI> but that this man being curious to &s;ee what it was, and having unfolded the Handkerchief contrary to the commands of our Lord, it flew into a Well, and that our Lord knowing this, &s;aid that that Land was good for nothing, and therefore went no farther; this is the cau&s;e why they will not bury their dead there: Others tell this &s;tory in another manner, which I &s;hall relate when I come to &s;peak of <HI>Orfa.</HI></P>

Next morning being <HI>Sunday</HI> the &s;ixth of <HI>July,</HI> at one a Clock in the Morning, we travelled along a lovely way made in the Rock, two fathom deep, a fathom broad, and eight fathom long, before that way was cut, there was no travelling by that road: Then we went down an ugly de&s;cent which continues as far as the Town of <HI>Orfa,</HI> where we arrived about two a Clock in the Morning, and encamped near the Walls.</P>

<P>Whil&s;t I was at <HI>Orfa</HI> I enquired how they cut men of the Stone there, and a Chirurgeon (the Son of a <HI>Franck</HI> but born in <HI>Aleppo,</HI> called <HI>Domenico Cabei,</HI>) told me that they cut them in the &s;ame manner as in <HI>Europe;</HI> but that there was at that time a <HI>Turk</HI> at <HI>Orfa,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The way of cutting the Stone.</NOTE> who &s;eemed to be a dull blocki&s;h fellow, and yet cut all &s;uccesfully in this manner. He thru&s;t up his finger into the Pati|ents Fundament, and feeling about the Bladder pre&s;ently found the Stone,
<PB N="43" REF="188">
which with the &s;ame finger he brought down as far as the <HI>Scrotum,</HI> and this with the other hand, he opened at the place where the Stone was; after that he &s;titched up the wound, dre&s;&s;ed it with an Ointment, and had been &s;uccesfull in all the Cures he had undertaken. The fame Chirurgeon told me that he had found one in the Bladder of a Child, a few days before I came, which he was to cut very &s;hortly. Bragging a little then of the skill he had in curing fle&s;hy Excre&s;cences upon the Privy parts, I told him that whil&s;t I was at <HI>Ro&s;&s;etto,</HI> a <HI>French</HI> Phy&s;ician called <HI>Mon&s;ieur Sarazin,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The way of curing Excre&s;|cences.</NOTE> cured the&s;e Excre&s;|cences in this manner. He took two &s;ticks, wherewith he &s;eparated that &s;uperfluous Fle&s;h from the parts, &s;o ordering it, that nothing remained under the &s;ticks, but ju&s;t what he was to cut; then holding the two &s;ticks very fa&s;t with one hand, with a <HI>Bi&s;tori</HI> in the other, he cut clear off the &s;uperfluous fle&s;h that was under the &s;ticks: That if he chanced to cut any Ve&s;&s;el, which made a great flux of blood, he had his Buttons ready upon Coals to &s;top it: After that he &s;ewed up the <HI>Scrotum,</HI> and dre&s;&s;ed the wound till it was per|fectly cured. This &s;welling is cau&s;ed by a Carno&s;ity that grows in the <HI>Scro|tum,</HI> under the Privy parts, with Veins by which it is nouri&s;hed: And I told him that that Phy&s;ician had a&s;&s;ured me, that at <HI>Alexandria</HI> he cut from a man a Wen on the&s;e parts that hung down to the very ground, and that having weighed it, it was twenty five pound weight. Seeing he had many Patients come to him, becau&s;e in <HI>Egypt,</HI> mo&s;t are troubled with that di&s;temper, &s;ome more and &s;ome le&s;s, I had the Curio&s;ity to &s;ee one of them, who&s;e <HI>Scrotum</HI> reached almo&s;t to his heels. Having informed the Chirurgeon <HI>Domenico</HI> of this way of Operation, he told me that he had one under hands troubled with the &s;ame di&s;ea&s;e, whom he was to cure, but that though his own way was good, yet he would make tryal of the method of that <HI>Egyptian</HI> Phy&s;ician upon his Patient; and indeed, he propo&s;ed it unto him, a&s;&s;uring him with all that there would remain a hanging skin as long as he lived, which would be very unea&s;ie to him, if he made his ordinary operation upon him; whereas if he did it the other way (that I had taught him,) he would be free from all inconvenience; but the Patient would not admit of it, and told him that another <HI>Franck</HI> had heretofore propo&s;ed to treat him in that manner, but that he would not, and that he had rather have the trouble of that Skin, and run no risk, than to be rid of it with the danger of his life. The Patient was a man above five and fifty years of Age; and to cure him, <HI>Domenico</HI> made an inci&s;ion cro&s;s-ways in his <HI>Scrotum,</HI> and then &s;tript that &s;uperfluous fle&s;h which he cut off; after that he &s;titched up the skin, leaving onely a little place open, to which he applied his Medicines: this piece of fle&s;h was bigger than ones Fi&s;t, and had a great many little veins. Whil&s;t that operation was per|forming, the old man &s;moaked a Pipe of Tobacco, and made no noi&s;e; onely he oftentimes recommended him&s;elf to <HI>Mahomet,</HI> whil&s;t the by &s;tanders prayed for him: but the Chirurgeon that did the operation was &s;o poor that he had not &s;o much as a Button or actual cautery.</P>
<P><HI>Wedne&s;day</HI> the ninth of <HI>July</HI> in the Evening, the Officer of the Cu&s;tom-hou&s;e came to demand his dues from our Caravan, and took my Sword out of my Tent, which he left in the hands of the <HI>Kervan-Ba&s;&s;a,</HI> pretending a <HI>Pia&s;tre</HI> from me as being a <HI>Franck;</HI> but having &s;poken to my <HI>Moucre,</HI> he went and brought back my Sword.</P>
<P>Next day a Thief &s;tole the <HI>Doliman</HI> or long Coat of one of our Company;<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Thief.</NOTE> but after a very bold, and in &s;ome manner plea&s;ant way.

In the mean time the onely remedy was not to talk of it; for if the <HI>Sousba&s;ha</HI> had come to know it, he would have come to the Hou&s;e and &s;eized all that he found in it, prote&s;ting that there were no Thieves in the Town, and that the Theft mu&s;t

<P>Next day <HI>Thur&s;day</HI> the &s;eventeenth of <HI>July,</HI> we parted from thence about three quarters after two in the Morning, and continued our way Ea&s;t-South-Ea&s;t; we entered among the Mountains, where for almo&s;t an hour we did nothing but climb up and down in ways full of great &s;tones; having pa&s;t them, and got again into the plain, we kept on the &s;ame cour&s;e ap|proaching to the <HI>Caradgia</HI> Mountains: Half an hour after &s;ix we found a Well of good Spring-water;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Maes, Sarazin <HI>Corn.</HI> Ricinus, Pal|ma Chri&s;ti.</NOTE> at &s;even we &s;aw a Field &s;owed with <HI>Maez</HI> or <HI>Sarazin</HI> Corn; and another full of <HI>Ricinus</HI> or <HI>Palma Chri&s;ti,</HI> at mo&s;t but a foot high; a great many draw Oil from it for Lamps, and to rub the Camels with, to make their hair come; for it falls off every year.</P>
<P>Having then pa&s;&s;ed by a great many &s;orry Ruines of hou&s;es, and cro&s;&s;ed a little Brook, about half an hour after nine we were got by a large round Pond full of yellowi&s;h Rain-water, where the <HI>Curds</HI> were watering a great number of Cattel; of which the chief and mo&s;t common are black Goats of who&s;e hair they make their Tents.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Village of <HI>Teldgizre.</HI> Mount <HI>Taurus.</HI></NOTE>Half an hour after ten we pa&s;&s;ed by a great Village, called <HI>Teldgizre,</HI> which was to our left; and then we were got &s;o near Mount <HI>Taurus</HI> that was al&s;o to our left, that it was not above an hours march to the foot of it:
<PB N="47" REF="190">
following the current of a little Brook, which was on the &s;ame &s;ide, half an hour after eleven, we came and encamped near a great Village called <HI>Kizilken,</HI> by which that rivulet runs. I ob&s;erved on the way that day, that they were but then cutting down their Corn, whereas at <HI>Aleppo,</HI> they begin to cut a|bout the end of <HI>May,</HI> or beginning of <HI>June.</HI> After we were encamped we felt, (notwith&s;tanding our Pavillions) &s;o hot a Wind,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A hot Wind.</NOTE> that it &s;eemed to have mu&s;tered together, and brought with it all the heat of the Air, and I think that a man &s;tanding near a great flame, which the Wind blew upon his face, could not feel a hotter Air.</P>
<P><HI>Kizilken</HI> is a great Village all inhabited by <HI>Syrians:</HI> we found &s;ome <HI>Carpous,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Kizilken.</NOTE> or water-Mellons there, which were ripe and good, and the&s;e did us a great deal of kindne&s;s. In the night-time there came Robbers &s;everal times; but they that watched, making as if they would fire upon them, they made &s;ome &s;illy excu&s;es and marched away.</P>
<P>From <HI>Kizilken</HI> we parted next day being <HI>Friday</HI> the eighteenth of <HI>July,</HI> half an hour after one of the Clock in the Morning, and continued our way Ea&s;t-South Ea&s;t; about four a Clock we &s;aw on our right hand two very &s;olid well built hou&s;es, but abandoned, as well as the old Ruines that were to our left. Half an hour after &s;even, we arrived at a great Village, called <HI>Kodgia&s;ar,</HI> where the Cu&s;tomer came to take his dues,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Kodgia&s;ar.</NOTE> but not knowing that I was a <HI>Franck,</HI> asked me nothing. In former times it was a very great Town, and &s;ome very high and &s;ub&s;tantial Buildings &s;till remain; and among&s;t others a &s;pacious Church rarely well built. Fir&s;t you enter into a large Court, along which &s;tands the Church that hath &s;even doors all &s;topt up, except the middlemo&s;t which hath a great Nich on each &s;ide; over the&s;e doors there has been Mo&s;aick work, the place whereof is &s;till to be ob&s;erved, and at the four Corners of the Court there has been four very high &s;quare Steeples co|vered with little Domes, of which (at pre&s;ent) there are onely three remain|ing, and of the&s;e too, but one entire: The other two want onely the Dome; they are built of pretty little Free-&s;tones, with Ornaments of Architecture, and &s;o is the Church al&s;o, the middle wherof is covered with a Dome rough ca&s;t over, and the Walls &s;upported by good large &s;tone-Buttere&s;&s;es. The <HI>Turks</HI> having converted it into a Mo&s;que, have made a Keble in it, and a little Pulpit to preach in. Near to this Town, runs a Water that pa&s;&s;es under a Bridge of five Arches; to &s;ay the truth, it is not very good, but there are good Wells, and each hou&s;e has one: There is one in the middle of the Court of that Church, and hard by it, a kind of Dome &s;upported by &s;everal Pillars; but for what u&s;e I know not, unle&s;s it be to wa&s;h in, as the <HI>Turks</HI> do when they go to their Mo&s;que.</P>
<P><HI>Kodgia&s;ar</HI> is over again&s;t <HI>Merdin</HI> that &s;tands upon a hill to the North-Ea&s;t of it; the Ca&s;tle is on the very top of the hill, and is &s;een at a great di&s;tance,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Merdin.</NOTE> being four hours Journey from <HI>Kodgia&s;ar.</HI> The Cu&s;tomer of <HI>Merdin</HI> came to our Camp for his dues, and demanded of me as a <HI>Franck,</HI> five <HI>Pia&s;tres,</HI> and therefore made my man Pri&s;oner; but my <HI>Moucre</HI> brought him out, he was informed that I was a <HI>Franck,</HI> by a <HI>Turk</HI> of the Caravan, who was the onely man of them all that &s;hewed any aver&s;ion to me.</P>
<P>The Ca&s;tle of <HI>Merdin</HI> is &s;o &s;trong, that the <HI>Turks</HI> &s;ay no Army is able to take it, &s;eeing they have both Spring-water and Ci&s;tern-water. They will have it, that <HI>Tamarlan</HI> lay &s;even years before this Ca&s;tle, who (to &s;hew them that he would continue there untill it were taken) cau&s;ed the Trees below it to be cut down, and new ones planted, of the fruit of which, (when they began to bear,) he &s;ent to the Garri&s;on; and that the be&s;ieged to make the be&s;t &s;hew they could, &s;ent him Chee&s;e made of Bitches milk, as if it had been of the Milk of Ewes, which wrought a good effect; for he was per&s;waded by that, that they had not as yet &s;pent their &s;heep, and de&s;pairing to force them, he rai&s;ed the Siege, though he had prevailed in all the other Sieges that he attempted.</P>
<P>There is a <HI>Ba&s;ha</HI> at <HI>Merdin,</HI> and almo&s;t all the Inhabitants of <HI>Kodgia&s;ar</HI> are Robbers.

antiquities &s;tanding in &s;everal places. The &s;ame <HI>Saturday</HI> the nineteenth of <HI>July,</HI> there arrived a little Caravan near to our Camp, which came from <HI>Aleppo,</HI> and was going to <HI>Van.</HI></P>
<P>On <HI>Sunday</HI> the twentieth of <HI>July,</HI> we parted from <HI>Kodgia&s;ar,</HI> about three a clock in the morning; half an hour after five, we pa&s;t by a great Village, called <HI>Toubija&s;a,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Toubija&s;a.</NOTE> which was on our left hand, and is onely inhabited by <HI>Syri|ans:</HI> So &s;oon as we pa&s;&s;ed it, we came into a great plain &s;owed with Cucum|bers and Melons,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Field of Melons and Cucumbers.</NOTE> of which tho&s;e of our Caravan took as many as they could eat and carry with them, notwith&s;tanding the Cries of the poor People, Men, Women and Children, who had no better payment than ill words, as if they had been much in the wrong for complaining that their Goods were forcibly taken from them. About nine a Clock we pa&s;&s;ed a little Water, and after that, found the Tents of &s;ome <HI>Curds,</HI> three quarters after nine, we encamped near a Village called <HI>Futlidge,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Futlidge.</NOTE> near to which there is a Well of good Water; in Winter they encamp at a Village near the Mountains,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Caradere.</NOTE> called <HI>Caradere,</HI> a little on this &s;ide, becau&s;e there are Grotto's in them to lodge in.</P>
<P>We parted about two of the Clock in the Morning, directing our way Ea&s;t-South-Ea&s;t; &s;uch hot Vapours &s;teemed out of the Earth, that (for breath, and that I might not be &s;tiffled) I was forced to fan my &s;elf; which made me think of the <HI>Sausiel,</HI> which I had already heard &s;o much of. Half an hour after five, we &s;aw on the &s;ide of the way to the left, the Ruines of a great Ca&s;tle called <HI>Sert&s;chehan,</HI> of which &s;everal panels of Wall &s;till &s;tand.</P>
<P>About eight of the Clock we found &s;ome Tents of the <HI>Curds;</HI> and then cro&s;&s;ed at lea&s;t twelve Canals one after another, which di&s;charge their Water at <HI>Ni&s;ibin,</HI> where we arrived three quarters of an hour after eight, and en|camped beyond the Bridge, which con&s;i&s;ts of eleven &s;mall Arches, under which a great Water runs, which is divided into three by plowed Fields, that reach even to the Bridge, and render three of its Arches u&s;ele&s;s: They call all the&s;e the Waters of <HI>Ni&s;ibin;</HI> for ask them the Name of a River in what manner you plea&s;e, they'll give you no other but the Name of the place it runs by. This water comes from the Mountains, and before it reach <HI>Ni&s;ibin,</HI> they cut it into &s;everal Channels for watering of their grounds that are planted with Cotton, rice and other things which require Water. That's a heavy and unwhol&s;ome Water, and &s;o is the Air, which is &s;o bad, that I was told that if one &s;leep in it by day or by night, he runs a great risk of being &s;ick, and that is the rea&s;on why the People of the Countrey are &s;o taw+ny as they are.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ni&s;ibin.</NOTE><HI>Ni&s;ibin</HI> was formerly a great Town, at pre&s;ent it is divided into two quar|ters &s;eparated by a plowed field, and both the&s;e quarters make but an ordi|nary Village.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mar-Jacob.</NOTE> Heretofore it had a Church dedicated to <HI>Mar-Jacob,</HI> that's to &s;ay St. <HI>James</HI> who is called the Brother of our Lord; It was very large, but at pre&s;ent there is nothing to be &s;een but the Arches of the doors, and a &s;mall &s;pace, which was, (as I think,) the end of the Church, walled up by the <HI>Syrians,</HI> where they and the <HI>Armenians</HI> at pre&s;ent celebrate Ma&s;s. The Cu&s;tomer of <HI>Ni&s;ibin</HI> came and demanded his dues of our Caravan, though <HI>Ni&s;ibin</HI> depend on the <HI>Ba&s;ha</HI> of <HI>Merdin,</HI> the Cu&s;tomer of which had already taken his dues at <HI>Kodgia&s;ar,</HI> but he took nothing from me, becau&s;e he thought I was a <HI>Greek.</HI></P>
<P>We parted from <HI>Ni&s;ibin</HI> next day being <HI>Tue&s;day</HI> the two and twentieth of <HI>July,</HI> about one a Clock in the Morning by Star-light, and pa&s;&s;ed another Canal; a &s;trong North-Wind blew then, which hardly cooled the Air. About five of the Clock we began to &s;ee on our right hand the Mountains <HI>Sendgiar</HI> which reach from North-We&s;t to South-Ea&s;t,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mountain <HI>Sendgiar.</HI></NOTE> but they were about two days Journey di&s;tant from us. Half an hour after &s;even we cro&s;&s;ed a water, half an hour after eight, another, and a quarter after nine we pa&s;&s;ed a third, which was very lovely,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dgerrahhi Soui.</NOTE> and called <HI>Dgerrahhi Soui:</HI> We thought to have en|camped near it as is u&s;ual, but becau&s;e the Mules mu&s;t have been &s;ent to gra&s;e on the other &s;ide, and that it would have been trouble&s;ome to make them cro&s;s it back again in the Evening; we went farther, and encamped near to a Spring of good Water,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Kimarlick.</NOTE> in a place called <HI>Kimarlick,</HI> from which we parted about eleven of the Clock at Night, and cro&s;&s;ed a great Water, where
<PB N="49" REF="191">
our Caravan was a long time in pa&s;&s;ing it, becau&s;e of the dark, and of the many great Stones that are in the Water; when we pa&s;&s;ed it, we &s;tood away Ea&s;twards.</P>
<P><HI>Wedne&s;day</HI> the three and twentieth of <HI>July,</HI> about two a Clock in the Mor|ning, we found another Water, and another again about four a Clock, and three quarters of an hour after, a very plea&s;ant little River, which turns and winds through a &s;mall plain encompa&s;&s;ed with hills.</P>
<P>Three quarters after five, we &s;aw by the way to our left a Hillock, on the top of which there is a Dome, under which lies buried one <HI>Imam Ahmed,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Imam-Ahmed.</NOTE> for whom the <HI>Turks</HI> have great Veneration, and this is a place of Pilgrimage. About &s;even a Clock we pa&s;&s;ed by a &s;orry Village called <HI>Candgi,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Candgi.</NOTE> and half an hour after, we encamped near a Spring of good Water, in a plain called by the Name of the Village. The Inhabitants thereabouts are &s;o given to thieving, that they &s;tay not for the Night as others do; but come into the Camp in the day-time, under pretext of &s;elling Corn for the Hor&s;es; and walking up and down, (if they perceive any thing not well looked after,) they fail not to lift it.</P>
<P>We parted from thence, the &s;ame day about half an hour after &s;even of the Clock at Night, and marched Ea&s;t-South-Ea&s;t: It was extreamly hot till about two a Clock next Morning, that the Air grew cooler. We marched without finding Water or Habitation, untll half an hour after &s;ix, that we came and encamped in a plain called <HI>Adgi&s;ou,</HI> becau&s;e of a water that runs there among the reeds, and is bitter, according as I had been told, that from <HI>Candgi,</HI> to <HI>Mo&s;ul,</HI> there was neither habitation nor good water; which made me provide my &s;elf before hand; neverthele&s;s having ta&s;ted it, I did not find it to be &s;o bitter.</P>
<P><HI>Friday</HI> the five and twentieth of <HI>July</HI> we parted from <HI>Adgi&s;ou,</HI> half an hour after three in the Morning, for we were not willing to travel in the Night-time for fear of the <HI>Arabs.</HI> We marched South, and about eight of the Clock, cro&s;&s;ed a Brook of bitter water; half an hour after, we cro&s;&s;ed ano|ther, who&s;e water was pretty good; upon a hillock clo&s;e by, there &s;tands a wall, which &s;eems to have been the Wall of a Ca&s;tle whereof there is no more remaining. Half an hour after nine, we cro&s;&s;ed a great Brook of brack|i&s;h Water, and three quarters after eleven, a &s;mall River that runs under a Bridge of four Arches, of which two are broken, and indeed, they &s;eem to be u&s;ele&s;s, for the breadth of the water reaches but to the two that are whole, and it mu&s;t needs be very high when it pa&s;&s;es through the other two which &s;tand upon a pretty high ground: This Bridge is below a little ruinous Ca&s;tle &s;tanding upon a hillock; it hath been &s;quare, but there is nothing remaining but the four Walls, and a little round Tower in a corner. We encamped clo&s;e by this Ca&s;tle, all &s;corched with the Sun, and &s;tewed in Sweat; that place is called <HI>Ke&s;ick-Cupri,</HI> that's to &s;ay, broken Bridge,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ke&s;ick-Cupri.</NOTE> and the Water is called <HI>Cupri-Sou,</HI> that's to &s;ay, the Bridge-water, and no other Names of Rivers are to be got from them.</P>
<P>I informed my &s;elf of the &s;ource of that River,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An errour in Geography.</NOTE> which <HI>San&s;on</HI> &s;eems to have confounded with that of <HI>Ni&s;ibin,</HI> and I was told that it was another, and that the &s;ource is not far from that Bridge. This water is not very good but it is not bitter, (as I had been told,) and clo&s;e by it there is a Fountain of far wor&s;e water. We left that place the &s;ame day, three quarters after &s;even at Night, and took our way Ea&s;t-ward. About eleven a Clock we pa&s;&s;ed by a Village called <HI>Wlhayat,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Wlhayat.</NOTE> which is wholly for&s;aken becau&s;e of the Tyranny of the <HI>Turks.</HI> At midnight we had a great Allarm, but we found it onely to be twelve Hor&s;e-men armed with Muskets, who came from <HI>Mo&s;ul,</HI> where we arrived the &s;ix and twentieth of <HI>July</HI> three quarters of an hour after five in the Morning: A little before we came there, one of our Company having alighted, and returning back to look for his Sword which he had dropt, was &s;tript of all by the <HI>Arabs.</HI></P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Mo&s;ul.</NOTE>WE entered <HI>Mo&s;ul</HI> by <HI>Bagdad Capi&s;i</HI> that looks to the South, and at that Gate I payed a <HI>Pia&s;tre</HI> to the <HI>Jani&s;&s;aries.</HI></P>
<P>I went and lodged with the <HI>Capucins,</HI> who were lately arrived there, to &s;ettle a mi&s;&s;ion, by orders of the Congregation, <HI>de propaganda fide,</HI> and therefore, as yet they were but very ill accommodated; but a hou&s;e was a preparing for them, which a <HI>Syrian</HI> Prie&s;t had let them at a pretty dear rate: There were but two <HI>Capucins</HI> there, to wit, the Reverend Father <HI>John,</HI> and brother <HI>George,</HI> who charitably admini&s;tred Phy&s;ick to all the People without di&s;tinction of Religion: This, with the knowledge he had of all Di&s;ea&s;es, dew &s;o many &s;ick People to their hou&s;e, that it was always as full as an Ho&s;pital: They came to him even ten days Journey off, and the mo&s;t powerfull &s;ent and prayed him to come to them from all parts of <HI>Me&s;opotamia.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Aa&s;our.</NOTE>The City of <HI>Mo&s;ul,</HI> anciently called <HI>Aa&s;our</HI> &s;tands upon the &s;ide of the <HI>Tigris</HI> which runs to the Ea&s;t of it; it is encompa&s;&s;ed with Walls of rough &s;tone pla&s;tered over, with little pointed Battlements on the top, two fingers breadth thick, and four or five broad, much like to wooden Pales. I think that one may walk round this Town in an hours time, there is a Ca&s;tle in the water, which is narrow, but reaches out in length from North to South, and is almo&s;t of an oval figure: towards the River it is all built of Free &s;tone, and the Walls are about three fathom high, on the land-&s;ide it is &s;eparated from the Town by a ditch, five or &s;ix fathom broad and very deep, being fil|led with the River-Water; and in this place it is about four fathom deep; but is not faced with Free-&s;tone above one fathom high, from the foundation, and the re&s;t is only rough Stone. The entry into it is on the &s;ide of the Town, and the Gate is in the middle of a great &s;quare Tower built upon a &s;trong and large Arch, under which runs the Water of the ditch; and there is a little Draw-Bridge to be pa&s;t before one comes to the Gate, which heretofore was &s;trongly defended by Artillery; for before it on the out&s;ide there are &s;ix large Guns &s;till to be &s;een, but one of them is broken, and but one mounted; there are about as many field-pieces, and onely two of them mounted; I was told that this Ca&s;tle was built by the Chri&s;tians, and that there is a fair Church within it.</P>
<P>The <HI>Tigris</HI> &s;eems to be &s;omewhat broader than the River of <HI>Seine,</HI> but is very deep and rapid; neverthele&s;s it has a Bridge of Boats over it, a little be|low the Ca&s;tle, and oppo&s;ite to one of the Gates of the City called <HI>Dge&s;ir Capi&s;i,</HI> that's to &s;ay the Bridge-Gate: It con&s;i&s;ts of about thirty Boats, on which they pa&s;s to an I&s;le, the other end reaches not the Land, unle&s;s it be by a Stone-Cau&s;ey, which is as long as the Bridge it &s;elf where it ends. In Winter that Bridge is removed, becau&s;e the River (then overflowing,) becomes as broad again as it is in Summer: A few paces from the River-&s;ide, there are large Ditches which it fills with water, that is drawn out from thence for watering their grounds; and that (I think) by a very &s;illy invention. They have great Buckets of Leather that hold more than a Barrel; and at the bot|tom of the Bucket there is a large Pipe of Leather, about three foot long; &s;uch as I have in former times &s;een at <HI>Paris</HI> fa&s;tened to Casks full of water, which &s;erved to water the <HI>Cours de la Reine.</HI> This Bucket is fa&s;tened to a Rope, put over a wheel, that turns upon an Axletree who&s;e ends enter into the Penthou&s;es that are on each &s;ide of the Well; and there is another Cord fa&s;tened to the Mouth of the Bucket, that holds it upright to keep the water from &s;pilling, and this la&s;t Cord goes under the wheel; the&s;e two Cords are fa&s;tened together to a great Rope: and becau&s;e it requires &s;everal men to
<PB N="51" REF="192">
draw the Bucket full of Water, they fa&s;ten this great Rope to an Ox, whom they drive foreward about twenty paces in de&s;cent, that he may draw more ea&s;ily and fa&s;t. When the Bucket is up, they let the water run out at the Pipe into a little furrow, from whence it &s;preads over their grounds: When that is done, they bring the Ox back again, and &s;o &s;et him a drawing as before. I cannot tell why in this Countrey and in <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> they make no u&s;e of Pou&s;&s;eragues as in <HI>Egypt</HI> and the We&s;t of <HI>Turky.</HI></P>
<P>Whil&s;t I was at <HI>Mo&s;ul</HI> the Cu&s;tomer (who learnt that I was a <HI>Franck,</HI>) &s;ent for me and my &s;ervant, and having pre&s;ented me with Coffee, he deman|ded of me ten <HI>Pia&s;tres,</HI> for the Cu&s;tome of two load of Goods which he &s;aid I had; I pretended not to under&s;tand neither <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> nor <HI>Arabick,</HI> it be|ing be&s;t to do &s;o (when one is known to be a <HI>Franck,</HI>) for many rea&s;ons. I told him then by an Interpreter that I had not two load of Goods, and that they were onely Books: By chance there was a <HI>Syrian</HI> Merchant there, called <HI>Codgia Elias,</HI> who is very powerfull in <HI>Mo&s;ul</HI> and a friend of the <HI>Capu|cins,</HI> and he had bu&s;ine&s;s with the Cu&s;tomer; this <HI>Codgia</HI> &s;eeing me, took two <HI>Pia&s;tres</HI> out of his Pur&s;e which he threw to the Cu&s;tomer, praying him to let me go for that; but this (genero&s;ity of a man whom I knew not) making me di&s;tru&s;t him, I bid tell him that if he laid out any thing for me, I could not repay it; this put the Cu&s;tomer into &s;o great a pa&s;&s;ion, that having abu|&s;ed my &s;ervant with his tongue, he &s;ent him away to pri&s;on; for my part, I &s;tayed there, and he &s;till treated me calmly and civilly enough. At length <HI>Codgia Elias,</HI> offering to pull out more Money; I made him plainly to un|der&s;tand by Signs, that I would not repay it; wherefore he put up his Money again, and departed not well &s;atisfied with me; though he brought my Servant back from pri&s;on again, to whom the Cu&s;tomer gave leave to go to my Lodging for one of my Books that he might &s;ee it; he came back and Father <HI>John</HI> with him, who ordered matters &s;o that I came off for two <HI>Pia&s;tres.</HI> I thought it might not be unprofitable to relate the&s;e things,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Profitable ad|vice.</NOTE> which &s;eem to be but trifles, and yet may &s;erve for a le&s;&s;on to the <HI>Francks,</HI> who travel in <HI>Turky,</HI> when they find them&s;elves in the like Circum&s;tances, and in places where there is no Con&s;ul nor Merchants; for where there is any, it is be&s;t to let them to whom you are recommended act, becau&s;e they know the humour of the Cu&s;tomers, and how they are to be dealt with. Not that I pretend that my conduct &s;hould &s;erve for a model to others, but I think the&s;e are hints that can do no hurt, and may do good; &s;eeing when one is in&s;tructed before hand, he may better take his mea&s;ures as to what he is to &s;ay and do upon the like occa&s;ions: For my own part, (I thank God,) I came off very well in my own way, and I always perceived, that one mu&s;t be as &s;low as he can in putting his hand in his Pocket in that Countrey: Becau&s;e when you are known to be a <HI>Franck,</HI> if you pull out your Money as &s;oon as they demand it, they never leave off as long as they can &s;queeze one penny more from you. The Name of a <HI>Franck</HI> &s;o tickles them, that when any &s;uch fall into their hands, they drain from him all that they can, imagining that <HI>Francks</HI> never travel but with Pur&s;es full of <HI>Chequins.</HI> One mu&s;t like|wi&s;e have a &s;pecial care not to let them &s;ee Gold, but onely white Money, and as little of that too as may be, and in &s;hort, one &s;hould have the cunning to pa&s;s for a poor Man. And therefore in the&s;e my la&s;t Travels I wore al|ways mean Apparel, &s;o long as I was in <HI>Turky:</HI> The be&s;t way in the world would be not to pa&s;s for a <HI>Franck,</HI> if it could po&s;&s;ibly be done, and I was &s;o well di&s;gui&s;ed when I parted from <HI>Legorn,</HI> (that under&s;tanding Turki&s;h,) I &s;ucceeded in it; not in <HI>Alexandria</HI> where I was too well known, &s;ince the fir&s;t time I had been there, but at <HI>Ro&s;&s;etto,</HI> and <HI>Saide;</HI> but from that time forward, (travelling always with tho&s;e who had &s;een me with <HI>Franks,</HI>) they pre&s;ently blazed it abroad that I was a <HI>Franck.</HI></P>

<P>A little more up on land on the &s;ame &s;ide, is the Tomb of <HI>Jonas</HI> in the Mo&s;que of a Village, but I went not thither becau&s;e of the exce&s;&s;ive heat: For two hours after Sun-ri&s;ing there is no po&s;&s;ibility of &s;tirring abroad, till at lea&s;t an hour after it is &s;et; the Walls be&s;ides are &s;o hot, that half a foot from them, one feels the heat, as if it were of a hot Iron; and therefore du|ring the Summer all &s;leep in the Night-time upon Terra&s;&s;es in the open Air, both Men and Women: And the la&s;t of <HI>July</HI> I ob&s;erved in my Thermome|tre expo&s;ed to the Sun,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The degres of heat at <HI>Mo&s;ul.</HI></NOTE> &s;even and thirty degrees of heat. In &s;hort, the heat in <HI>Me&s;opotamia</HI> is certainly exce&s;&s;ive; and though (when I travelled there,) I wore upon my head a great black handkerchief, like a Womans hood, that I might &s;ee through (becau&s;e the <HI>Turks</HI> commonly u&s;e the&s;e handkerchiefs upon the road;) neverthele&s;s, I had many times my Fore-head &s;corched; that's to &s;ay, it became all over red, after which it &s;welled exceedingly, and then the skin came off; my hands were al&s;o continually &s;corched. Some al&s;o in the Caravan had their Eyes daily &s;corched; and the remedy for it is a powder made of Sugar and long Pepper beat very &s;mall; which being well mixt, is put into a pur&s;e, or rather a long narrow bag, and when there is occa&s;ion for it, they take a skewer like a bodkin of wood &s;o long as to reach to the bottom of the bag, ad having taken it out full of that powder draw it along betwixt the Eye and Eye-lid, where it leaves all the powder that &s;tuck to it; and this mu&s;t be done to each Eye &s;everally.</P>
<P>In the City of <HI>Mo&s;ul</HI> there is a Mo&s;que divided into &s;everal I&s;les by means of many arched Roofs; it is adorned with Plai&s;ter-work as the former, but much decayed;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Plai&s;ter.</NOTE> it is at lea&s;t as big as <HI>No&s;tre Dame</HI> of <HI>Paris.</HI> The plai&s;ter, where|with they emblelli&s;h the&s;e Mo&s;ques, is made of a certain Stone which they burn, and then break and cru&s;h with rowlers drawn by Hor&s;es. The hou&s;es of this Town are ill built, and are rather ruines than hou&s;es, even the <HI>Ba&s;ha</HI>'s own <HI>Serraglio,</HI> (for <HI>Mo&s;ul</HI> is a Ba&s;ha&s;hip) being a very &s;orry place.</P>
<P>In this Countrey and in the re&s;t of <HI>A&s;&s;yria</HI> the Melons are not rough and in a manner carved, as in <HI>Europe;</HI> but they are long, have a very &s;mooth skin, and for the mo&s;t part the fle&s;h white. They are very good, and eat as if they were full of Sugar; but they are gathered &s;o ripe, that one may ea&s;ily eat them with a &s;poon; and the <HI>Levantines</HI> generally eat them &s;o. There are al&s;o &s;ome little round Melons which are white within and eat very &s;hort, but they are not &s;o good. When we came to <HI>Poul</HI> in <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> we found &s;ome of the &s;ame &s;hape; but yet are of a quite different nature, for they are never over ripe, and I have eat of one that looked firm and green, which I found to be very good; and neverthele&s;s all the &s;eeds were already &s;prouted out an inch long, nay it had a little Melon full &s;haped of the bigne&s;s of a Nut, with a tail, to which the &s;eeds that produced it were &s;till &s;ticking; it was not round, but wanted not much of it, and had the form that it could take in the vacuity it met with: Having cut it I found &s;eeds in it, but &s;o

<P>Whil&s;t I was at <HI>Mo&s;ul,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Eclip&s;e of the Moon.</NOTE> there happened an Eclip&s;e of the Moon on the &s;eventh of <HI>Augu&s;t;</HI> it began about one a Clock after midnight, and la&s;ted till four in the Morning; during all which time the Moon &s;eemed to be of the colour of bloud. All the while it la&s;ted, the Terra&s;&s;es were full of Peo|ple, who made a continual cla&s;hing din with their Kettles which they beat with &s;ticks, and that to frighten a huge Bea&s;t which, (the People of the Coun|trey &s;ay,) would devour the Moon. I learnt from a knowing man, that the Authour of that <HI>Mummery</HI> was an A&s;trologer, who foretold to a King an Eclip&s;e of the Moon; which &s;tirred up his curio&s;ity to de&s;ire to &s;ee it: But having waited &s;ometime, (though the moment prefixt by the A&s;trologer drew nigh,) he grew impatient, and becau&s;e the Eclip&s;e happened not &s;o &s;oon as he would have had it, he di&s;charged his choler upon the A&s;trologer, as he who ought to have an&s;wered for it, and then fell a&s;leep. In the mean time, the Eclip&s;e beginning &s;hortly after, the A&s;trologer was in a new perplexity; becau&s;e on the one hand he dur&s;t not awaken the King, and on the other, he was afraid that if he did not awake before the Eclip&s;e was over, he would not believe it, and yet make him feel the bad influences of the &s;ame. To be &s;hort, that he might come off the be&s;t way he could, he in|vented a tale to the People, and told them that there was a huge Bea&s;t which had a mind to devour the Moon, and that to &s;care it away they mu&s;t make a great deal of noi&s;e, which they did, and by that means awakened the King. Neverthele&s;s, it &s;eems that the <HI>Romans</HI> had this cu&s;tom of making a noi&s;e with Kettles and Drums to a&s;&s;i&s;t the Moon when &s;he laboured in an Eclip&s;e, as may be &s;een in the &s;ixth Satyr of <HI>Juvenal.</HI></P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. XII.</HI> Of the Wind <HI>Samiel,</HI> the <HI>Kelecks,</HI> and the Au|thours embarking in that kind of Ve&s;&s;el.</HEAD>
<P>WHen we came to <HI>Mo&s;ul,</HI> it was re&s;olved that five <HI>Kelecks</HI> &s;hould be made, becau&s;e many of the Caravan had a mind to go by Water, to the end they might avoid the <HI>Samiel,</HI> and I was one of tho&s;e.</P>
<P>The re&s;t departed on <HI>Wedne&s;day</HI> the thirtieth of <HI>July,</HI> and took their way through <HI>Me&s;opotamia,</HI> which is certainly the &s;horte&s;t; but no Village to be found upon the Road, and two days after, we had news that &s;ix of them were already dead. Within a few days more came the <HI>Hazna,</HI> which is the money for paying the Soldiers of <HI>Bagdad,</HI> and becau&s;e the <HI>Kelecks</HI> were long in making, a great many took that occa&s;ion, and on <HI>Wedne&s;day</HI> the &s;ixth of <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> went away with the <HI>Hazna</HI> through <HI>Curdi&s;tan,</HI> and cro&s;&s;ed the Water upon the Bridge of <HI>Mo&s;ul.</HI> That is the longe&s;t way, but there are &s;everal Villages upon the Road, and my <HI>Moucre</HI> had a mind I &s;hould go that way; however I would not partly becau&s;e of the <HI>Samiel,</HI> and partly al&s;o for fear he might play me &s;ome trick; becau&s;e I had refu&s;ed him &s;ome <HI>Pia&s;tres</HI> that he would have had over and above our bargain, though he had been already payed double; and therefore he went away and left me.<NOTE PLACE="marg">A profitable advice.</NOTE> This ought to be a le&s;&s;on never to pay that &s;ort of men before hand. Next day after they were gone, the news came that nine of them were dying.</P>
<P><PB N="54" REF="194"><NOTE PLACE="marg">Samiel.</NOTE>But having &s;poken &s;o much of the <HI>Samiel,</HI> it is but rea&s;onable I &s;hould re|late what I have been told of it; <HI>Sam</HI> in <HI>Arabick,</HI> &s;ignifies poy&s;on, and <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">iel</HI> in <HI>Turki&s;h,</HI> wind; &s;o that that compound word &s;ignifies <HI>Poy&s;on-wind,</HI> and it may be the <HI>ventus urens,</HI> or Ea&s;t Wind, of which <HI>Job</HI> &s;peaks in the one and twen|tieth Chapter of his Book. Having with much curio&s;ity informed my &s;elf of that Wind, all told me the &s;ame thing, that it is a very hot Wind that reigns in Summer from <HI>Mo&s;ul</HI> to <HI>Surrat</HI> but onely by Land, and not upon the Wa|ter; and that they who have breathed that Wind, fall in&s;tantly dead upon the place, though &s;ometimes they have the time to &s;ay that they burn with|in. No &s;ooner does a man dye by this Wind, but he becomes as black as a coal, and if one take him by the Leg, Arm or any other place; his fle&s;h comes from the bone, and is plucked off by the hand that would lift him up. They &s;ay that in this Wind there are &s;treaks of fire as &s;mall as a hair, which have been &s;een by &s;ome, and that they who breath in tho&s;e rays of fire dye of them, the re&s;t receiving no prejudice; if it be &s;o, it may be thought that the&s;e fires volant proceed from &s;ulphurous exhalations that ri&s;e out of the Earth, which being to&s;&s;ed by the Wind, kindle, (for they are inflameable) and being with the Air &s;ucked in by re&s;piration, con&s;ume the entrals in a moment. Or otherwi&s;e, if it be no more but a bare Wind, that Wind mu&s;t be &s;o hot, that in an in&s;tant it corrupts the whole body it enters into; and if it kill no body upon the Water, the rea&s;on mu&s;t be, that the&s;e enflamed Vapours are di&s;&s;ipated or extingui&s;hed by the exhalations that con|tinually ri&s;e out of the water, which are gro&s;s and humid; or becau&s;e there is always a cool breez upon the water. However leaving the di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of this point to the learned, what I have related of the effects of the <HI>Samiel</HI> is certainly true, for I have informed my &s;elf thereof by many, mo&s;t of whom have &s;een and handled tho&s;e that have died of it, which is very common in Sum|mer: If that Wind reign from <HI>Mo&s;ul</HI> to <HI>Surrat</HI> (as &s;ome &s;ay,) it mu&s;t be a|long the Water-&s;ide; for over land there are many places where it reigns not at all.</P>
<P>Having been &s;o well informed then of that Wind, I re&s;olved not to run the hazard of &s;uffering by it; but becau&s;e many were gone with the <HI>Hazna,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Kelecks.</NOTE> they could hardly re&s;olve at <HI>Mo&s;ul</HI> to make <HI>Kelecks,</HI> which is a kind of boat, wherein there is neither peg, nail, nor indeed, any bit of Iron; though it be made up of at lea&s;t of as many pieces as our boats are. It hath neither Ma&s;t nor Sail, and neverthele&s;s if it wanted Wind, it would pre&s;ently &s;ink to the bottom: And quite contrary to our boats, out of which they are obliged to pump the water often, into this water mu&s;t be thrown. For making of the&s;e boats then, they make fa&s;t and tye together with ropes a great many <HI>Borrachios</HI> or leathern Jugs, in a &s;quare figure but longer than broad: Ours con&s;i&s;ted of twenty <HI>Borrachios</HI> in length, and thirteen in breadth, which in all made an hundred and three&s;core. Upon the&s;e <HI>Borrachios</HI> they fa&s;ten a train, or hurdle of poles tyed together with withies, and upon that bed of poles they place four benches, which are nothing el&s;e but bundles of poles, about half a foot thick, they are &s;et at about two foot and a half di&s;|tance one from another, and are made as high; &s;o that there remains all round without, a border or &s;ide-way two or three foot broad. Afterwards they lay poles cro&s;s over from one bench to another, and upon them they load the goods and place their pa&s;&s;engers every one &s;hifting for them&s;elves a&s;well as they can upon the things they carry along with them. So the&s;e boats are about four fathom long, and three broad below; and above, (when they are loaded) about three fathom long and two broad; and they are loading and all, about five or &s;ix foot high. The&s;e <HI>Borrachios,</HI> mu&s;t be wet every half quarter of an hour, for fear they &s;hould &s;quat for want of Wind; which the boat-men do with a leathern pouch tied to the end of a pole. There is neither rudder nor &s;ail, as I &s;aid, and the whole crue con&s;i&s;ts of three Wa|termen, two of which row the boat with Oars, which are towards one of the ends, on each &s;ide one; and the&s;e Oars are no more but Poles, having &s;ins about two foot and a half long fa&s;tened to the end of them, they are made of &s;everal pieces of Cane, &s;ix or &s;even Inches long, and the third Wa|terman wets the <HI>Borrachios.</HI> They have neither &s;tem nor &s;tern, and goe any

way, but commonly &s;ide ways, quite contrary to ours: Every evening the&s;e <HI>Barrachios</HI> mu&s;t be new blow'd, which they do with the ends of reeds, and when they are cracked they mend them. The&s;e <HI>Kelecks</HI> put a &s;hoar always twice a day, that the men may do their needs. They are nece&s;&s;itated to make u&s;e of &s;uch boats, becau&s;e in the Summer-time, a &s;mall boat of Timber, cannot go upon that River, by rea&s;on of the multitude of banks.</P>
<P>Two of the&s;e <HI>Kelecks</HI> were made, and &s;o &s;oon as they were fini&s;hed I &s;ent to take a place; but the an&s;wer I had was, that they would not receive me, becau&s;e (&s;ome &s;aid) I had Wine, and others Musk with me, the &s;mell whereof would heat them too much. However, &s;ince I would by no means lo&s;e that occa&s;ion, the Reverend Father <HI>John</HI> &s;poke to &s;ome,<NOTE PLACE="marg">No Wine in a <HI>Keleck.</HI></NOTE> who promi&s;ed that I &s;hould have a place, on condition that I carried no Wine with me; for they fancy that Wine would &s;ink the <HI>Keleck:</HI> And indeed, I &s;aw &s;ome Chri&s;tians who had a great deal of credit, but not enough to embark Wine. I pre&s;ently &s;ent my Servant with my things; he &s;tayed on board to look af|ter them, and &s;ent me word, that they would not put off before the next day. I failed not next morning to go thither, but it was in vain, for (our departure being put off till night, and then till next day,) I was per&s;waded to return back; which I did the more willingly, becau&s;e I perceived it would be very incommodious to &s;pend the Night in that place. However, having heard the Soldiers of <HI>Bagdad</HI> (who were to go with us,) threaten to throw over|board the Goods of tho&s;e that offered to carry Wine, I then re&s;olved not to take any with me.</P>
<P>Next morning I came to the water-&s;ide, where at fir&s;t I had a proof of the tyranny and barbarity of the&s;e people, who putting the pa&s;&s;engers Goods on board without weighing them, reckoned them double the weight they were, for one hundred weight &s;etting down two, and doing the like for the provi&s;ions; for one mu&s;t carry every thing with him in this Voyage, wherein, (as they &s;ay,) there was neither hou&s;e nor harbour to be found. We went to the Office, and payed two <HI>Pia&s;tres</HI> for every head, and four for the hundred weight of my Goods. Then I came to keep my place, where I &s;uffered a great deal of heat, for every thing was &s;o hot there, that what|ever I touched burnt my hands, and rivers of &s;weat ran from me on all &s;ides.</P>
<P>During that time, I &s;aw an experiment of the dexterity the People of the Countrey have to cro&s;s the water without a Bridge. I perceived forty or fifty &s;he <HI>Buffles</HI> driven by a Boy &s;tark naked, who came to &s;ell the milk of them; the&s;e <HI>Buffles</HI> took the water, and fell a &s;wimming in a &s;quare body; the little Boy &s;tood upright upon the la&s;t, and &s;tepping from one to another, drove them on with a &s;tick, and that with as much force and a&s;&s;urance, as if he had been on dry Land, &s;ometimes &s;itting down upon their Buttocks: He went a&s;hoar above five hundred paces below the Town, on the other &s;ide of the Water. After Noon they demanded a <HI>Pia&s;tre</HI> more of each Per&s;on, and I was obliged to <HI>Codgia Elias</HI> that I payed a little le&s;s: But when they came to talk of putting me in the middle of the other <HI>Keleck,</HI> where I &s;hould have been &s;tifled for want of Air, I demanded back my money and goods, tel|ling them that I would &s;tay at <HI>Mo&s;ul,</HI> until the heats were over. In fine, <HI>Codgia Elias</HI> prevailed &s;o far that they left me my place; and they &s;ent other pa&s;&s;engers with their goods out of our <HI>Keleck</HI> into the other, which was le&s;s loaded. From that time they began to &s;hew me good countenance, and to a&s;&s;ure me that no body &s;hould mole&s;t me. I think that be&s;ides the credit of <HI>Codgia Elias</HI> (to whom I am much obliged for that good office, and for many more that he did me;) the Authority of <HI>Topgi Ba&s;&s;a</HI> (who&s;e Kin&s;man I gave my &s;elf out to be in the Caravan,) &s;tood me in no &s;mall &s;tead, and I had rea|&s;on to &s;ay I was, &s;ince in the Letters he gave me at <HI>Dama&s;cus</HI> he had called me his Brother.</P>

We began then to &s;et forward in good earne&s;t, and were gone but a lit|tle way, when we found an I&s;land which we left to the right hand; keeping always to the left along by the &s;hoar of <HI>Curdi&s;tan.</HI> The &s;ide of <HI>Me&s;opotamia</HI> is well &s;owed, but the <HI>Curdi&s;tan</HI> &s;hoar is barren and uncultivated; as if the cur&s;e of <HI>Nineveh</HI> were fallen upon it; neverthele&s;s in the Evening I &s;aw great flocks of &s;heep, and goats a watering.</P>
<P>The River of <HI>Tigris</HI> is more crooked and winding than any that ever I &s;aw. It maketh a great many I&s;lands, and is full of banks of &s;tone; when we pa&s;&s;ed near to any of the&s;e banks, all the <HI>Turks</HI> in <HI>Chorus</HI> called <HI>Mahomet</HI> to their a&s;&s;i&s;tance. There are a great many Birds on both &s;ides, and among&s;t others we &s;aw a flight, altogether like <HI>Francolines,</HI> &s;ave that they have an unplea&s;ant &s;mell, though the fle&s;h of them be firm and very good to eat. They were &s;o numerous, that I think a grain of &s;mall &s;hot could not have pa&s;t through without hitting &s;ome of them; and they made a Cloud above five hundred paces in length and fifty in breadth. About &s;ix a Clock we be|gan to have little hills on our right hand, which la&s;ted about two hours: And we pa&s;&s;ed near to one, out of which they have Sulphur, which they purifie and melt into Canes. This Sulphur is a very white Earth, for we were pretty near that hill, which is almo&s;t wholely of Sulphur. We &s;top|ped on the <HI>Curdi&s;tan</HI> &s;hoar two hundred paces from thence, about Sun-&s;et|ting, and re&s;ted upon the ground by the Water-&s;ide; &s;ome of the Company &s;tayed on board to guard the <HI>Kelecks;</HI> for the <HI>Arabs</HI> when they &s;ee <HI>Kelecks,</HI> many times come &s;wimming and take what they can, and then make their e&s;cape in the &s;ame manner. They have be&s;ides, the cunning (when they are &s;wimming) to put &s;ome branches of trees upon their heads, that it may not be thought they are men. The water over again&s;t the&s;e hills is no broader than the length of the <HI>Pont Marie</HI> at <HI>Paris.</HI> That Night we had a very hot Wind, which &s;ometimes brought with it cold gu&s;ts al&s;o, and I ob&s;erved they were not &s;o &s;trong as the others; I was afraid it might have been the <HI>Samiel,</HI> be|cau&s;e it blew from that hill of <HI>Sulphur.</HI></P>
<P>Next Morning being <HI>Saturday</HI> the ninth of <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> we embarked about break of day:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hills of <HI>Sul|phur.</HI></NOTE> We &s;till &s;aw on the &s;ide of <HI>Me&s;opotamia</HI> &s;ome hills of Sulphur, which we &s;melt. We met &s;everal People, Men, Women and Girls that cro&s;&s;ed the Water &s;tark naked, having a <HI>Borrachio</HI> under each Arm-pit, and their baggage on their heads, and among&s;t the re&s;t we &s;aw two Girls who &s;wam over without any help. Half an hour after Sun-ri&s;ing, we perceived on the Water-&s;ide to the left hand,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hou&s;es of <HI>A|rabs.</HI></NOTE> &s;everal of the <HI>Arabs</HI> hou&s;es, &s;quare, and about two fathom high; they were made of Poles, and covered with leaves, their Cattel were hard by, and al&s;o their Hor&s;es which are always &s;addled: The&s;e are their Summer-hou&s;es; for in the Winter-time they &s;helter them|&s;elves under their Tents of black Goats hair.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Alyhamam.</HI> Hot Baths.</NOTE>About &s;ix a Clock we &s;topt at a Village, called <HI>Alyhamam</HI> in <HI>Me&s;opotamia;</HI> there are a great many natural hot Baths there, and I make no doubt but the&s;e Waters run through Sulphur. The People of the Countrey have dugg
<PB N="57" REF="195">
great Pits in the Earth under little Domes, wherein they bath them&s;elves; for my own part, I thought it enough to wet a finger therein, and found it very hot, but not &s;calding. Sick people come there from all quarters, and are cured, but e&s;pecially Lepers. There are a great many always there from <HI>Mo&s;ul,</HI> which is but a days Journey of Caravan di&s;tant. All the Hou&s;es of this Village are by the Water-&s;ide, they are all about two fathom &s;quare, and the Walls and Roofs are onely of Canes interlaced with branches of Trees; we re&s;ted there about two hours, and then continued our Voyage. The Sun that day was &s;everal times overca&s;t with Clouds, that did us a great kindne&s;s; after Noon we &s;topt a little, to &s;tay for the other <HI>Keleck</HI> which was not come up.</P>
<P>About three a Clock we came to <HI>A&s;iguir,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">A&s;iguir.</NOTE> which is a place where the re|mains of the Foundation of a Bridge are &s;till to be &s;een, over which the Water runs with &s;o much noi&s;e, that we heard it half an hour before we came to the place. When we were got there, we went a &s;hoar on the left hand, be|cau&s;e there is onely a &s;mall pa&s;&s;age near Land for the <HI>Kelecks;</HI> and in the Summer-time it is &s;o &s;hallow, that many times they are forced to keep in the middle and go over &s;tones that ri&s;e to the brim of the Water, and make a kind of ca&s;cade or fall. We all took our Arms, to defend us again&s;t the Lions, which are there in great Numbers among&s;t little Coppi&s;es; however we &s;aw none. When the <HI>Keleck</HI> had pa&s;&s;ed near the &s;hoar the current carried it into the middle of the River; &s;o that it could not &s;top till it came to an I&s;land which is about fifty paces from the main Land, and thither we went to it up to the knees in water. A little after, we had a great many hills to the right hand; and on the fir&s;t of them there is &s;till &s;ome remains of a Ca&s;tle, called <HI>Top-Calai,</HI> that's to &s;ay the Ca&s;tle of Cannons;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Top-Calai.</NOTE> they &s;ay it was built by <HI>Nim|rod,</HI> as well as that Bridge, which he had built for his convenience in going to his Mi&s;tre&s;s whom he kept on the other &s;ide.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides that, we &s;aw a great many other hills of Sulphur; and one among&s;t the re&s;t very high, the Sulphur whereof appeared very yellow, and &s;melt &s;trong. About half an hour after, we &s;aw the end of the&s;e Mountains, and had others on the left hand covered over with Trees. A quarter of an hour after, we &s;aw on the left hand,<NOTE PLACE="marg">River of <HI>Zarb.</HI></NOTE> the place where the River of <HI>Zarb</HI> falls into the <HI>Tigris:</HI> It's a great River, more than half as broad as the <HI>Tigris,</HI> very rapid, and the Water thereof is whiti&s;h and cold: They &s;ay that it comes very far off from the Mountains of <HI>Curdi&s;tan,</HI> and is onely Snow-water. On the &s;ame &s;ide, about a <HI>French</HI> League up in the Countrey there is a hill by it &s;elf, on which are the Ruines of a Ca&s;tle, called <HI>Kchaf.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Kchaf.</NOTE> Having pa&s;&s;ed this place (which looks like a little Sea,) we had con&s;tantly to the left hand Woods full of Lions, Boars and other wild Bea&s;ts. We rowed on till the Sun was &s;etting not knowing where to lye, becau&s;e we dur&s;t not go a &s;hoar on the &s;ide of the Woods for fear of Lions; and on the &s;ide of <HI>Me&s;opotamia</HI> we &s;aw <HI>Arabs;</HI> at length ju&s;t at Sun-&s;etting, we &s;topt near Woods, which are all of Tamarisk and Liquourice, and &s;et a guard both again&s;t Men and Bea&s;ts. From <HI>Mo&s;ul</HI> to this place, they reckon it two days Journey and a half by Caravan.</P>
<P>After midnight three Robbers &s;tark naked approached, but finding them|&s;elves di&s;covered, they dived into the water, and di&s;appeared; neverthele&s;s this gave us a great allarm, for they who &s;aw them, ran in all ha&s;te to the <HI>Keleck,</HI> crying out like men in extreme danger; and the re&s;t not knowing what the matter was, and thinking that they had a Lion at their heels, threw them&s;elves de&s;perately into the <HI>Keleck,</HI> whil&s;t tho&s;e that were a&s;leep on board, awaking at the noi&s;e, and imagining there was a Lion in the <HI>Keleck,</HI> endeavoured to get out: In &s;hort, &s;o great was the di&s;order, that no man knowing what he did, it is a wonder we did not kill one another.</P>
<P><HI>Sunday</HI> the tenth of <HI>April,</HI> about break of day, we put forward again, and half an hour after, pa&s;t by the foot of a Hill to the left hand, on which there is a <HI>Mo&s;que,</HI> with a Building like to a little Ca&s;tle, called <HI>Sultan-Abdullah:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Sultan-Abdul|lah.</NOTE> heretofore it was inhabited by <HI>Dervi&s;hes,</HI> and (at pre&s;ent) &s;erves for a retreat to <HI>Arabian</HI> Robbers. We &s;aw about a &s;core of them on the water-&s;ide, with their Hor&s;es and Lances, who &s;ent three of their company towards us. The&s;e
<PB N="58" REF="196">
Blades, having &s;tript them&s;elves naked, came &s;wimming, and asked Bread of us; they had it, and &s;o returned, carrying each two Loaves, one upon their head, and the other in one hand, which they held out of the water, &s;wim|ming only with the other hand. We had &s;till Woods to our left, and by in|tervals &s;ome Hills, and &s;hortly after we had Woods al&s;o to the right hand. In &s;everal places on the &s;ame &s;ide we &s;aw a great many of the Summer-hou&s;es of the <HI>Arabs,</HI> but no body in them.</P>
<P>Half an hour after five in the evening, we &s;aw upon a little Hill on the &s;ame hand the ruins of a Ca&s;tle called <HI>Toprac-Cala&s;i.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Toprac-Cala&s;i.</NOTE> There were &s;ome Hou&s;es of <HI>Arabs</HI> there; and the other <HI>Keleck</HI> having &s;topt a few minutes near Land, they &s;tole an <HI>Abe</HI> of Cloth, which is a kind of a Ve&s;t, and no body perceived it till they were gone. The&s;e <HI>Arabs</HI> &s;ow Millet thereabouts, of which they make their Bread, eating no other.</P>
<P>We &s;topt that day in the morning and at noon to do the needs of Nature, as it was our cu&s;tom, and then continued our way, having always Hills on the right hand; and about Sun-&s;etting we went a-&s;hoar at a place on the left hand, where there is abundance of Lions, and where one mu&s;t have a &s;pecial care of <HI>Arabs;</HI> for &s;ome time ago the <HI>Arabs</HI> robbed a <HI>Keleck</HI> in that very place, having on board almo&s;t four&s;core people, whom they killed, and then over-&s;et the <HI>Keleck,</HI> that it might be thought it over-&s;et of it &s;elf. Hardly were we ar|rived, when three <HI>Arabs</HI> came &s;wimming over to us from the other &s;ide; we gave them Bread, and &s;o &s;et them going.</P>
<P>We parted next morning (<HI>Monday</HI> the eleventh of <HI>Augu&s;t</HI>) at break of day, and had Hills &s;till on our right hand. About eight a clock we pa&s;&s;ed near one of the&s;e Hills, on which the people of the Countrey &s;ay there is a Ca&s;tle named <HI>Mekhoul-Calaai,</HI> by the name of a <HI>Franck</HI> who built it. About nine a clock we &s;aw the ends of the&s;e Hills.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Liquorice-water.</NOTE> The Liquorice which I found by the way when we went a-&s;hoar, was very u&s;eful to me; for I infu&s;ed it in the water which I drank, and that plea&s;ed me better than common water, which not only made me &s;weat exce&s;&s;ively (for I voided by the pores as much as I drank,) but al&s;o it rai&s;ed on me &s;everal Bli&s;ters, that pricked me like &s;o many needles as often as I drank or &s;ate down: whereas when I drank Liquorice-water,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sumack.</NOTE> I felt none of the&s;e inconveniences. I had be&s;ides <HI>Sumack,</HI> which is almo&s;t like Hemp-&s;eed, wherewith I made another &s;ort of Drink, by putting a little of that grain into water, and after pounding it; that yiel|ded me a very red Water, but very cooling and whol&s;om; and if a little Salt be added to it, it makes it much plea&s;anter. They u&s;e a great deal of <HI>Sumack;</HI> and when it is beat and put into Broth, it is very whol&s;om, and a good re|medy again&s;t the Bloody-Flux.</P>
<P>They &s;uffer no man to make a Tent upon the&s;e <HI>Kelecks</HI> to keep out the Sun; nay they would not &s;uffer me to hold a bough of a Tree over my head, becau&s;e of the wind, which might over-&s;et the <HI>Keleck:</HI> but I found a way to defend my &s;elf again&s;t the heat of the Sun, by lying half at length, &s;o that my head was a little higher, almo&s;t as if I had been &s;itting. In this po|&s;ture I fa&s;tened one end of my <HI>Abe</HI> behind my head, and covered my &s;elf with the re&s;t in manner of a Tent, by means of three &s;ticks, of which one that I held between my Legs upheld it in the middle, and was like the main Pile; the other two &s;upported it on the two &s;ides. In this manner I had a pretty convenient &s;hade, and the wind ever almo&s;t on one &s;ide or other: but notwith&s;tanding all my circum&s;pection, I &s;uffered great heats, e&s;pecially &s;ome days, when there was not a breath of wind. About noon, the Hills began again, and the&s;e Mountains run along as far as the <HI>Indies;</HI> they call them <HI>Dgebel Hemrin:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Dgebel Hem|rin. Montes Corda|ci. Gioubbar Ca|lai. Altun Daghi.</NOTE> I believe they are the Mountains called <HI>Cordaci</HI> by <HI>Quintus Curtius</HI> in his fourth Book and tenth Chapter.</P>
<P>Towards two of the clock we pa&s;&s;ed near to a Ca&s;tle which is in <HI>Me&s;opo|tamia,</HI> called <HI>Gioubbar Calai;</HI> and &s;ome time after, we &s;aw a little Hill to the left hand, called <HI>Altun Daghi,</HI> that's to &s;ay, <HI>the Hill of Gold,</HI> becau&s;e the <HI>Arabs</HI> digging in it here and there find a little Gold. About four a clock we pa&s;&s;ed that place, where they that go down the <HI>Tygris</HI> (as we did,) begin to have the Mounts <HI>Hebrin</HI> to the left, which till that place they have always had to the right, and on the &s;ide of <HI>Me&s;opotamia.</HI> It is the tradition, that the River
<PB N="59" REF="196">
heretofore divided them, and that they go by <HI>I&s;pahan,</HI> and reach as far as the <HI>Indies;</HI> and in that Countrey they affirm, that the&s;e Hills, (which are of a white Rock,) encompa&s;s all the World. At Sun-&s;etting we went a-&s;hoar on the &s;ide of <HI>Me&s;opotamia,</HI> over again&s;t <HI>Kizil-Han;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Kizil-Han.</NOTE> which is a <HI>Han</HI> not far from it, and the fifth Lodging of the Caravans that come from <HI>Mo&s;ul.</HI></P>
<P>We did not take our Lodging on the other &s;ide as the nights before, becau&s;e of the Lions that are there, and are to be &s;een in Flocks like Sheep. We kept good Guard, becau&s;e our &s;tation was pretty near to the Hou&s;es of &s;ome <HI>Arabs;</HI> be&s;ides, there were &s;ome Lions al&s;o on that &s;ide. Among&s;t the re&s;t, there is one that is in great reputation among the people of the Countrey: he is called, <HI>the Lion of Kizil-Han,</HI> and is &s;aid to be as big as an A&s;s,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Lion of great bigne&s;s.</NOTE> and of extraordinary &s;trength; who never fails to take a man of every Caravan, and it was very honourable for ours that we paid him not that Tribute. They add, that he commonly &s;ets upon tho&s;e who &s;traggle in the rear; and (that it may not be thought that it's for want of courage, but only out of cunning, that he does &s;o,) they &s;ay he is &s;o bold, that if he &s;ee no more but two or three men, he comes confidently up to them, and taking one of them in his Claws, lays him upon his Back, and carries him away. Some Caravani&s;ts told me a great many Tales upon that &s;ubject, which I &s;hall give as cheap as I had them.</P>
<P>They told me very &s;eriou&s;ly, that the Lion never &s;ets upon a man but when he is very hungry, and that he feeds upon him backwards, beginning always at his Buttocks, becau&s;e he is afraid of the face of a man. That when he takes a Camel or a Buffle, he lays him on his Back, and ea&s;ily carries that Load; but that he cannot do &s;o with an He-Buffle nor a Sheep; for he dares not &s;et upon an He-Buffle, becau&s;e he would certainly be killed by him: As to a Sheep, that he can very well take and kill it, though he cannot carry it, but is obliged to drag it; and the rea&s;on is, becau&s;e heretofore the Lion ta|king a Buffle or Camel, &s;aid, <HI>I carry it in the &s;trength of God,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">A Fable of the Lion.</NOTE> knowing that it was above his power; but having found a Sheep, he &s;aid, <HI>I'll carry this well enough by my own &s;trength;</HI> and therefore God puni&s;hed his Pre&s;umption, by di&s;abling him to carry it. This they have got from the Fables of damned <HI>Calilve.</HI> They affirm moreover, that the Lion under&s;tands what a man &s;ays, and weeps when a man &s;peaks. The <HI>Arabs</HI> are not afraid of Lions,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Arabs</HI> are not afraid of Lions.</NOTE> and provided an <HI>Arab</HI> have but a &s;tick in his hand, he'll pur&s;ue a Lion, and kill him if he can catch him.</P>
<P>This evening about nine a clock one of the men of our <HI>Keleck,</HI> with a Hook took a great Fi&s;h; it was above five foot long,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Fi&s;h as big as a man.</NOTE> and though it was as big as a man, yet he told me it was a young one, and that commonly they are much bigger. The Head of it was above a foot long; the Eyes four inches above the Jaws, round, and as big as a bra&s;s farthing; the mouth of it was round, and being opened as wide as the mouth of a Cannon, &s;o that my head could ea&s;ily have gone into it; about the mouth on the out-&s;ide, it had four white long Beards of Fle&s;h, as big as ones little finger; it was all over covered with &s;cales like to tho&s;e of a Carp; it lived long out of the water, died when they opened the Belly to skin it, and was a Female: the fle&s;h of it was white, ta&s;ted much like a Tunny, and was as &s;oft and loo&s;e as Flax.</P>
<P>We embarked again next day (the twelfth of <HI>Augu&s;t</HI>) in the dawning, and about two a clock after noon came to <HI>Tikri,</HI> which is in <HI>Me&s;opotamia,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Tikri.</NOTE> and the &s;ixth Lodging of the Caravans from <HI>Mo&s;ul:</HI> there we &s;pent the re&s;t of the day. I endeavoured twice to go thither, but could not, becau&s;e in ten or twelve places there is danger of breaking ones neck; &s;o that I re&s;ted &s;atisfied to &s;ee the Hou&s;es which are to the water-&s;ide, and are well enough built for that Countrey, being all of rough Stone. I under&s;tood that heretofore it had been a great Town, but at pre&s;ent it is no more but ruins, and hardly to be reckoned a good Village; and indeed, we had much ado to find Bread in it, and to have a little Meat it behoved me to buy a whole Sheep. It is built upon a very high Rock, becau&s;e of the overflowings of the <HI>Tygris</HI> which happens in the Spring; for then it &s;wells &s;o con&s;iderably, that it &s;eems to be a little Sea, and is deeper than in Summer by above four or five Pikes length,
<PB N="60" REF="197">
as I might ea&s;ily ob&s;erve by the marks that remain on the Hills. We had no Lions to be afraid of in that place, but Robbers we had.</P>
<P><HI>Wedne&s;day</HI> the thirteenth of <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> we parted from thence, about break of day,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Imam-Mu|hammeddour.</NOTE> and about eight a clock &s;aw to the left hand a Village called <HI>Imam-Mu|hammeddour,</HI> from the name of a Mo&s;que, where they pay great Devotion: all that I could ob&s;erve in pa&s;&s;ing, was a &s;quare Minaret that &s;pires into a Pyramid. About noon we &s;aw many for&s;aken hou&s;es, &s;ome ruinous, and others not; and that during the &s;pace of above two hours way, but at di&s;tan|ces one from another;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Eski-Bagdad.</NOTE> they call that <HI>Eski-Bagdad, the ancient Bagdad.</HI> About two in the afternoon we &s;topt on the left hand, becau&s;e the wind was high. At that time &s;ome of our company having gone a-&s;hoar to &s;it under a Tree, they had hardly made one &s;tep, when they returned with all &s;peed, becau&s;e they found that the wind was <HI>Samiel,</HI> and told me that they felt the Air as it had been fire. We &s;taied there about two hours, and then went on our way; but the wind &s;till continuing, and being apprehen&s;ive that it might force us upon &s;ome Bank, half an hour after, we put a-&s;hoar on the &s;ame &s;ide. We were pre&s;ently vi&s;ited by the <HI>Arabs,</HI> who told us, that in the morning a Lion had carried away one of their Buffles; I asked one of them, if he run away when he met a Lion: <HI>God forbid,</HI> (an&s;wered he;) <HI>a Man &s;hould never flie from a Lion, &s;eeing if a Lion perceive that he is re&s;olute, it will be &s;ure to run fir&s;t.</HI> We kept Guard all night long again&s;t the <HI>Arabs</HI> and Lions, who&s;e roa|rings we heard every minute, as well as the noi&s;e of the <HI>Karacoulacks,</HI> the yelping of the <HI>Chakales,</HI> and the barking of the <HI>Arabs</HI> Dogs.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Karacoulacks.</NOTE>The <HI>Karacoulacks</HI> are Bea&s;ts &s;omewhat bigger than Cats, and much of the &s;ame &s;hape; they have long black ears, almo&s;t half a foot long; and from thence they have their name, which &s;ignifies <HI>black-ear.</HI> They are the <HI>Chiaoux</HI> of the Lions, (as the people of the Countrey &s;ay) for they go &s;ome &s;teps before them, and are, as it were, their guides to lead them unto tho&s;e places where there is Prey, and have a &s;hare for their reward. When that Bea&s;t calls the Lion, it &s;eems to be the voice of a Man calling another, though the voice of this be a little &s;hriller: I was told that the <HI>Karacoulack</HI> and the <HI>Leo|pard</HI> were one and the &s;ame thing.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Chakales.</HI> The Author was in that mi|&s;take in his fir&s;t Travels.</NOTE> The <HI>Chakales</HI> are as big as Foxes, and have &s;omething of a Fox, and &s;omething of a Wolf, but are not Mongrels begot of them, as many have &s;aid.</P>
<P>We were obliged then to keep Guard both towards the Land and Water, as well again&s;t Men as Bea&s;ts. Several told &s;tories how that many Lions had come to Caravans and carried away men, no body &s;carcely perceiving it; becau&s;e when a Lion &s;wims, he hides all his Body under water except the No&s;e, &s;o that he comes on &s;o &s;oftly, that he is not heard; and when he is a-&s;hoar he &s;natches a man, and jumping into the water with him, carries him over to the other &s;ide. Whenever we heard a Fi&s;h &s;tir in the water, we took the allarm, and that obliged us to make a fire, and &s;hoot off &s;everal Mu&s;|quets, becau&s;e they &s;ay the Lion is afraid of fire. About midnight we heard the voice of a <HI>Chakale</HI> near to us, but when we &s;pake it was &s;ilent; and we all thought it was an <HI>Arab</HI> who had counterfeited the noi&s;e of a <HI>Chakale,</HI> that &s;eeing him afterwards come creeping upon all four, we might not have been allarmed, for they have the cunning to do &s;o. A little before day a real <HI>Cha|kale</HI> came within Mu&s;quet-&s;hot of us, but finding it &s;elf di&s;covered, fled. The&s;e <HI>Chakales</HI> are very thieving Bea&s;ts, not only of what is fit for eating, but of any thing el&s;e they find, carrying away even Turbans &s;ometimes; they howl almo&s;t like Dogs, one making the Treble, another the Ba&s;&s;e, and a third the Counter-Tenor; and &s;o &s;oon as one cries, the re&s;t cry al&s;o, &s;o that all together they make a noi&s;e which may truly be called Dogs Mu&s;ick.</P>

We began then to make the be&s;t of our way by night as well as by day, becau&s;e there are no more Banks, and the River is very broad, but al&s;o &s;o &s;till, that it can hardly be di&s;cerned which way it runs.

<P>Next day, being <HI>Friday</HI> the fifteenth of <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> we &s;aw about noon many Boats near the &s;hoar, which have Ma&s;ts like <HI>Saicks,</HI> and &s;erve to carry Corn to <HI>Bagdad</HI> from the neighbouring Villages.

At that place we were not altogether &s;afe from Lions, &s;eeing the people of the Countrey told us, that they come often into their Gardens, and that one morning a Lion came to the very Suburbs of <HI>Bagdad</HI> that lies on the De&s;art-&s;ide, where it &s;eized a man who had ri&s;en too early.

<P><HI>BAGDAD</HI> is a long Town lying upon the River-&s;ide;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Bagdad.</NOTE> the fir&s;t thing one &s;ees in arriving, is the Ca&s;tle on the &s;ide of the River to the left hand, which on the out&s;ide appears to be pretty &s;trong: It is built of lovely white Stone, but I was told that there was nothing within but Huts. Below that Ca&s;tle, upon the water-&s;ide al&s;o, &s;tands the Serraglio of the Ba&s;ha, which hath fair <HI>Kiochks,</HI> from whence they have a good Pro&s;pect, and fre&s;h Air.
<PB N="62" REF="198">
Next you find a Bridge of about forty Boats, on which they cro&s;s into <HI>Me&s;opo|tamia,</HI> where there is a Town al&s;o, or rather a Suburbs of <HI>Bagdad;</HI> but the Hou&s;es of it are ill built. Every night they undo that Bridge.</P>
<P>It requires at lea&s;t two hours to make the round of <HI>Bagdad,</HI> which is not very &s;trong on the Land-&s;ide. There are fair <HI>Bazars</HI> and lovely <HI>Bagnio's</HI> in this Town, built by the <HI>Per&s;ians;</HI> and generally all that is goodly in it hath been built by them. It is but ill peopled, con&s;idering the bigne&s;s of the place, and indeed, it is not compactly built, for there are a great many empty places in it, where there's not one Soul to be found; and, except the <HI>Bazars,</HI> (where there is always a great confluence of people,) the re&s;t looks like a De&s;art. The Soldiers here are very licentious, and commit all imaginable In&s;olencies, their Officers not daring &s;carcely to puni&s;h them. Some weeks before I arri|ved there, they had put the Ba&s;ha to death by poy&s;on, becau&s;e of his Ty|rannies, and, (it was &s;aid,) the Aga had a &s;hare in it, though he kept not his bed, but was in a langui&s;hing condition. Be&s;ides the Turki&s;h Militia, there are a great many Chri&s;tians in the Grand-Signior's Pay, to fight again&s;t the <HI>Arabs,</HI> when they are commanded.</P>
<P>It is very hot in this Town, and that's the rea&s;on the people &s;leep upon the Terra&s;&s;es.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The degrees of heat at <HI>Bag|dad.</HI></NOTE> The eighteenth of <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> at noon, the heat was at the thirty &s;e|venth degree by my <HI>Thermometre,</HI> and neverthele&s;s it blew a cool breeze of wind.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The water of the <HI>Tygris.</HI></NOTE>Oppo&s;ite to <HI>Bagdad</HI> the <HI>Tygris</HI> is very broad, the water whereof they draw, and put into great Jars of Clay that is not burnt, and through the&s;e Jars the water tran&s;pires and percolates into an earthen Ve&s;&s;el under|neath, in the &s;ame manner as at <HI>Aleppo;</HI> they call this River <HI>Chav-Bagdad,</HI> that's to &s;ay, <HI>the River of Bagdad;</HI> but wanting skill to make Water-mills upon it, they are forced to grind all their Corn with Hor&s;e-mills or Hand-mills.</P>

<P>We mu&s;t here take notice of a con&s;iderable mi&s;take in all Maps, where <HI>Bag|dad</HI> is placed a great way below the confluent of the two Rivers of <HI>Euphrates</HI> and <HI>Tygris,</HI> though it be certain that they joyn not but at ten or twelve days Journey below <HI>Bagdad,</HI> in the furthermo&s;t part of <HI>Dgezri:</HI> It is true, that in the Winter-time, when the&s;e two Rivers break out, they joyn at <HI>Bagdad,</HI> but that happens not every year. About eight or nine days Journey below <HI>Bagdad,</HI> there is a Canal made, which goes from <HI>Euphrates</HI> to the <HI>Tygris.</HI></P>

<P>That Caravan con&s;i&s;ted of three&s;core and ten or four&s;core men, all bold and fearle&s;s Blades, for they had but one Pi&s;tol and &s;ome few Shables among&s;t them all; and to &s;hew that it was not the number they relied upon, they commonly divided, and marched &s;eparately at &s;ome di&s;tance from one ano|ther,
<PB N="63" REF="198">
without fear of Robbers, and they were almo&s;t all <HI>Per&s;ians.</HI> They were as little apprehen&s;ive too of the weather as of dangers, for among&s;t them all they had no more but two or three little &s;orry Tents, covered with &s;ome pieces of old Carpets: For my own part, (&s;ince I was not &s;o brave,) I had a good Pa|villion to cover me; and among&s;t three of us we had twelve &s;hot that we could fire without re-charging.</P>
<P>We parted from <HI>Bagdad, Wedne&s;day</HI> the twentieth of <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Departure from <HI>Bagdad.</HI></NOTE> about five a clock in the evening, and joyned the Caravan, which was encamped a|mong&s;t &s;mall Trees without the Gate called <HI>Caranlu-Capi,</HI> that looks to the Ea&s;t.

<P>The Caravan marched next day, being <HI>Thur&s;day</HI> the one and twentieth of <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> a little after midnight: We pre&s;ently entered the De&s;art, marching Northward, in a great Plain of very &s;mooth whiti&s;h ground, glazed over with Salt, where grows nothing but wild <HI>Caper-&s;hrubs,</HI> and <HI>Land-Caltrops.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Wild</HI> Caper Shrubs.

<P>About nine a clock in the morning we encamped by the &s;ide of the <HI>Tygris,</HI> &s;ome miles below <HI>Yenghidge,</HI> near a Village called <HI>Locmam-Hakin,</HI> or <HI>Locman the wi&s;e;</HI> there we &s;taid all day, and in the evening we heard &s;everal companies of <HI>Chakales,</HI> which entertained us with their Mu&s;ick.

On the other &s;ide we paid each Hor&s;e-man an <HI>Aba&s;&s;i,</HI> to a <HI>Turk</HI> who receives that Toll, and all pay the &s;ame, of what&s;oever Religion they be. This River is at lea&s;t as broad as two third parts of the <HI>Seine,</HI> and at <HI>Ba&s;&s;ora</HI> it falls into the <HI>Tygris.</HI> Having cro&s;&s;ed it, we went and lodged in a great Village called <HI>Aacoube,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Aacoube.</NOTE> under Palm-Trees which are there in great quantity.</P>
<P>Next morning by break of day we began to march; our Company would not &s;et out &s;ooner, becau&s;e they knew not the ways. We continued our way Ea&s;twards; and about &s;even a clock &s;aw to the left hand a Mo&s;que, which is a place of Pilgrimage. A quarter of an hour after, we pa&s;t through the ruins of a de&s;olated Village, and then over a Bridge of one Arch, under which the Channel was very dry. About nine of the clock we cro&s;&s;ed a Village called <HI>Harounia,</HI> and encamped near the Gardens, which are many.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Harounia.</NOTE> We made our Journey the &s;horter, for fear of the heat. We were obliged to keep Guard all night, becau&s;e of Thieves and Robbers, yet we heard nothing but <HI>Chakales.</HI></P>
<P>We parted from that place on <HI>Sunday</HI> the four and twentieth of <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> about two a clock in the morning, keeping on &s;till Ea&s;tward. About three a clock we pa&s;&s;ed near to a Village called <HI>Adgia,</HI> and about half an hour after &s;ix, clo&s;e by another called <HI>Imam-Esker,</HI> where there is a Bridge,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Imam-Esker.</NOTE> upon which they exacted for every Hor&s;e, Mule or A&s;s, an <HI>Aha&s;&s;i</HI> and a <HI>Mahmoudi,</HI> which is a&s;much as a <HI>Chai,</HI> and a <HI>Para,</HI> though the Bridge it &s;elf never co&s;t &s;ix <HI>Aha&s;&s;is,</HI> for it is onely made of two beams of Palm-tree, that reach from &s;ide to &s;ide, with &s;ome planks a-cro&s;s, and half a foot of Earth over them; the River that runs underneath being but a Brook no bigger than the River of <HI>Gobe|lines</HI> at <HI>Paris.</HI> They call that due, the toll of bridles. We re&s;ted beyond the Bridge, becau&s;e not onely our People were afraid of the heat; but they were be&s;ides informed that &s;ome <HI>Arabs</HI> waited for us on the way, and there|fore they held a Council to re&s;olve what was fitte&s;t to be done: Though they had no certainty of this, yet they were &s;trangely &s;tartled at it, and the fear proceeded from &s;ome among&s;t them, who knowing that we were to march through a narrow pa&s;&s;age, imagined that an hundred <HI>Arabs</HI> expected us there; and yet they reduced this number afterwards to fifteen. It was to no purpo&s;e to upbraid them with Cowardi&s;e, telling them that let them be as many as they plea&s;ed we feared them not. Though this re&s;olution gave them &s;ome a&s;&s;u|rance, yet they u&s;ed their credit to make us &s;tay for &s;ome <HI>Jani&s;&s;aries,</HI> who
<PB N="64" REF="199">
who were going to <HI>Mendeli;</HI> and in ca&s;e they would not accompany them, they re&s;olved to take four Troopers at the Village. They &s;ent one of their number to acquaint us with their re&s;olution, and civilly to entreat us to con|tribute &s;omewhat to the pay of the&s;e Troopers: At fir&s;t we refu&s;ed it, yet gave them &s;ome <HI>Chais</HI> after, with a Prote&s;tation that it was not for any fear we were in, and that we &s;hould not be concerned though there were an hundred <HI>Arabs</HI> of them, but that what we did was onely in a complai&s;ance, not thinking the&s;e Troopers to be any ways nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>We parted the &s;ame day about eleven a Clock at Night, attended by fif|teen <HI>Jani&s;&s;aries</HI> armed &s;ome with Muskets, and &s;ome with Arrows and all marching in good order, and at a good rate too, for there was not one of them but was &s;ufficiently afraid, and we continued our march Ea&s;twards. <HI>Munday</HI> the five and twentieth of <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> about two of the Clock in the Mor|ning, we met a Caravan of about four&s;core or a hundred in company, &s;ome mounted on Hor&s;es,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Cunes</HI> upon Camels.</NOTE> Mules or A&s;&s;es, and the re&s;t in great <HI>Cunes,</HI> well cove|red over Arch-ways, each Camel carrying two of them, and in that compa|ny I &s;aw &s;even or eight of the&s;e Machines. This Caravan came from <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> and was no better armed than ours, which a little le&s;&s;ened our Peoples fear, who before that, made frequent di&s;charges of two ru&s;ty Pi&s;tols, which was all the Artillery they had.</P>
<P>About break of day we pa&s;&s;ed that dangerous pa&s;s they talked of: It was a way &s;omewhat narrow, near to a little Water, but it &s;eemed to me to be no more dangerous than the re&s;t of the Road. We met by the way &s;everal Men and Women, &s;ome on A&s;&s;es, others on foot; &s;ome in company and o|thers not; which made me think that it was a very good &s;afe Road: For from <HI>Bagdad</HI> to <HI>Mendeli,</HI> the way is always full and as &s;mooth as a Looking-gla&s;s; but I take it to be very bad in Winter, for there are pieces of ground all chincked and cracked, by the heat, which yielded a little under our Hor|&s;es feet, and that made me conclude that in another &s;ea&s;on it would be very deep. About &s;ix a Clock in the Morning we &s;aw to the right, a Village cal|led <HI>Nebitarana,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Nebitarana.</NOTE> and half an hour after &s;even, we arrived at <HI>Mendeli,</HI> near to which we encamped.</P>

There we re&s;ted all the next day being <HI>Tue&s;day</HI> the &s;ix and twentieth of <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> and payed an <HI>Aba&s;&s;i</HI> for every load: The &s;ame day a Caravan arrived at <HI>Mendeli,</HI> which came from <HI>I&s;pahan</HI> and was going to <HI>Bagdad;</HI> it was no bigger than ours and had no fire-Arms; yet there were <HI>Arabs</HI> at <HI>Mendeli</HI> who looked &s;u&s;piciou&s;ly: And I was told that a <HI>Turk</HI> having asked them, why they had done nothing to us, they had made an&s;wer, that it was becau&s;e we had nothing but Leather, which they did not much care for; they u&s;ed this <HI>Rodomontado,</HI> becau&s;e they &s;aw &s;ome Hor&s;es in our Caravan loaded with <HI>Buffles</HI> skins; in the Night-time we heard &s;everal <HI>Chakales.</HI></P>

About ten of the Clock in the Morning we had a Rancounter, which we little thought of.</P>
<P>As I pa&s;&s;ed within a few &s;teps of three Huts made of Canes; I &s;aw two Men in <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Habit, of whom he that &s;eemed to be the chief had a clo&s;e bo|died Coat of Silk-&s;tuff with large Flowers of Gold: They came towards us whil&s;t I minded nothing, and &s;poke to me though I did not heed it: In the mean time finding that I li&s;tened not to what they &s;aid to me, one of them with a hooked &s;tick, took hold of my Hor&s;es bridle and &s;topt him; which made me pull out a Pi&s;tol, and to con&s;ider the Men more attentively. I perceived that they made no &s;hew of offering any violence, though they were armed each of them with a Quiver full of Arrows, a Bow, an Ax by their &s;ide and a Cymetre; and indeed, it had not been their be&s;t cour&s;e, I and they who followed me having our fire-Arms all in readine&s;s, which made me a little wonder at the boldne&s;s of the Men.

not proceed again&s;t their Will,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Rahdars</HI> guards of the Road.</NOTE> though we might have done it.

<P>They &s;top all that are not in Caravan, if they know them not.

We might have ea&s;ily forced them, (as I have &s;aid;) but it would not have lookt well to have committed violence upon our fir&s;t entry into a Countrey; for at this place begin the Territories of the King of <HI>Per&s;ia.</HI> At length, (by the Council of the <HI>Kervan-Ba&s;ha</HI>) we followed them to their Huts, where they &s;pread a Carpet, on which we &s;ate down together like good friends. In the mean time they unloaded our goods, and &s;everal of their men came into the place where we were. Their Ma&s;ter bid us lay by our Swords; which we freely did, and he drew them one after another. We had &s;ome thoughts that he intended to be revenged for our offering to fire upon him; but after he had look'd upon them, be put them up again: He told us a &s;econd time that his office was to &s;uffer no man to enter into <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> unle&s;s he were known, lea&s;t &s;ome might come and make their e&s;cape there, when they had committed Villanies el&s;ewhere; I made him an&s;wer that many <HI>Franks</HI> had pa&s;t that way before, without being &s;topt, but he a&s;&s;ured me of the contrary; and indeed, I believe that the ordinary way is &s;omewhat more towards the North, than <HI>Mendeli.</HI> In &s;hort, he prote&s;ted that he would not let us goe, unle&s;s tho&s;e of the Caravan would an&s;wer for us, wherefore we &s;ent our Mu|letor with one of the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> to the Camp, which was half an hours walk from thence. In the mean time, that man complained &s;everal times to my Servant, that we &s;hould have offered to fire at him, and give him bad lan|guage as if he had been a Rogue: Neverthele&s;s, he civilly ordered our Dinner to be brought which con&s;i&s;ted of a great Bowl full of Bread; two Bowls of &s;ower Milk, two plates of new made Butter; and a wooden Di&s;h wherein there were about two Eggs prepared with a &s;auce, which I think can hardly be found in any Book of Cookery; and that was for about a dozen of men. We fed a little, and drank Water in wooden Cups. Then the man mu&s;t needs &s;ee our Trunks, he handled the watches of <HI>Mon&s;ieur Jacob</HI> one after another; I opened al&s;o my <HI>Sepet;</HI> but finding that he had a mind to &s;ee all things onely out of Curio&s;ity, and to make <HI>Tama&s;cha</HI> as he called it, I told him that he had no right of demanding cu&s;tom, nor by con&s;equence of view|ing our goods, that it required much time to do them up again, and that therefore he might undoe what he thought fit, and do them up again him|&s;elf; but that if any thing were lo&s;t, he &s;hould be made accountable for it, and that made him &s;uffer me to make all fa&s;t again. Afterwards the man whom we &s;ent with our Muletor arrived, and brought him a Paper &s;igned by &s;everal of our Caravan, who vouched for us, and who indeed threatned, that if the lea&s;t wrong were done unto us, they would complain of it, and that if we went and complained to the <HI>Chan,</HI> it would certainly bring them into trouble. Immediately they di&s;mi&s;&s;ed us, and we turned to the Caravan.</P>

<P>We were now free from keeping guard in the Night-time, for there are no Robbers there, and we &s;aw no more Palm-trees after we were gone thence. We parted from that place next day, being <HI>Thur&s;day</HI> the eight and twentieth of <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> about one of the Clock in the Morning, and pre&s;ently after we were at a lo&s;s, no body knowing the way, which we &s;ought for up and down; it being very dark and the sky overca&s;t with Clouds, that now and then &s;ent us &s;ome drops of Rain. Many of our loads happened to fall al&s;o; &s;o that we lo&s;t above half an hours time. At length we made a &s;hift to cro&s;s a little Ditch of Runningwater, and then &s;crambled up a very high and &s;teep hill, doing nothing all the re&s;t of the Night but climb up and down, go backwards and forwards, looking for the way which we had lo&s;t. Once we pa&s;&s;ed the River <HI>Rogoura,</HI> or <HI>Roudhhouna</HI> which runs among&s;t the&s;e hills with a great noi&s;e becau&s;e of the Stones its Channel is full of. About five of the Clock in the Morning we &s;aw the Ruines of a very high Bridge, with two Stories of Arches, one over another; it was built of rough Stone, but one half of it onely remains, and that made me think that this Water is &s;ometimes apt to overflow very much. A little after, we pa&s;&s;ed it a &s;econd time, and met a Caravan coming from <HI>Hamadan,</HI> and going to <HI>Bagdad.</HI> We continued our way upwards along the &s;ide of that River; and about &s;ix a Clock in the Morning, &s;aw a little Village of <HI>Curds,</HI> (that's to &s;ay) &s;ome Huts made of Canes and Leaves of Trees; and then we cro&s;&s;ed that River again &s;even or eight times, which at the place where we pa&s;t it la&s;t, to wit towards the head, is &s;even or eight fathom over.

<P>After we had pitched our Tent we &s;aw a Caravan that came from <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> and was going to <HI>Bagdad</HI> upon a Pilgrimage to a place called <HI>Imam-Hu&s;&s;ein</HI> or <HI>Kerbela,</HI> where there is great devotion payed; it is the place where <HI>Hu&s;&s;ein</HI> was killed, and where his Tomb is; and is about four days Journey from <HI>Bagdad</HI> towards <HI>Mo&s;ul</HI> in <HI>Me&s;opotamia.</HI> Towards the Evening that day, we had a great &s;hower of Rain, but it was pre&s;ently over; and it was &s;o cold in the Night-time, that though I was in my Cloaths, (for I never &s;tript in the Fields,) I &s;tood in need of my coverlet, and that cold encrea&s;ed daily the farther we advanced on our way.</P>
<P>We parted from that place on <HI>Friday</HI> the nine and twentieth of <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> at two a Clock in the Morning, and having marched three hours longer among the hills we came into better Way, though the Mountains &s;till &s;urrounded us, but we mounted onely &s;ome &s;mall A&s;cents, until marching Northwards, we began an hour after, to have ups and downs again over very high hills, and in wor&s;e and more dangerous ways than hitherto we had &s;een; but that la&s;ted not an hour, and then we came into a Plain encompa&s;&s;ed with hills. Standing away Ea&s;twards we came by a Village called <HI>Chegiafar,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Chegiafar.</NOTE> where there are a great many &s;cattering hou&s;es, of which part are built of rough Stone and Earth, and &s;ome of Canes and Reeds, covered with green branches; tho&s;e of Earth &s;erve for the Winter and Rainy weather, and then no body lived in them; and the other of Canes are for the Summer, that the Inha|bitants may have the fre&s;h Air. Among&s;t the&s;e hou&s;es, there is al&s;o a great Mo&s;que built of rough Stone and Earth: We made no &s;top there, but a little beyond it, came and encamped near another Village con&s;i&s;ting, (as the for|mer)

Towards the Evening &s;ome of the&s;e <HI>Curds</HI> came to our Tent, and bid us take heed to our &s;elves, becau&s;e there were Robbers in the hills, who creep|ing on their Bellies in the Night-time, came and carried away what they could find: We &s;hew'd them our Arms, which they &s;eemed to be much in love with; many among&s;t us believed that they them&s;elves were the onely Thieves, and that they came to give us this warning, that we might not ac|cu&s;e them if we were robbed, and al&s;o that they might &s;ee our Arms.</P>
<P>We parted from thence on <HI>Saturday</HI> the thirtieth of <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> half an hour after two in the Morning. We went up hill and down hill, over exceeding high and trouble&s;ome Mountains until eight a Clock; after that we marched for two hours in a plain environed with hills, where we &s;aw &s;everal black Tents; and about ten a Clock we encamped under Trees, in a place called <HI>Rengpereng,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Rengpereng.</NOTE> near which a Brook runs: There was clo&s;e by a Village of <HI>Curds,</HI> who brought us provi&s;ions.</P>
<P>We parted from thence on <HI>Sunday</HI> the la&s;t of <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> about four of the Clock in the Morning. At fir&s;t we marched Ea&s;tward, among&s;t Woods of Che&s;tnut-trees, where there is great plenty of liquorice, as there is all that Countrey over; we kept going upward &s;till, but in very good and ea&s;ie way. In the Morning we &s;aw a Field &s;owed with Rice. About &s;even a Clock we encamped in a Plain, where there are &s;ome Trees, near a Hamlet of three or four Huts of Canes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Goaour.</NOTE> and this place is called <HI>Goaour.</HI> We parted from thence the &s;ame day about &s;even at Night, and by Moon-light marched Ea&s;tward in the Plain or Valley, till pa&s;t Midnight, that we de&s;cended by an ugly way into a very low Plain, where having travelled almo&s;t an hour, we pa&s;&s;ed a little Water. Having marched about another hour, we pa&s;&s;ed a Stone-Bridge of one Arch, under which runs a little River that I could not learn the Name of; a little after, we pa&s;&s;ed over another Bridge much alike, &s;tanding upon the &s;ame River.</P>
<P>About half an hour after two in the Morning <HI>Munday</HI> the fir&s;t of <HI>Sep|tember,</HI> we encamped at the end of that Bridge, near to a Village called <HI>Arnoua,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Arnoua.</NOTE> where there is a good <HI>Kervan&s;erai</HI> of brick; there are al&s;o &s;everal Stone-hou&s;es, and as many Huts of Canes; The&s;e Bridges &s;eem to have been lately built, and the River that runs under them has no other Name among&s;t the People of the Countrey, but the Water of <HI>Arnoua.</HI> There are &s;o many Frogs in that Countrey, that my Tent was always full of them, though they were continually driven out.

Half an hour after five, we de&s;cended into a great Plain where we marched about an hour &s;till Ea&s;tward.

We lookt upon it to be very fair and commodious, e&s;pecially becau&s;e of a little River that runs clo&s;e by it; it is called from the Name of the Vil|lage <HI>Maide&s;cht Soui.</HI> We cro&s;&s;ed over it upon a Bridge of one Arch, which is built very &s;teep and &s;harp as mo&s;t of the re&s;t are; we then kept on our way Ea&s;tward in the &s;ame &s;mooth Plain.</P>
<P><PB N="69" REF="201"><HI>Wedne&s;day</HI> the third of <HI>September</HI> a litttle after Midnight, we went over a hill, but the way was plea&s;ant enough, and then came into the Plain again.

Pa&s;&s;ing through that <HI>Portico,</HI> one enters into the Court; in the middle of this of <HI>Poul Schah</HI> there is a Fountain, which is not to be found in others. All round the Court there are great Arches, about three fathom wide, and one and a half or two fathom deep, under which are <HI>Ma&s;tabez,</HI> or &s;tone <HI>Divans,</HI> about two foot rai&s;ed from the ground: In the middle of the Front, (or if you will,) at the bottom of the <HI>Divan,</HI> there is a door about two foot wide, where one enters into a Room of the &s;ame bigne&s;s as the place under the Arch without, and that Chamber has its Chimney.

The&s;e appartments are &s;eparated one from another by a partition Wall about three foot thick. On the back-&s;ide all round the <HI>Han,</HI> are the Stables, where the Hor&s;es may &s;tand dry under roof, a&s;well as the Men, and there are be&s;ides on one &s;ide Arches with <HI>Ma&s;tabez</HI> and Chimneys, where one may lodge, when the appartments of the Court are taken up. They enter into it by four Gates, one at each Corner of the Court. The whole Fabrick is covered with a Terra&s;s, upon which one may walk all round, and the way up to it is by two pair of Stairs, which are on the two &s;ides of the <HI>Portico</HI> I mentioned, at the entry.

All that Bridge is of brick except the Pillars with their &s;harp points and buttere&s;&s;es.

Half an hour after &s;even, we cro&s;&s;ed over a Bridge of four Arches, under which runs a pretty broad River, but &s;hallow, and it is called <HI>Camoutedona.</HI> An hour after, we came to a big Town,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Camoutedona,</HI> a River. <HI>Kenghever.</HI></NOTE> called <HI>Kenghever,</HI> where we lodged in a <HI>Kervan&s;erai.</HI> This is a large Town, well built and populous; a Rivulet runs by it, which they call the Water of <HI>Kenghever.</HI> About it are a great many Gardens, full of Fruit-trees of all &s;orts, and it mu&s;t heretofore have been a con&s;iderable place, for there are the Walls of a Fortre&s;s &s;till &s;tanding, almo&s;t entire; they are built of Flints and other very hard Stones that are both large and thick, and &s;ome Tow|ers &s;till remain, with &s;everal pieces of white Marble-Pillars, of which the Capitals are &s;o thick, that it's enough for three men to embrace them. A|mong&s;t others at a little di&s;tance from a Tower, clo&s;e by this Fort, there are &s;ome Port-holes for great Guns, and a Gate towards the Countrey, where two Pede&s;tals of Marble are &s;till remaining, which formerly carried Pillars, and the&s;e Pede&s;tals (which are four or five foot in length,) are placed at three or four foot di&s;tance from one another, both upon a very thick Wall of fair Stone, with a very lovely wreath on the out&s;ide: So that in all probability the&s;e Pillars &s;upported &s;ome Pavillion, or Balcony for pro&s;pect, or &s;ome thing el&s;e that was very weighty. This Fortre&s;s is built upon an Eminence, which affords a very di&s;tant pro&s;pect, and the Town is the la&s;t place of <HI>Curdi&s;tan</HI> which terminates here. Before I leave it for good and all,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The utmo&s;t bounds of <HI>Curdi&s;tan. Curds.</HI></NOTE> I mu&s;t &s;ay &s;omewhat of the People that inhabit it.</P>
<P>The <HI>Curdi</HI> called anciently <HI>Carduchi,</HI> live in the Summer-time in Huts made of Canes and Boughs of Trees, and in Winter under Tents: Their Countrey is &s;o mountainous, and &s;o hard to be pa&s;&s;ed, that I do not now wonder that the King of <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> (every time that he went to be&s;iege <HI>Bagdad,</HI>) in&s;tead of taking Cannon with him, carried upon Camels metal to ca&s;t them, obliging every Trooper be&s;ides to carry an <HI>Oque;</HI> for it is ab&s;olutely im+po&s;&s;ible to have Cannon drawn along the&s;e ways. Though the&s;e <HI>Curds</HI> lead a life much like the <HI>Arabs,</HI> neverthele&s;s, they are more warlike, and make very good u&s;e of Harquebu&s;es; nay in all places we pa&s;t through, there were always &s;ome of them who came and cheapened our Arms, thinking they had been to be &s;old: Among&s;t others one of them once offered me ten <HI>Aba&s;&s;is</HI> for my Fire-lock. The&s;e <HI>Curds</HI> in&s;tead of Candle, burn onely Oil of <HI>Naphta,</HI> which is got in a place not far from <HI>Bagdad.</HI></P>
<P>We parted from <HI>Kenghever,</HI> the &s;ame day about half an hour after eleven at Night, and in a very good Road, marched Northwards. About three a Clock in the Morning <HI>Wedne&s;day</HI> the tenth of <HI>September,</HI> we pa&s;t over a fair Bridge of &s;ix Arches, called the Bridge of <HI>Scheich-Hali-Kan,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Scheich-Hali-Kan.</NOTE> from the name of a <HI>Chan</HI> that founded it; the River that runs under it is called the Water of <HI>Scheich-Hali-Kan</HI> Bridge; for to Bridges they give the Name of the Founder, and to the Waters that run under them the Name of the Bridge. An hour after, we went by a Village, which we onely &s;aw by Moon-light, but it &s;eemed to me to be big and well built: Having afterwards marched through a great Plain for a long while, about &s;even of the Clock in the Mor|ning we came to a Town called <HI>A&s;ad Abad.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">A&s;ad Abad.</NOTE></P>
<P>That Town or rather Burrough is of a va&s;t extent, and well built: There are &s;treight large Streets in it, and in the middle of them a running Brook. The Entries into all the Hou&s;es are hand&s;om, though the Doors of many of them be but low, and have many Gardens round them. We lodged in the Fields without but clo&s;e by the Town, and parted from thence the &s;ame day, about ten a Clock at Night, directing our way full Ea&s;t. Immediately after, in very good way, we went up a hill called <HI>Elouend;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Elouend.</NOTE> (it is &s;o high that it

took us a compleat hour to mount it, and almo&s;t three quarters of an hour in coming down again on the other &s;ide:) After that, we went by a little hou&s;e of <HI>Rahdars,</HI> where for every hor&s;e there are two <HI>Cabeghis</HI> of <HI>Caffare</HI> to be payed. Then we marched above two hours and a half among&s;t Moun|tains, and there after came into a Plain, where having pa&s;t by a great many Villages, and cro&s;&s;ed &s;everal Brooks; and half an hour after five, having left a Town called <HI>Zaga</HI> to the left hand,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Zaga.</NOTE> two hours after, we arrived at <HI>Hamadan,</HI> where we lodged in a <HI>Kervan&s;erai,</HI> and payed a <HI>Bi&s;ti,</HI> which is worth four <HI>Cabeghis,</HI> a day for a Room.

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. II.</HI> Of the Road from <HI>Hamadan</HI> to <HI>I&s;pahan.</HI></HEAD>
<P><HI>HAmadan</HI> is a very large Town, but contains many void places, Gardens, and even ploughed Fields within it. The hou&s;es are lovely and built onely of Bricks baked in the Sun: There is no fair Street in it, but that where they &s;ell Stuffs, Cloaths ready made, and &s;uch like Commodities. It is a &s;treight, long and broad Street, and the &s;hops of it are well furni&s;hed; it lies near the <HI>Bezestein,</HI> which is little, but pretty well built. This is a con&s;iderable Town of Traffick, and in former times was very &s;trong; it had a fair Ca&s;tle, which was a long time agoe demoli&s;hed by the <HI>Turks,</HI> who much ruined the Town al&s;o. The Air is very bad here, and &s;o is the Water too; there is no Wine to be found in this place, but onely Brandy. Many of our Caravan fell &s;ick during the time we &s;tayed there; for my part, I was taken with a loo&s;ene&s;s that &s;oon after was followed by a Feaver, which I carried with me to <HI>I&s;pahan,</HI> where both held me above a Month, and the Watch-maker that went with me, fell into a Quartane-ague &s;hortly after he arrived at <HI>I&s;pahan.</HI> The <HI>Armenians</HI> have a Church in <HI>Hamadan,</HI> but kept in bad order. There is commonly a <HI>Chan</HI> who commands in that place; but at that time there was none there, onely a <HI>Deroga,</HI> to whom the King &s;ent a pre&s;ent of a Ve&s;t,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The ceremo|ny of a <HI>Khalat</HI> or King's Ve&s;t.</NOTE> while I was there. There was no other Ceremony in it, but that the <HI>Deroga</HI> went out about eight or nine a Clock in the Morning by the King's Gate, &s;o called, becau&s;e by that Gate they go to <HI>I&s;pahan;</HI> and then advanced to a Hou&s;e about a quarter of a <HI>French</HI> League di&s;tant, where he put on the Ve&s;t which the King &s;ent him, being of Cloath of Gold; and pre&s;ently returned to the Town amid&s;t a Body of fifty or &s;ixty of the chief Inhabitants on Hor&s;e-back, who marched almo&s;t all a brea&s;t without any order whil&s;t they were in the Fields.</P>
<P>Having &s;tayed eight days at <HI>Hamadan</HI> we bargained with a Muletor, for five <HI>Aba&s;&s;is</HI> for every &s;addle-Hor&s;e, and for our Goods at the rate of eleven for the hundred <HI>Patmans</HI> of <HI>Tauris;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">A hundred <HI>Patmans</HI> of <HI>Tauris</HI> are a|bout &s;ix hun|dred weight.</NOTE> the hundred <HI>Patmans</HI> of <HI>Tauris,</HI> are near &s;ix hundred weight, and that was a cheap bargain: But the Muletor, (who perhaps repented what he had done,) re&s;olved to &s;tay for the Caravan with which we came, and was not to depart till eight days after; and we being told that there was an <HI>Aga</HI> come who guarded Butter and other Provi&s;ions that were going to the King; we &s;ent for his Muletor, who furni&s;hed us with Saddle-hor&s;es for &s;ix <HI>Aba&s;&s;is,</HI> and for our luggage we payed at the rate of fif|teen <HI>Aba&s;&s;is</HI> for the hundred <HI>Patmans</HI> of <HI>Tauris.</HI> To this beginning of a Ca|ravan many others joyned who were as weary as we of &s;taying at <HI>Hamadan;</HI> &s;o that all together we made a Caravan &s;trong enough not to be afraid of Robbers: For though they &s;ay there are none in <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> yet at that time there were &s;everal gangs of them abroad; becau&s;e the <HI>Chan</HI> of that quarter being dead, there was no other as yet &s;ent in his place.</P>
<P><PB N="73" REF="203">We parted from <HI>Hamadan,</HI> on <HI>Saturday</HI> the twentieth of <HI>September,</HI> at five a Clock in the Morning, and having pa&s;t through a good part of the Town, we went out by the King's Gate, or the Gate of <HI>I&s;pahan,</HI> taking our way Ea&s;tward. We cro&s;&s;ed &s;everal fair Waters, and about &s;even a Clock a Bridge of five Arches, under which runs a Rivulet, that in the Winter-time &s;wells high. Having travelled one hour more over little hills, we found two ways, and not knowing which of the two to take, becau&s;e we were got a great way before the Caravan, we were obliged, <HI>Mon&s;ieur Jacob,</HI> three <HI>Turks</HI> and my &s;elf to &s;tay &s;ometime for it. After we had waited there above half an hour to no purpo&s;e, we thought it not fit to return back, for fear it might have taken another way, and therefore at a venture all five of us took the way to the left hand,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ni&s;char.</NOTE> and continued on till we came to a Town called <HI>Ni&s;|char,</HI> by which we knew the Caravan was to pa&s;s: We arrived there about three a Clock after Noon, and took &s;helter in a wretched <HI>Kervan&s;erai</HI> with|out the Town, that was all ruinous. All the furniture we had was a Co|verlet which we &s;pread under us, that we might not lye upon the bare ground, and a leathern Ve&s;&s;el which they call <HI>Matara,</HI> to hold water in;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Matara.</NOTE> for my man and all our baggage was with the Caravan. We took patience however, and in the mean time, immediately after the Caravan had pa&s;&s;ed the Bridge, it held along the River-&s;ide and came to lodge at a Village called <HI>Boulou&s;ch Ki&s;ar.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Boulou&s;ch Ki&s;ar.</NOTE></P>
<P>Next day being <HI>Sunday</HI> the one and twentieth of <HI>September,</HI> it parted from thence. About two a Clock in the Morning, and about &s;ix arrived at <HI>Ni&s;|char:</HI> Having there payed a due of four <HI>Bi&s;tis</HI> a load, it went on without &s;topping, and we having joyned it again, half an hour after nine encamped under Trees near a Village called <HI>Haran,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Haran.</NOTE> where our Moucres gave us war|ning to keep good guard in the Night-time. The truth is, in the Day-time &s;everal Pa&s;&s;engers &s;topt, and at a di&s;tance con&s;idered our Arms, and two hours af|ter Night, a man pa&s;&s;ing near to us, and making no an&s;wer when he was asked who came there, my man advanced towards him; but then the Robber (who came onely to &s;ee how Affairs &s;tood,) &s;aid that he belonged to the Caravan, which was immediately contradicted by &s;ome of our Company, who told him that if he came that way again, they would fire upon him</P>
<P>Next day being <HI>Monday</HI> the two and twentieth of <HI>September</HI> we parted from that place about two of the Clock in the Morning, and proceeding on &s;till Ea&s;tward in good way, we pa&s;&s;ed by &s;everal great Villages, which we found every quarter of an hour almo&s;t; and being come to a River above two fathom over, which they call the River of <HI>Dizava,</HI> we marched up it about half an hour, and then having pa&s;t over, entered into a &s;pacious Plain, of which in two or three hours time we pa&s;&s;ed over a great part; and came to a Town called <HI>Dizava,</HI> &s;o hid among Gardens which take up the whole breadth of the Plain, that as a Curtain they not onely intercept the view of the Town, but al&s;o of part of the Plain which reaches a good way beyond it. An hour before we arrived there, and being very near it, we were fain to fetch a great compa&s;s to pa&s;s a Rivulet that was broad, deep, and very full of mud, and then came to a little point which gave us a pa&s;&s;age into <HI>Dizava,</HI> where we kept marching on &s;till along great Lanes made by Gardens on both hands, that were well walled, but without any Habitation, and <HI>Dizava</HI> lies &s;o hid, that not a Hou&s;e of it is to be &s;een till you be in it, though you were never &s;o nigh; &s;o that he who did not un|der&s;tand the Map of the Countrey, would think him&s;elf near a Fore&s;t, for it is of a pretty large extent. We pa&s;t through a con&s;iderable part of the Town which is very ill built, and about ten a Clock came to a good <HI>Kervan|&s;erai.</HI> The ignorance of our Moucres was the cau&s;e of that compa&s;s we fetcht, and be&s;ides, all their Bea&s;ts both &s;addle and carriage Hor&s;es were &s;o bad, that it was impo&s;&s;ible to make them go fa&s;ter than A&s;&s;es; &s;o that we made but very &s;mall Journeys. In the Evening we had a &s;hower of rain that was pre&s;ently over, which was the fir&s;t, &s;ave onely a little mizling, that we had &s;een fall &s;ince our departure from <HI>Aleppo.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="74" REF="204">Next day being <HI>Tue&s;day</HI> the three and twentieth of <HI>September,</HI> about three a Clock in the Morning, we &s;et out again, and continued our Journey Ea&s;t|wards by very good way. About &s;even a Clock, we came into a very &s;to|ny way betwixt rocky hills, but it la&s;ted not long; about eleven a Clock we came to a large Village called <HI>Sari,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Sari.</NOTE> and re&s;olved to lodge in a very pretty and large <HI>Kervan&s;erai,</HI> but it was as full already as it could hold of Men and Bea&s;ts: Wherefore it behoved us to betake our &s;elves to another which was le&s;s, bad and ruinous, where we lodged very unea&s;ily in the Stable among&s;t the Hor&s;es and Mules. This Village is well built, and I ob&s;erved that the chief Wall of the Stable where we lodged was wholely built of black &s;quare Stones,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A kind of Marble.</NOTE> about a foot long, and about three fingers thick, which (when they are broken) &s;plit into Tables like &s;late, but thicker, and I took them for black Marble. The Watc-hmaker that was with us, told me that men of his pro|fe&s;&s;ion make u&s;e of this &s;tone for poli&s;hing that which hath been filed, before it be guilt. Of this Marble are all the doors of hou&s;es, (as <HI>Pietro Della Valle</HI> &s;ays,) but there are few of them at <HI>Sari:</HI> Some I &s;aw at <HI>Dizava,</HI> nay, and I have &s;een of them in &s;everal places of <HI>Syria,</HI> and I believe they make them of this Stone for want of Timber. At <HI>Sari</HI> there is four <HI>Bi&s;tis</HI> to be payed a load. This Evening there fell &s;ome rain again, and it came to us ac|companied with good old White wine, which the Porter of the <HI>Kervan&s;erai,</HI> underhand &s;ent for to the Village, but his &s;cruples were onely in formality: For &s;ome <HI>Turks</HI> of our Caravan who had al&s;o bought of it, found it to be &s;o good, that they &s;ate by it merrily all Night, till we were ready to depart; which put them into &s;o good a humour, that for part of the way they did nothing but roar and &s;ing like drunken <HI>Francks,</HI> as they were, till at length one of the gang tumbled off of his Mule, and had almo&s;t broken his Neck, but fell fa&s;t a &s;leep on the place.</P>
<P>About three a Clock in the Morning, <HI>Wedne&s;day</HI> the four and twentieth of <HI>September,</HI> we parted from <HI>Sari:</HI> About eight a Clock we pa&s;&s;ed by a Village called <HI>Dehile,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Dehile.

<P>We parted from thence next day, being <HI>Thur&s;day</HI> the five and twentieth of <HI>September</HI> at Midnight, and by break of day pa&s;&s;ed through a Town cal|led <HI>Scheher-ghird,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Scheher-ghird.</NOTE> which &s;eemed to me to be well built; we then marched forwards till ten of the Clock, through a large barren Plain, there being no Water in it, nor indeed, any habitation that we could find.

<P>The lintels of the gates of it are made of one entire piece of that kind of Marble which I mentioned to be at <HI>Sari,</HI> but it is not poli&s;hed; and with|out the gate, there is on each &s;ide a <HI>Ma&s;tabe;</HI> they are in length about &s;ix foot each, and four or five foot high, upon three of breadth; the upper part of the&s;e <HI>Ma&s;tabez,</HI> is of one whole piece of that Stone.</P>
<P>This Marble hath been dug about fifty paces from the gate, out of a Rock a little higher than the ground, at the root whereof there is a little Spring of Water, which is all they have in that place to drink. As I was walking a|bout this <HI>Kervan&s;erai,</HI> I found little Marble-Stones white, red, &s;potted and of all &s;orts of colours: Which makes me think that that place affords Marble of all colours; and indeed, the upper part of the Rock is almo&s;t all white.</P>
<P><PB N="75" REF="204">We parted next day being <HI>Friday</HI> the &s;ix and twentieth of <HI>September,</HI> a|bout three of the Clock in the Morning, and went up hill and down hill in pretty good way for the &s;pace of three hours.

Half an hour after &s;ix in the Morning, we came to another Village called <HI>Ithoua,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ithoua.</NOTE> where we lodged in a little <HI>Kervan&s;erai,</HI> all built of Clods of unburnt greyi&s;h Earth.

<P>We left this Lodging on <HI>Munday</HI> the nine and twentieth of <HI>September,</HI> about two a Clock in the Morning, and had pretty good way. A little be|fore day, we went down into a very low and &s;pacious ground, all of white &s;and, through which, (by what I could judge,) &s;ome great torrent mu&s;t run when the &s;now melts, for on both &s;ides there are banks of Earth pretty high and &s;teep; we left that way &s;oon after, and going up hill a little, came into a great Plain, where having proceeded a little, we &s;tayed for the Cara|van that was behind us, there being none before but tho&s;e who were light mounted. The rea&s;on why we made that halt was, becau&s;e at a pretty di&s;tance we di&s;covered on the Plain near the hills, &s;ome Hor&s;e-men who kept &s;till on the &s;ame ground, and when we pa&s;&s;ed them they made a great &s;moak; I know not the meaning of that &s;ignal, but we under&s;tood after|wards that they were fifteen in company, and had robbed a Caravan. A quarter of an hour after, we &s;aw five <HI>Antelopes;</HI> and at length about half an hour after nine, we came to a good <HI>Kervan&s;erai,</HI> near to a Village called <HI>Arbane.</HI> An hour after we had been there, a Hor&s;e-man came in,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Arbane.</NOTE> and made &s;ome turns there, whereupon &s;ome of our company &s;aying to one another that he was a robber, and that they ought to lay hands on him, he per|ceiving it, went out of the <HI>Kervan&s;erai,</HI> and &s;o put &s;purs to his hor&s;e, and made ha&s;te to a Tree where two of his Comrades were. About Midnight &s;ome Hor&s;e-men bounced at the Gate of the <HI>Kervan&s;erai,</HI> and becau&s;e we would not open to them, they made a great noi&s;e, till the Gate was opened; they were ten in company con&s;i&s;ting of <HI>Per&s;ians, Curds</HI> and <HI>Arabs;</HI> they were all armed with Lances, and &s;ome had hawks upon their Fi&s;ts; they asked if our Caravan was going to <HI>I&s;pahan,</HI> and we asked them whither they were bound: They &s;aid to <HI>I&s;pahan,</HI> but when we asked them whence they came they would not tell, but onely that they were going to <HI>I&s;pahan;</HI> which made us think they were robbers, and therefore many of our com|pany &s;lept not one wink, though afterwards we came to under&s;tand that they were not robbers</P>
<P>We &s;et out about three a Clock next Morning, and our ten Hor&s;e-men-&s;tayed behind in the <HI>Kervan&s;erai,</HI> which made &s;ome think they onely came to plunder the <HI>Kervan&s;erai,</HI> and perhaps, to cut our Throats. About break of day we entered into a dangerous pa&s;s for robbing; for it is a narrow way betwixt high Rocks, behind which &s;everal men may lye hid, and fire upon whom they plea&s;e without being di&s;covered.

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. III.</HI> Of <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> in General.</HEAD>
<P>BEfore I enter into the de&s;cription of what I have ob&s;erved at <HI>I&s;pahan,</HI> I think it will not be impertinent to give the Reader a general notion of <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> which is a Kingdom onely &s;trong becau&s;e environed with Mountains, and barren De&s;arts, that defend it again&s;t the attempts of its mo&s;t powerfull Enemies. And indeed, the forces that are entertained therein (of whom I &s;hall &s;peak in the Chapter of the Court,) or (if you will,) the Armies that have been rai&s;ed there in our days, are &s;o incon&s;iderable, in re&s;pect of &s;o va&s;t a Countrey, that the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> are not to be reckoned among&s;t formidable Powers.</P>
<P>The cau&s;e of that weakne&s;s is the &s;carcity of money in tho&s;e Countreys, which cannot &s;uffice to &s;et on foot great Armies, and far le&s;s to maintain them; this want of money proceeds from the &s;mall trade the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> drive, having but few Goods among&s;t them proper to be exported, to wit, &s;ome Silk which is made in the <HI>Gheilan</HI> and <HI>Mazendaran;</HI> Carpets and wrought Stuffs, and hardly any thing el&s;e con&s;iderable: In &s;o much, that it may be &s;aid of <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> that it is as a <HI>Kervan&s;erai</HI> that &s;erves for pa&s;&s;age to the mo|ney that goes out of <HI>Europe</HI> and <HI>Turkey</HI> to the <HI>Indies;</HI> and to the Stuffs and Spices that come from the <HI>Indies,</HI> into <HI>Turkey</HI> and <HI>Europe,</HI> whereof it makes &s;ome &s;mall profit in the pa&s;&s;age.</P>
<P>The &s;oyl of the bordering Countreys, (&s;peaking generally,) is very bad,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The &s;oil of <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> in ge|neral.</NOTE> not onely by rea&s;on of the many Mountains, but al&s;o of the want of water and wood in mo&s;t places thereof; there being no other Trees but fruit-Trees that are enclo&s;ed within Gardens; for there are none to be found in the Fields, though the Countrey People &s;eem to be carefull and diligent enough in cultivating, &s;owing and planting all the Land that is good. It is true, the great pains they take in making Gardens, and cultivating them, for the be|nefit they make of the Fruit which are exceedingly much eaten in <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> makes them a little neglect the re&s;t of their grounds; for after we had pa&s;t <HI>Curdi&s;tan,</HI> I &s;aw in &s;everal places very good Land and Hills, which (in my opinion,) would be very fruitfull, if they were well cultivated and manured. Nay, in many of the&s;e places there is plenty of excellent good water, where|with (in my Judgment,) they might water their grounds, by making Ditches through them, as they do in other parts: And neverthele&s;s, I cannot tell why they are de&s;art, and full of Liquorice, or &s;uch like &s;hrubs, and no Trees growing in them.</P>
<P>There are &s;o many Brooks in &s;everal Countreys of <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> that I believe the ways are very bad to travel in in the Winter-time; for though we were about the end of Summer, yet we pa&s;&s;ed &s;ome which were full of thick mud at the bottom. The <HI>Mazandaran</HI> indeed, is a very lovely Countrey,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mazandaran.</NOTE> aboun|ding with Plants, Fruit and Wood as well as <HI>Europe;</HI> and good rea&s;on why; for it is watered by many Springs and Rivers, which having run through the Countrey, fall into the <HI>Ca&s;pian</HI> Sea that is near it.

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. IV.</HI> Of what hath been ob&s;erved in <HI>I&s;pahan.</HI></HEAD>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">I&s;pahan.</NOTE><HI>ISpahan</HI> is the Capital City of the Province of <HI>Irac,</HI> (which is part of the ancient <HI>Parthia</HI>) and generally of the whole Kingdom of <HI>Per&s;ia;</HI> for in this Town the King holds his ordinary re&s;idence. The Air of it is extremely dry, therefore what the Earth produces for, the food of man is ea&s;ily pre|&s;erved there all the year round. I cannot tell but it may be attributed to this di&s;po&s;ition of the Air what commonly happens, that all the Bodies whether of Men or Bea&s;ts, an hour after they are dead, &s;well extremely; which may be occa&s;ioned by this &s;o dry an Air, that penetrating into the Bodies drives out the humidity, which being extrava&s;ated betwixt the Fle&s;h and Skin, endeavours to break out, and &s;o puffs them up until it hath found an I&s;&s;ue when the parts of it have been &s;ufficiently &s;ubtilized: The hands and feet likewi&s;e &s;well at the end of all Sickne&s;&s;es, which continues &s;ome weeks before the cau&s;e of it be di&s;cu&s;&s;ed. Neverthele&s;s in time of Rain, there are great damps, &s;o that the effects of the humidity are to be &s;een on all things, not onely at <HI>I&s;pahan,</HI> but al&s;o all over <HI>Per&s;ia;</HI> in &s;o much, that all In|&s;truments of Iron ru&s;t, where ever they may be kept, even keys in ones Pocket, as I &s;everal times found by experience. The truth is, it rains there very &s;eldom unle&s;s it be in Winter: And whil&s;t I was there, the fir&s;t Rain that fell was on the eleventh of <HI>December:</HI> But likewi&s;e when it rains the Hou&s;es crumble and fall away in pieces, and the Snow rots the Terra&s;&s;es if they be not paved with Bricks, and &s;eeing mo&s;t of them are of Earth, the Snow mu&s;t be thrown off a&s;&s;oon as it falls upon them.</P>
<P>In the year one thou&s;and &s;ix hundred &s;ixty and five, there was a great Rain in all that extent of Countrey, which reaches from <HI>Bender Aba&s;&s;i</HI> and <HI>Bender Cougo,</HI> till within three or four days Journey of <HI>Schiras,</HI> and that rain la&s;ted from the beginning of <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> untill the middle of <HI>September;</HI> &s;o that it &s;eemed the Winter of the <HI>Indies</HI> had &s;hifted into that Countrey, but that was lookt upon as a thing extraordinary.</P>

<P>At the corner of the <HI>Meidan</HI> betwixt South and We&s;t there is a Street, in which to the right hand is the Gate of the King's <HI>Haram,</HI> (that's to &s;ay his Wifes hou&s;e,) and on the left hand is his <HI>Karchanee,</HI> (that's to &s;ay his Work-hou&s;e;) becau&s;e all the Workmen of every &s;ort of trade, who are under his pay work there; they all have their &s;hops, and it is like to an Ar&s;enal where all trades are to be found.</P>
<P>One of the fine&s;t things to be &s;een at <HI>I&s;pahan</HI> are the &s;tately Gardens of <HI>Hezar Dgerib,</HI> the chief building whereof is plea&s;ant, and at the end of the fair Street of <HI>Tcharbag</HI> or <HI>Tcheharbag;</HI> but &s;ince that Street leads to it,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Street of <HI>Tcheharbag.</HI></NOTE> and that it hath particular beauties of its own, I think fit to de&s;cribe it before I come to the de&s;cription of <HI>Hezar Dgerib.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Tcheharbag</HI> which &s;ignifies four Gardens is a great Street, near a hundred paces broad, and above two <HI>Italian</HI> miles in length. On the &s;ide of <HI>I&s;pahan,</HI> there is at the head and entry into it, a little Pavillion or Square building two &s;tories high, adorned with many Balconys and painted Windows, to which they come from the King's Palace, by a kind of corridor or curtain, and this Street ends at <HI>Hezar Dgerib</HI> as we have ju&s;t now &s;aid. It is bounded on both &s;ides by the Walls of a great many Gardens, and at certain di&s;tances by little hou&s;es of uniform Symmetry, which have all a little Pavillion, and doors that open into the Gardens that belong, &s;ome to the King, and the re&s;t to &s;everal great Lords, who take their diver&s;ion in the&s;e places. About twelve &s;teps from the Garden-Walls, there is on each &s;ide a row of lovely Plane Trees planted in a &s;treight line which yield a rare &s;hade, and in the middle betwixt tho&s;e two rows of Trees, runs along the whole Street a current of Water in a Canal of fair Stone, about five foot deep and thirteen over, ador|ned here and there with Ca&s;cades and &s;ome rare Water-works, which fall into Ba&s;ons: The &s;ides of that Canal are paved into the Street, and make a way of Free-Stone for Foot-men, which ea&s;es them of the inconvenience of meeting hor&s;es that go lower in the Street. In &s;hort, this Street is divided by the River of <HI>Senderu,</HI> on which there is built a very lovely Bridge,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Bridge of lovely Struc|ture.</NOTE> of a pretty &s;ingular &s;tructure, which joyns together the two parts of the Street.</P>
<P>This (Bridge which is called by the Name of him that built it, to wit, <HI>Alyverdy-Chan,</HI> and which is al&s;o named the Bridge of <HI>Julpha,</HI>) is built of good Brick with edgings of Free-Stone; and &s;upported by a great many little and low &s;tone-Arches. It is about three hundred paces long, and about twenty broad, but in the middle where Carts and Hor&s;es goe, it is not above four fathom broad, and is no higher in the middle than at the two ends. On each &s;ide in&s;tead of a Parapet, it hath a Gallery covered with a plat-form, both which are very commodious for Pa&s;&s;engers. The&s;e Galleries are rai&s;ed above the level of the Bridge above half a pikes height: The going up to them is by &s;o ea&s;ie Stairs, that hor&s;es may without trouble a&s;cend them; men are there &s;ecure from bad weather or the heat of the Sun, and yet have an open Air and fair pro&s;pect, for the&s;e vaulted Walks have a great many Windows that look upon the River. If a man de&s;ire a more open pa&s;&s;age, he hath the plat-form over this gallery, that equally reaches from one end of the Bridge to the other: But it is &s;o hot upon it in the Summer-time, that the other way is more commonly taken, which &s;erves al&s;o many times for a Hor&s;e-way in the Winter, that they may avoid the Water that fills up the middle of the
<PB N="82" REF="208">
Bridge, when the River overflows, which &s;ometimes happens, though in the Summer-time it be &s;o low, that there is hardly any Water in it, &s;o that they have been forced to u&s;e art in paving the bottom in that place very &s;mooth, that &s;o it may fill its Channel by &s;preading its Waters equally. This Bridge then hath five pa&s;&s;ages, one in the middle, and four in the two &s;ides; to wit the two covered Galleries, and the two Plat-forms over them which are above twelve foot broad, with Rails both towards the Bridge and River. Nay there is a &s;ixth pa&s;&s;age when the water is low, which during the great heats of Summer is very delightfull for its coolne&s;s; and that is a little vaulted Gallery, which cro&s;&s;es all the Arches from one end of the Bridge to the other; it is low underneath and reacheth to the bottom of the River; but there are Stones &s;o laid that one may &s;tep over without wetting the foot; they go down into it from the Bridge by &s;teps made in the thick|ne&s;s of the Walls.</P>
<P>There are al&s;o two other Bridges upon that River to the right hand; and all the three are at above half a miles di&s;tance from one another. The fir&s;t above this is very plain; but the other which they call the Bridge of <HI>Schiras,</HI> for one thing exceeds the fir&s;t in beauty, and that is a Hexagone place which it hath in the middle, where the Water of the River hath a lovely fall.</P>
<P>Let us now con&s;ider <HI>Hezar Dgerib,</HI> which ends the fair Street of <HI>Tchehar|bag:</HI> The name of it imports a thou&s;and <HI>Dgerib,</HI> and <HI>Dgerib</HI> is a certain land mea&s;ure which the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> have, as we have the pearch, the fathom and other mea&s;ures.</P>
<P>Before this hou&s;e there is a large &s;quare Court, at the end whereof &s;tands the Building, which con&s;i&s;ts of a <HI>Divan,</HI> onely one &s;tory high, with Chambers at its four corners, and it hath the &s;ame front towards the Garden, which in reality, is very pretty.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Gardens of <HI>Hezar-gerib.</HI></NOTE>This Garden of <HI>Hezar-gerib</HI> hath &s;ix &s;tories of Terra&s;&s;es, the Earth of which is &s;upported by &s;tone-Walls, and the&s;e &s;tories are rai&s;ed about a fa|thom in height one above another. There are a great many Alleys or Walks in that Garden both in length and breadth, which reach all from the one end to the other, and are very &s;treight and even, &s;ave that in tho&s;e which reach in length, at every &s;tory, one mu&s;t a&s;cend &s;even or eight &s;teps. The chief Walk or Alley, that begins at the building is very broad, but that which renders it altogether charming, is a &s;tone-Canal in the middle of it, of the &s;ame breadth as that of the Street <HI>Tcheharbag,</HI> which an&s;wers in a &s;treight line to this, and hath no Water but what it receives from it: The Canal of this Walk is far more beautifull than that of the Street, and affords a lovely pro&s;pect, in regard that at every two fathoms di&s;tance there are Pipes which &s;purt up Water very high, and that at each &s;tory there is a &s;heet of Water, that falls into a Ba&s;on underneath, from whence it runs into the Canal: On each &s;ide of the&s;e &s;heets of water, there is a pair of Stairs and a way that leads &s;treight up. I leave it to the Readers imagination, to con|ceive the plea&s;antne&s;s of that pro&s;pect, and the beauty of the&s;e Ca&s;cades, which are the fir&s;t object that offers, and &s;urpri&s;es the &s;ight of tho&s;e that en|ter into this Garden. Walking then along the great Alley, after you have advanced a little, you cro&s;s over a Canal a fathom broad, which cuts it as it does all the other Walks that are parallel thereunto, but without breaking them, for it runs under little brick-Arches.</P>
<P>Mounting up to the fourth &s;tory, you'll find a large place where there is a Ba&s;on of eight &s;ides, above twenty fathom in diameter, and three foot deep of water; it hath Water-pipes that play all round it, be&s;ides one in the mid|dle. On each &s;ide of this place you have a large covered <HI>Divan,</HI> built of Brick, but open on all hands, with a ba&s;on of water in the middle. The&s;e are really charming places, e&s;pecially for enjoying the cool, wherein the Le|vantines place their greate&s;t delight. Having a&s;cended three &s;tories more, you come to a pretty high Building which bounds the Walk, and on both &s;ides of it there is a wall that &s;eparates this part of the Garden from the other beyond it; to the front of this Building, there is a ba&s;on of water. Then you enter into a Hall made cro&s;s-ways, open on the four &s;ides, at each Corner whereof you'll find little rooms: Over that there is another &s;tory which is
<PB N="83" REF="208">
much the &s;ame. From that Hall you enter into the other part of the Gar|den, and recover the great Walk or Alley again, which is continued in a &s;treight line through the Hall: There you have the Canal and Sheets of Wa|ter in the &s;ame manner as in the other, &s;ave that in this part the ba&s;ons are above the &s;heets of water, whereas in the former they are under them.</P>
<P>Having mounted the &s;ixth &s;tory you'll find an octogone Ba&s;on of the &s;ame bigne&s;s as the former, with a <HI>Divan</HI> or <HI>Kiosk</HI> on each hand&punc; After you have a&s;cended three &s;tories more, you pa&s;s over a Canal three fathom broad, which runs cro&s;s all the Walks of the Garden that are parallel to this, as the other does which is at the other end: A little farther, you find a ba&s;on before a building much of the &s;ame contrivance as the others are, which puts an end to the Walk and the length of the Garden.</P>
<P>All the&s;e Waters come from the River of <HI>Senderu,</HI> by Chanels that divert them three or four Leagues above the City, which having watered and em|belli&s;hed this Garden, run and lo&s;e them&s;elves in the Fields. Many &s;uch Cha|nels are drawn from this River above the City, for watering the Gardens, which otherwi&s;e would be barren: For be&s;ides that the Wells could not fur|ni&s;h a &s;ufficient quantity of water; their water is not &s;o good as that of the River, which is made very fat by the grounds that it runs through. Every day is appointed for giving Water to a certain quarter, and every Garden is taxed to pay thirty, forty, or &s;ixty <HI>Aba&s;&s;is</HI> a year, more or le&s;s according to its bigne&s;s, for the water once a week. None of the&s;e Canals return to the River, but lo&s;e them&s;elves in the Fields; which makes the River to be much le&s;&s;ened when it comes to the City, &s;o that having run thorough it, at a little di&s;tance farther, it lo&s;es it &s;elf al&s;o in the Fields.</P>
<P>The <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> are &s;o carefull to have water for their grounds,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The care of the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> for having VVater.</NOTE> that in many places they make Aqueducts under ground, which bring it from a far, nay, and that many Leagues off. They make them almo&s;t two fathom high, and arch them over with Brick: In making of them they digg at every twenty paces di&s;tance or thereabouts, and make large holes like wells, in which they go down and &s;o carry on the Aqueduct, becau&s;e they cannot continue in go|ing on &s;o far under ground; and the&s;e Aqueducts co&s;t a great deal of money.</P>
<P>Although the Garden I have been de&s;cribing is &s;o magnificent, yet you mu&s;t not imagine to find &s;uch lovely Gra&s;s-plats and borders of Flowers as are in <HI>Europe:</HI> There you have onely young Fruit-trees in great numbers, with great Plane-Trees, planted in a row, which are the ornament of it;<NOTE PLACE="marg">The fruits of <HI>Hezar-dgerib.</HI></NOTE> &s;o that in fruit-Sea&s;on it is very plea&s;ant walking there, and &s;ince for a little money all are welcom, one may eat as many as he plea&s;es. There is plenty al&s;o of Ro&s;e Bu&s;hes there, and the Gardiners make money of their Ro&s;es. This Garden is the Kings, &s;o are one half of tho&s;e of <HI>Tcheharbag;</HI> the re&s;t belong to <HI>Chans,</HI> and the&s;e Gardens are almo&s;t all of the &s;ame contrivance; (that's to &s;ay,) that their beauty con&s;i&s;ts in long &s;treight walks, and abundance of Fruit-trees, Ro&s;e-bu&s;hes and Plane-Trees, which yield them a con&s;iderable revenue, and there|fore they are well kept; &s;o that when I went to the Garden of <HI>Hezard-gerib,</HI> I &s;aw a great many People at work in levelling the walks, which had been &s;poilt by the Rain and Snow.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Materials for Ma&s;ons.</NOTE>ALL the Hou&s;es of <HI>I&s;pahan</HI> are built of Bricks baked in the Sun, dawbed over with Clay mingled with Straw, and then white ca&s;t over with a very fine and white Plai&s;ter, which they get out of the neighbouring hills, from a &s;tone that being burnt, is cru&s;hed and broken with a great rowler drawn by a Hor&s;e.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The charges of building a Hou&s;e.</NOTE> The charges of building a hou&s;e they commonly divide into three equal parts, one for Brick, another for Plai&s;ter, and the third for Doors, Windows, and other timber nece&s;&s;ary for a hou&s;e. However &s;ome|thing may be &s;aved in the Brick, for out of the very place where the hou&s;e is to be built; Earth may be had for making all the Bricks that are nece&s;&s;ary, and furni&s;hing Straw to be mingled with the Earth for the making of them, the re&s;t will not amount to above an <HI>Aba&s;&s;i</HI> and a half the thou&s;and, but the truth is, it will co&s;t three times as much in employing them.</P>
<P>In the re&s;t of <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> the Hou&s;es are onely built of that &s;ort of Brick, made of Earth wrought with cut Straw and well incorporated, which is afterwards dried in the Sun, and then employed, but the lea&s;t Rain wa&s;hes them away and di&s;&s;olves all. They make al&s;o tiles which they burn in a Kiln, yet they &s;eldom u&s;e them, but for their Floors and Stair-ca&s;es; &s;ome, but few, pave their Terra&s;&s;es with them.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Roofs of Hou&s;es.</NOTE> Neverthele&s;s it were much more profitable to pave them with Bricks, for being onely of Earth, they mu&s;t be repaired once a year, becau&s;e of the Rain and Snow, which &s;poil them all; nay and as often as Snow falls, they mu&s;t of nece&s;&s;ity throw it off a&s;&s;oon as they can, el&s;e it would rot and by its weight bear down the hou&s;es; but &s;eeing for all their diligence, they mu&s;t needs with the Snow throw a good deal of Earth al&s;o from the Terra&s;&s;es, which are loo&s;ened by it, it would be much &s;afer to pave them, becau&s;e then the Snow might be more ea&s;ily thrown off, and no|thing &s;poilt; but it mu&s;t be al&s;o confe&s;&s;ed, that the Terra&s;&s;es cannot always be paved, becau&s;e of the uneavenne&s;s of the Rooms underneath, &s;ome being higher, and &s;ome lower, nay and &s;ome of them having Domes; which make the Terra&s;&s;es very irregular, and all crooked and convex in &s;everal places.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Much water at <HI>I&s;pahan.</HI></NOTE>There is &s;o much Water at <HI>I&s;pahan,</HI> that one may have a Well dug for three or four <HI>Aba&s;&s;is</HI> commonly; and when it is dug they put down in the bottom one or two Pipes of baked or burnt Clay about three or four foot high, and of the &s;ame Diameter as the Well is, to keep the ground on the &s;ides from falling in and choaking it up.</P>
<P>The Walls that go round the Terra&s;&s;es are all pierced through checker ways, with &s;quare holes about four or five inches &s;quare, not onely to ea&s;e the Walls which are onely of Earth, but al&s;o to let in the Air on all &s;ides.</P>
<P>The <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> u&s;e no Cranes in building of their Hou&s;es, but they rai&s;e high banks of Earth, on which they drag along, what the Crane would lift: Ma|ny times they need neither of the two, for all that they employ is light e|nough. They make their hou&s;es commonly front the North, to receive the fre&s;h Air, and they who can, make them &s;eparated and open on all the four &s;ides. They make their little Vaults very quickly, and in building of them u&s;e Timber as with us;<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Ma&s;ons</HI> call for their materials, as if they were &s;inging.</NOTE> all the&s;e Vaults are of brick, &s;ometimes baked in the Sun, and &s;ometimes in the Oven or Kiln, according as they'll be at the char|ges of it. It it is pretty plea&s;ant to &s;ee a Ma&s;on at work there, for he calls for what he wants as if he were &s;inging, and the Labourers who are always at|tentive to the tone, &s;erve him mo&s;t punctually.</P>
<P><PB N="85" REF="209">In <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> commonly they make the Floors of the Rooms of Joi&s;ts,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Floros.</NOTE> on which they lay planks, and over them a Mat or <HI>Store</HI> and then a lay of Reeds which they cover with Clay half a foot thick: But they ob&s;erve to mingle Salt with the fir&s;t lay of Earth,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Salt mingled with Clay.</NOTE> that the Worms may not get into the Timber underneath.

<P>The <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> make their Lime of Stones which they burn as we doe, and when they have taken them out of the Kiln, they break them into &s;mall pie|ces: When they are to u&s;e it they prepare it in the manner following.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The way of preparing Lime.</NOTE> They &s;weep a place very clean to &s;ift the Lime in, and when it is &s;ifted they make it up in a heap &s;harp at the top like a Sugar-Loaf; then they &s;ift A&s;hes upon it, and that in almo&s;t as great a quantity as the lime; that being done, they &s;weep the adjoyning place very clean and water it, and over the wet, &s;ift a very &s;light lay of A&s;hes; then with Iron-&s;hovels they throw upon it their Lime mingled with A&s;hes, working and incorporating them well together: When they have ca&s;t on three or four &s;hovel fulls, one of them throws upon it about a quarter of a Bucket full of Water or &s;omewhat le&s;s, and the re&s;t ca&s;t very fa&s;t upon the wet Lime, other Lime mingled with A&s;hes, &s;o that they give not the Water time to penetrate through that fir&s;t lime; then they throw on a good deal of water more, and then another quantity of lime and a&s;hes, and they keep this cour&s;e, untill they have put all the lime which they had mingled with A&s;hes into a heap; and the water they throw upon it is &s;o little in regard of the quantity of that matter, that it &s;carcely appears to be wet. After this, they &s;weep a neighbouring place, and having watered, and then covered it with a few A&s;hes as before, they turn over again the mixture that they may well mingle and incorporate the A&s;hes with the lime; and &s;o turn it over from one &s;ide to another &s;everal times, (that's to &s;ay) nine or ten times.</P>
<P>But it is to be ob&s;erved that after the fir&s;t time, they pour no more water upon the mixture; but onely from time to time lightly &s;prinkle with the hand the out&s;ide of the heap, to keep it a little humid without appearing to be wet; but every time they ca&s;t the heap from one &s;ide to another, they are &s;ure fir&s;t to &s;weep the place, water it, and then to &s;catter a few A&s;hes upon the &s;ame, and then with their Iron-&s;hovels they turn the heap. I wondered to &s;ee the&s;e People when they prepared their lime, that they were not afraid to burn their feet going bare footed upon that Stuff, nor yet to wrong them&s;elves by receiving into their Mouth and No&s;e, the du&s;t of the lime when they &s;ifted it.</P>
<P>When they have thus well mingled the A&s;hes with the lime, they divide the Stuff into &s;everal heaps, which they &s;pread a little, giving to each about four foot of Diameter, and one foot in thickne&s;s: After that, four of them &s;tand round the heap, and beat the Stuff with &s;ticks &s;omewhat crooked, about two foot and a half long, the handle they hold them by being two fingers thick with a little round knob at the end, to keep them from &s;lipping through their hands, then they grow greater and greater till about the middle where they are as big as ones Arm, and round &s;o far; and from that place where they bend and make an obtu&s;e Angle with the other half, they grow thicker and thicker ac|cording as they come nearer the end, and are round on the concave &s;ide, but flat on the convex, and about the end are about &s;ix fingers broad: The&s;e Clubs are of A&s;h. They beat this Stuff with one hand two and two over again&s;t one another, &s;inging <HI>Y a allah, Y a allah,</HI> and other attributes of God, and keeping time to this tune, which &s;eems to be e&s;&s;ential to the trade, they beat as our Thre&s;hers do &s;ometimes in one place, &s;ometimes in another, &s;tooping at every blow, and nothing but the flat &s;ide of the Club hits the matter. They beat every heap &s;o about half an hour without intermi&s;&s;ion; and then go to another which they beat as much, and continue this exerci&s;e almo&s;t an hour without re&s;ting, onely now and then &s;hifting their hand; after this, they take breath a little for the &s;pace of half a quarter of an hour or le&s;s, and then fall to their bu&s;ine&s;s again. In this manner they beat every heap four or five times, and every time they leave it, it is all reduced to the thickne&s;s of about half a
<PB N="86" REF="210">
foot in the middle, falling thinner towards the edges; and then one of the men takes a &s;pade wherewith he breaks the Lumps, and turns it all up again into a heap: cooling it with a little water that he throws upon it with his hands. When every heap is &s;ufficiently beaten they &s;pread it well, &s;o that it be alike thick in all places, and a little hollow in the middle, then they &s;trow chopt Straw upon it, &s;uch as they give to Hor&s;es; they'll &s;pread upon a heap of lime about a &s;ack full, &s;uch as they give their Hor&s;es provender in, &s;o that the lime is all covered over with it; with that, they pour into the middle of it about four Buckets of water, and mingle all together &s;tirring it well with their &s;ho|vels, that the materials may be well incorporated; and when all is reduced in|to a kind of &s;oft morter, they fall a beating it a new, &s;ometimes with their &s;ho|vels, and &s;ometimes with the end of their Clubs: Then they open it again in the middle making a round hole a good foot and a half wide, &s;o that it looks like a Well rai&s;ed a good foot above ground; they fill this hole with water, pouring in about two Buckets full, and &s;o leave it, after they have &s;moothed the out&s;ide with the back of their &s;hovels, &s;o that it looks poli&s;hed and of a blewi&s;h colour, (that's to &s;ay) like blew Fullers-Earth or Clay to take out grea&s;e and &s;pots with; the&s;e holes are always kept full of water, till they be ready to u&s;e the Stuff. When they are to u&s;e it, they work it with a great deal of water, and mingle therewith about half the quantity of Straw that was employ|ed in the fir&s;t working of it; then they beat it well with &s;hovels and leavers, pouring on &s;o much water, that it is reduced almo&s;t into a liquid running mud. I have &s;een it &s;o employed for covering a great pent-hou&s;e, which was made of &s;ticks or laths laid cro&s;s ways, and two <HI>Stores</HI> over them, upon which they &s;pread a very thin lay of this lime, &s;moothing it with the Trowel: Then they put upon this lay, three fingers thick of Earth mingled with Straw and wrought into a morter. In this which I &s;aw prepared, there were four and twenty A&s;s loads, and four men prepared it: They were near eleven hours about it, and made it up into five Wells or Heaps, which remained &s;o for two days before they were u&s;ed.

<P>In whitening of their Walls they u&s;e no lime, but make u&s;e of a white Earth which is in &s;mall pieces like plai&s;ter, and immediately di&s;&s;olves in water: This Earth they call <HI>Ghil&s;efid,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ghil&s;efid.</NOTE> (that's to &s;ay,) white Earth; they dig it out of cer|tain Pits or Quarries, of which there are many about <HI>I&s;pahan.</HI> As to their morter it is u&s;ually made of plai&s;ter,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The making of Morter.</NOTE> earth and chopped &s;traw, all well wrought and incorporated together.

They ca&s;t their Walls pretty often al&s;o with a mixture made of Plai&s;ter and Earth which they call <HI>Zerdghil,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Zerdghil.</NOTE> (that's to &s;ay,) yellow Earth, though in reality, it be not yellow, but rather of a Musk or Cinnamon colour; they get it on the River-&s;ide, and work it in a great Earthen Ve&s;&s;el, but they put &s;o little earth in proportion to water, that it remains liquid like muddy water, or at mo&s;t like &s;trained Juice, and it is altogether of the Colour of that Earth; they make u&s;e of it to work the Plai&s;ter in another Earthen Ve&s;&s;el, where they mingle this water with plai&s;ter, in &s;uch a quanti|ty, that it be reduced to the thickne&s;s of morter, which retains the colour of that Earth: With this mixture they ca&s;t their Walls, which at fir&s;t look all greyi&s;h, but according as they dry they grow &s;o white, that when they are fully dry, they &s;eem almo&s;t, as if they were plai&s;tered over with pure plai&s;ter.

<P>For making of Terra&s;&s;es, they lay, (as I have &s;aid) upon the <HI>Stores</HI> and reeds almo&s;t half a foot thick of Earth,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The way of making Ter|ra&s;&s;es.</NOTE> but which &s;inks to far le&s;s being trampled and tread upon; when it is well dried in the Air, they lay on more Earth mingled with a like quantity of Straw, which they work well together, &s;tirring it often that they may better incorporate the Straw with the Earth: And when that is well mixt, and reduced to the con&s;i&s;tence of kennel-dirt, they trample it a long while with their feet, and &s;pread it very even all over.

&s;econd lay is commonly about half a foot thick al&s;o; but being dry is hardly half &s;o thick; when it is dry, they lay on a third lay like the former, &s;o that all being dry, it may be about a foot thick. All this is held up by a range of broad burnt Bricks or Tiles which is laid all round the Terra&s;s, five or &s;ix high, and level with the Earth; in &s;ome places they make a little &s;helving, that the rain-Water may run off into wooden Spouts which jet out for conveying it a|way. In this manner I &s;aw two Terra&s;&s;es made, which had in &s;urface each about a fathom and a half &s;quare; when they laid on the &s;econd lay, two men wrought at each about an hours time, &s;tirring the Earth with &s;hovels, and incorporating it with the Straw, whil&s;t another man continually poured water upon it; the la&s;t lay requires the &s;ame labour and pains.</P>

When it is very cold they bring the River-water into the&s;e beds, which freezes very quickly, and when it is thick and hard, they break the Ice of the hollowe&s;t beds into great pieces, which they carry into the Ditch, where they lay it in very good order: Then they break the Ice of the &s;hallower beds, and having put it into the Ditch upon that which they had laid there before, they beat it into very &s;mall morcels with a &s;pade or &s;hovel, and fill up all the chinks that are betwixt the large pie|ces with them: At night they throw a great deal of water over all; which they do with the skins of gourds cut in two pieces, and fa&s;tened to the end of long poles; this water freezes in the Night-time and joyns all the Ice into one piece.

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. XI.</HI> The Continuation of the Ob&s;ervations of <HI>I&s;pahan. Of the Court of</HI> Per&s;ia.</HEAD>
<P>HAving treated of the nature of the <HI>Per&s;ians,</HI> of their Carriage Apparel, and way of living; we may now &s;ee how their Monarch governs them, whom he makes u&s;e of for executing his Orders, and at the &s;ame time ob&s;erve &s;ome of his recreations.</P>
<P><HI>Per&s;ia</HI> is a Monarchy governed by a King,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Monarchy of <HI>Per&s;ia.</HI> The King of <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> ab&s;o|lute in all things.</NOTE> who has &s;o ab&s;olute a pow|er over his Subjects, that no limits can be &s;et to it. He meddles in Religi|on, and they do not begin the <HI>Ramadan,</HI> nor any Fe&s;tival, till fir&s;t they have had his leave, and &s;ometimes he keeps them back a few days according to his plea&s;ure, though the Moon wherein they are to be celebrated hath been &s;een. His Subjects never look upon him but with fear and trembling, and they have &s;uch re&s;pect for him, and pay &s;o blind an obedience to all his Orders, that how unju&s;t &s;oever his Commands might be, they perform them though again&s;t all Law both of God and Nature. Nay if they &s;wear by the King's head, their Oath is more Authentick and of greater credit, than if they &s;wore by all that is mo&s;t &s;acred in Heaven and upon Earth.</P>
<P>He ob&s;erves no form of Ju&s;tice in mo&s;t of his Decrees, and without con&s;ulting any Per&s;on, no not the Laws and Cu&s;tomes, he judges of lives and fortunes, as &s;eems be&s;t to him, without any regard to tho&s;e who feel the weight of his power;<NOTE PLACE="marg">The kinds of puni&s;hments not regulated.</NOTE> and that without ob&s;erving the kinds of puni&s;hments that are in u&s;e in the Countrey, but appointing &s;uch as his fancy &s;ugge&s;ts to him. According to this Principle, two years ago he commanded the <HI>Nazer,</HI> who had vexed him to be expo&s;ed naked to the Sun; and the <HI>Nazer</HI> is one of the chief Officers of that Court: This was pre&s;ently put into execution, and he was expo&s;ed to the heat of the Sun, and the rage of flies, in the great place from Morning till Night, at which time the King di&s;charged him. Whil&s;t he was thus expo&s;ed no body minded him no more than if he had been a Dog, which was a great in&s;tance of the incon&s;tancy

of fortune, and of the friends &s;he gives; but both counterfeit and real friends have this excu&s;e, that on &s;uch occa&s;ions it is mo&s;t dangerous to render good Offices to a Man who is in di&s;grace with the King. He orders many times the Ears and No&s;e to be cut off: <HI>Schah Sefi</HI> heretofore inflicted that puni&s;hment the upon an Ancient Per&s;on of Quality, who had been in great fa|vour with the <HI>Great Schah Abbas</HI> his Predece&s;&s;our. This cruel Prince being angry with the good old man who was in his pre&s;ence,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Great barba|rity.</NOTE> commanded a Son of his to cut of his Ears, which that unnatural Son pre&s;ently executed; the King commanded him then to cut off his No&s;e, which was likewi&s;e done; with that the old man finding him&s;elf &s;o abu&s;ed by his own Son, and by order of his King whom he had not offended, but who acted merely in a bru|ti&s;h <HI>Capricio,</HI> &s;aid to the cruel Prince: Ah Sir, after this I ought not to live any longer, cau&s;e me to be put to death! He had no great trouble to obtain his de&s;ire; neverthele&s;s, that it might not &s;eem to be a favour to him, how inhumane &s;oever it was, the Prince, (as if he feared of being accu&s;ed this of Clemency in granting him death,) would needs accompany it with this piece of Cruelty, that his Son mu&s;t be the in&s;trument of that &s;ad Office, and the Executioner of his own Father: He bid his Son then, cut off his head, and told him that he gave him all his E&s;tate: This unnatural and infamous Parricide, without delay, obeyed that unju&s;t order, and cut the head from the Parent who had given him his Life.</P>
<P>It is remarkable, that the chief Per&s;ons of Court are not exempt from tho&s;e &s;torms, and that commonly they are the Objects of the&s;e cruel Sentences, and yet no body murmurs at it. Sometimes he is content to take part of their E&s;tates, &s;ometimes he takes all, and never fails to do &s;o when he puts them to di&s;grace. His neare&s;t Relations &s;oone&s;t feel the effects of this tyrannical Power: For the Kings of <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> are &s;o afraid of being deprived of that Power which they abu&s;e, and are &s;o apprehen&s;ive of being dethroned, that they de&s;troy the Children of their Female Relati|ons when they are brought to bed of Boys, by putting them into an Earthen trough where they &s;uffer them to &s;tarve; and when they come to the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Crown and Scepter, it is their fir&s;t Care, and fir&s;t Act of Royal Authority to cau&s;e the Eyes of all their Brothers, Uncles, Cou|&s;ins, Nephews and other Princes of their Bloud, barbarou&s;ly to be put out: which is done with the point of a <HI>Cangiar,</HI> wherewith the Eyes are pluck|ed out whole; and afterwards brought to the King in a Ba&s;on; and &s;ee|ing the Executioners of this Tyranny, are commonly the fir&s;t whom the King plea&s;es to &s;end on that errand, &s;ome of them are &s;o unskilfull at it, that they butcher them in &s;uch manner that &s;everal have thereby lo&s;t their Lives.</P>

<P>The King as he was going out ob&s;erving this new guard, failed not to ask what the meaning of it was; the <HI>Eatmad Doulet</HI> being there on purpo&s;e, an&s;wered that it was he who had placed tho&s;e guards there, for his Maje&s;ties &s;ecurity, becau&s;e the <HI>Divan Beghi</HI> &s;tirred up the People to &s;e|dition again&s;t him; pre&s;ently the King who was a little credulous, (which

That is an important Office, for he may oblige and di&s;oblige whom he plea&s;es, ha|ving the Princes ear, e&s;pecially if he be very young, for during a King's Mi|nority, the <HI>Mehter</HI> is in a manner &s;ole Governour: The word <HI>Mehter</HI> is a comparative in the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Language.

Neverthele&s;s, they had no good &s;ucce&s;s, which was partly occa&s;ioned by their own fault. They had made a very fal&s;e &s;tep at fir&s;t, acting at their fir&s;t coming what drew upon them the contempt which they met with at that Court all the while they &s;tayed there; for they made a pre&s;ent to the <HI>Eatmad Doulet,</HI> that they might obtain a permi&s;&s;ion to &s;ell the Commodities that they brought with them.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The pre&s;ents of the <HI>Mu&s;co|vites.</HI></NOTE> They had pretty fair pre&s;ents to make to the King, having brought with them a great many fine Furs and other Curio&s;ities of their Countrey, among&s;t which there was a Coach and a Falcon, which onely remained alive of many more that died by the way.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. XII.</HI> The continuation of the Ob&s;ervations of <HI>I&s;pahan.</HI> Of A&s;trologers, a Comet, an Eclip&s;e; and of the Super&s;tition of the <HI>Per&s;ians.</HI></HEAD>
<P>SInce there are A&s;trologers at the Court of <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> who have their quality of ordinary Officers, by the name of <HI>Munedgim,</HI> I thought it might not be ami&s;s to &s;ay &s;omething of them, after I had Treated of the Court.</P>
<P>A&s;trology is in &s;o great vogue in <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> that there it degenerates in Super&s;tition, and not only the Learned and men of Letters &s;ollicitou&s;ly apply them&s;elves to it, but even the common people and Soldiers tamper with it, and if a man can but Read, he fails not dayly to ob&s;erve the di&s;po&s;ition of the Planets, their A&s;pects, and their Conjunction or Oppo&s;ition; that he may &s;eem to be &s;omewhat among&s;t tho&s;e who have not the &s;ame knowledg. In Conver&s;ation all their Di&s;cour&s;e is of Spheres, Apogees, Perigees, Excentricks, Epicycles; and other &s;uch hard names, whereby they pretend to di&s;tingui&s;h them&s;elves from the Vulgar. It is very pro|bable that this pa&s;&s;ion among the people, proceeds not only from the Genius of the Nation; but al&s;o from a de&s;ire of imitating the Great ones: who are known to have always had in that Country a great propen&s;ity to tho&s;e kinds of Sciences, whether that their mind bent that way, Policy engaged them, or tho&s;e that pro|fe&s;&s;ed them, impo&s;ed upon their credulity or weakne&s;s, for their own intere&s;ts.</P>
<P>However it be, The Kings of <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> make great account of A&s;trologers, and the&s;e men who have a chief re&s;iding at Court, co&s;t them yearly va&s;t &s;ums of mony: and indeed, they undertake no bu&s;ine&s;s till fir&s;t they be informed by them of the lucky minute of &s;ome favourable Con&s;tellation, when they are to &s;et about it, and if a King hath had bad &s;ucce&s;s in any Affair, wherein he had not con&s;ulted them, all attribute the cau&s;e of it to the negligence of the Prince who omitted to nick the happy minute of the A&s;trologers. This cu&s;tom hath taken &s;uch root at Court, that the&s;e Gentlemen are become as nece&s;&s;ary as any other Officers thereof; and if the King have &s;en&s;e enough not to give credit to all their raveries, yet he mu&s;t &s;eem at lea&s;t to rely much upon them; becau&s;e under pretext of the good or bad minute, he orders his Affairs at his plea&s;ure, and no body murmurs at it, no not Strangers, with whom he never wants a fair pretext of refu&s;ing or granting their de&s;ires, telling them, (if they complain,) that it is the &s;uperiour power of the Stars which obliges him to act &s;o or &s;o.</P>
<P>Now I am &s;peaking of A&s;trology,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Comet at <HI>I&s;pahan.</HI></NOTE> I remember there appeared a Comet whil&s;t I was at <HI>I&s;pahan:</HI> The Reverend Father <HI>John Bapti&s;ta,</HI> a <HI>Capucin,</HI> di&s;covered it on <HI>Thur&s;day,</HI> the eleventh of <HI>December,</HI> one thou&s;and &s;ix hundred and &s;ixty four, about Five a Clock in the Morning, in the Sign of <HI>Virgo.</HI> It had a Tail, and moved from <HI>Ea&s;t</HI> to <HI>We&s;t:</HI> I &s;aw it on <HI>Monday</HI> the fifteenth of the &s;ame Month, about half an hour after five in the Morning, when it was almo&s;t in the Meridian, and about two degrees beyond the Sign of <HI>Virgo:</HI> its Tail appeared to the view about the length of a Fathom: Some days after the Tail of it pointed betwixt the <HI>We&s;t</HI> and the <HI>North.</HI> It pa&s;t from <HI>Virgo</HI> to <HI>Libra,</HI> and the one and twentieth of <HI>December,</HI> when it entered into <HI>Leo,</HI> there was a Conjunction of the <HI>Sun</HI> and <HI>Saturn;</HI> after that its Tail pointed <HI>Ea&s;tward.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Friday</HI> the &s;ixteenth of <HI>January,</HI> 1664/5. there happened an Eclip&s;e of the <HI>Sun,</HI> which began a little after eight of the Clock in the Morning, and la&s;ted almo&s;t till half an hour after Eleven, and two thirds of the <HI>Sun</HI> were well near Eclip&s;ed. The <HI>Mahometans</HI> have no publick Super&s;tition for an Eclip&s;e of the <HI>Sun;</HI> they only &s;ay a Prayer made on purpo&s;e; wherein they Pray God to avert all Calami|ties from them: But it is not the &s;ame in Eclip&s;es of the <HI>Moon,</HI> during which, as I have already &s;aid, they &s;pare not their Kettles. However it were no great mat|ter, if the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> were only Super&s;titious in relation to the Stars; they are &s;o

al&s;o in a thou&s;and trifles, which concern not at all A&s;trology. For in&s;tance, They will not eat any thing that a Chri&s;tian hath but touched, thinking it Pol|luted; and therefore they will not &s;uffer them to touch Fle&s;h, or any thing el&s;e that is Eatable,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> &s;u|per&s;tition.</NOTE> before they have bought it: if a Chri&s;tian drink in their Pot, they break it immediately, and it is very rare to &s;ee them lend one to any body: if a Peece mi&s;s firing, they are per&s;uaded that &s;ome Enemy hath laid a Charm upon it; and to cure the pretended Charm&punc; he that is to &s;hoot knocks the muzzle of his Peece again&s;t the ground, and then he thinks the Charm is &s;poilt, and that it will not mi&s;s again, though the defect he found proceeded only perhaps from the foulne&s;s of the Peece.</P>

The <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> hate the <HI>Turks</HI> no le&s;s, and hold them to be as impure as the Chri&s;tians, but dare not tell them &s;o as they do the Chri&s;tians, to whom there are &s;ome <HI>Moulas</HI> that will not &s;o much as teach the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Tongue for love nor mony, but there are others who are not &s;o &s;crupulous.</P>

<P>Upon the&s;e Principles of Religion, the Politicks of the Kings of <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> have firmly &s;ecured the Crown to all the De&s;cendants of the Race that &s;its at pre&s;ent upon the Throne: For they have made a &s;trong impre&s;&s;ion upon the minds of their people, that to have a true Title to Rule over them, one mu&s;t be De&s;cended of the Race of <HI>Aly,</HI> by one or other of the twelve <HI>Imams.

That which makes the quarrel greater, and gives occa&s;ion to bickerings, is that each quarter pretends to a certain part of the Camel,

More|over, there are two Factions in <HI>I&s;pahan,</HI> which always entertain great feuds betwixt them&s;elves, and that is the rea&s;on that they never meet in a Body, as in a Proce&s;&s;ion, but they fight till they kill one another: one of the&s;e Factions is called <HI>Aideri,</HI> and the other <HI>Naamet &V;llahi,</HI> from the names of two men, who commanded &s;ever|ally in the two Villages,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Factions of <HI>Aideri</HI> and <HI>Naamet Ulla|hi.</HI></NOTE> whereof <HI>I&s;pahan</HI> con&s;i&s;ts.

But to return to the Ceremony of the Camel, the piece that can be got, is di&s;tributed in each quar|ter, every Family hath a Portion of it, which they Boil, and then eat with a great deal of Devotion.

Not only in <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> but all over the <HI>Levant,</HI> they have a better Hoof than in our Countries, whether it be becau&s;e of the humi|dity of our Climate, or that we &s;hoe them to often. And indeed, the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> can &s;hoe a Hor&s;e with the fir&s;t Hor&s;e-&s;hoe they find, putting it forwards or backwards as much as is needful to fit it to the Foot, and they may Nail it in all places of the Hoof. In <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> they make their Hor&s;e-&s;hoes &s;mooth and flat:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hor&s;e &s;hoes in <HI>Per&s;ia.</HI></NOTE> &s;o that they have not little turnings up as ours have, which makes them continually &s;lide upon Stones, or upon the Ground when it is but in the lea&s;t wet. In <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> no more than in <HI>Turky</HI> they u&s;e no Manger to feed their Hor&s;es in; but whether it be in the Town or Country, they always feed them in a Bag of black Goats Hair,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The way of Feeding Hor&s;es.</NOTE> which they hang about their Neck. There are a great many Grooms who mingle Salt with the Barley they give them, to keep their Dung from &s;tinking: they put fir&s;t Straw in the bottom of the Sack, then two Handfuls of Salt, over that the Barley, and then mingle all together with the Hand. In the Spring they feed their Hor&s;es, Mules, and A&s;&s;es with Gra&s;s, and &s;o they do all over the <HI>Levant.</HI> They Curry them with a Comb that has no Handle, and only two ranks of Teeth, and they rub them with a piece of Felt.</P>
<P>In <HI>Turkie</HI> and <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> the Hor&s;es and Mules have &s;everal Di&s;ea&s;es,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Di&s;ea&s;es of Hor&s;es and Mules.</NOTE> of which there are &s;ome that are not known among us: for in&s;tance when they have eaten too much Barley, their Fore-Feet &s;well and become weak, &s;o that they ea&s;ily fall, and a kind of a Wen grows upon their Brea&s;t: that is to be cured with a hot Iron, putting them to Gra&s;s if it be in the Sea&s;on, and giving them no Barley for two or three days.</P>
<P>In the No&s;es of the Hor&s;es there grow al&s;o two Gri&s;tles, one on each &s;ide, which take Root at the end of the Bone of the No&s;e, upon the upper Jaw, and ri&s;e like Horns towards the No&s;e, under the Skin, through which they may ea&s;ily be &s;een: that puts them to &s;o great pain, that they will not feed, but only keep lying, and their Belly is &s;o &s;treight, that thy cannot goe but as if they were dragged; if one touch it, it &s;ounds like a Drum, and if care be not taken they die of it in two days: the remedy is to draw a &s;lit along their No&s;e, with a &s;harp pointed In&s;trument, to cut the&s;e two Cartilages, and make it as long as one can, and then they recover and are as good as ever they were: they call that Di&s;ea&s;e <HI>Nachan,</HI> that is to &s;ay the Nail.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nachan.</NOTE></P>
<P>They have a third Di&s;ea&s;e, which makes their Lips to &s;well, and that hinders them from Feeding; the remedy is to open a Vein in the Palat of the Mouth, with a Needle, or &s;ome &s;harp pointed In&s;trument. When they have Travelled for &s;ome time in Mire, or in Snow, or when their Feet have been too long in the Dirt, if care be not taken to make them clean, a little Scab grows upon the joint of the Foot, which draws in the Sinew, and hinders them from going: to cure that, they apply to it Gun powder and Snow, if they have any, and if they have none, Gun powder alone.</P>
<P>Sometimes a blacki&s;h water breeds in their Hoof, and that Di&s;ea&s;e in <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> is called <HI>Ab&s;iah,</HI> that is to &s;ay, black water: the remedy is to take off the &s;hoo, pare the Hoof, and apply the Oil of Naphta to the place.</P>

<P>They have be&s;ides another evil, which is an Excre&s;cence that grows upon the Joynt of the Foot, which makes them cut in going; this proceeds from &s;trains they have had when they were young: and it is to be Cured by a hot Iron.</P>

They make Wine al&s;o of other &s;orts of Grapes, which is neither &s;o good, nor keeps &s;o well. They have &s;ome Red Wine, but little, and to make it, they only put &s;ome Black Grapes into White Wine, to give it a colour: if it were made of Black Grapes it would not keep: we mu&s;t except the Wine of <HI>Schiras,</HI> which is Red, very good, and Stomachical:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Schiras</HI> Wine.</NOTE> but it is only brought in Bottles, and one mu&s;t have Friends for that too; if neverthele&s;s an <HI>Ar|menian</HI> hath got any of it, he &s;ells it at eight <HI>Aba&s;&s;is,</HI> and at the lea&s;t at &s;ix.

<P>Though the <HI>Per&s;ians,</HI> as I have now &s;aid, have all the kinds of Fruit that we have, yet they have not the &s;everal &s;orts of them.

They Eat Melons almo&s;t all the year round, not only becau&s;e they take much pains in Cultivating of them, but al&s;o by rea&s;on of the Nature of the Air, that I have &s;poke of, which neverthele&s;s excu&s;es not tho&s;e who would pre&s;erve their Melons well, from having always a Candle burning in the Room where they lay them, whether it be to keep them from the damp, or from being Frozen. In this manner they Cultivate them; in the fir&s;t place they make u&s;e of a great deal of Pigeons Dung,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The rai&s;ing of Melons.</NOTE> keeping Pigeons only for that purpo&s;e, which they put into the Ground where they Sow the Melons, and that Dung is &s;old by weight. When the Melons are above Ground, and begin to be &s;haped into a Stalk that will carry, &s;ometimes twenty, they take off three or four, and leave tho&s;e which thrive be&s;t: ten or twelve days after, they again take off tho&s;e that thrive wor&s;t, which (although they are &s;o little,) &s;ell very well about Town; for there are tho&s;e who Eat them; and in this manner they always ea&s;e the Stem, leaving only tho&s;e which thrive be&s;t, till, at length, there remain no more but one: It is to be ob&s;erved that every time they open a little with their Nails the Earth that is about the Root, they fill it up with Pigeons Dung, to give it new nouri&s;hment; then they put water to it by means of &s;ome little Channels that have many turnings, which water the Roots without weting the Fruit. They u&s;e all the&s;e ways with them three or four times, for having watered them, they let them alone eight or ten days without giving them any more water; at length, when the remaining Melon begins to grow big, they put the end of it to their mouth, and having wet it a little with their Spittle, cover it with a parcel of Earth, and they &s;ay that this Ce|remony pre&s;erves them from the bitings of &s;ome Flies, that el&s;e would &s;poil them. In <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> they Eat Melons till the month of <HI>April,</HI> nay &s;ome al&s;o in <HI>May,</HI> which is about the time they begin to Eat new ones: at lea&s;t in <HI>July</HI> they begin to have them Ripe, but they are &s;mall round Melons, mo&s;t of them white within, &s;oft like Cotton, and of no reli&s;h; tho&s;e that are good, are not fit to be Eaten before <HI>Au|gu&s;t;</HI> they are of another kind, and mo&s;t part long: I have de&s;cribed them before.</P>

<P><PB N="117" REF="228">The <HI>Armenians</HI> call that Plant <HI>Badi&s;amour,</HI> but one of them very rationally told me, that they had no rea&s;on to give it the name of that Pe&s;tiferous Wind, and far le&s;s to attribute to it the cau&s;e of the bad effects thereof, &s;eeing the &s;ame Plant is found in many places, where the <HI>Badi&s;amour</HI> Wind rages not; as at <HI>Lar,</HI> and beyond it, and that Wind rages only from <HI>Conve&s;ton</HI> to <HI>Bender;</HI> Nay many people of <HI>Schiras</HI> told me that the Plant is to be found two Leagues from that Town, where that Wind rages not, and I have &s;een it in many places upon the Road from <HI>Carzerum</HI> to <HI>Benderick.</HI> This is a good rea&s;on to prove that that Plant cau&s;es not the afore&s;aid Wind, but it does not &s;ufficiently prove, that with that Wind it does not cau&s;e the&s;e bad effects; for it may very well be &s;aid, that if that hot Wind reigned in places where there were no &s;uch Plant, it would not, perhaps, be &s;o mortal, becau&s;e it may be, that being already very bad of it &s;elf, the malignity of it is encrea&s;ed by pa&s;&s;ing over the&s;e Plants, who&s;e &s;mell and noxious qualities it carries along with it; but what in my opinion, may &s;erve to convince us of the contrary; betwixt <HI>Mo&s;ul</HI> and <HI>Bagdad</HI> there being no &s;uch Plants, (at lea&s;t I never &s;aw, nor heard there were any) the Wind which in tho&s;e quarters is called the <HI>Samiel</HI> is as pe&s;tiferous and mortal there, as in the places where that Plant is to be found; it is therefore impertinent to attibute to it the bad effects of that Wind, and the rather that that Plant grows all over the Indies, where it is not known what the Wind <HI>Samiel</HI> is.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides what the <HI>Armenian</HI> told me that that Plant is called <HI>Kerzehreh,</HI> that is to &s;ay, A&s;&s;es-Gall, for the rea&s;on alleadged before, I found in a Dictionary <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> and <HI>Per&s;ian,</HI> that <HI>Kerzehreh</HI> &s;ignifies be&s;ides, a Tree of Poy&s;on, and that man a&s;|&s;ured me that it was Poy&s;onous, if but &s;melt too. But he gave an Original to the Wind <HI>Badi&s;amour</HI> that had no &s;oliditie at all; for he &s;aid that it blew from the Sea,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A bad cau&s;e of the <HI>Badi|&s;amour.</HI></NOTE> and that upon that Coa&s;t the Sea often ca&s;ts a &s;hoar a kind of a Fi&s;h, whereof he could not tell the name, and that that Fi&s;h being out of the Sea dies and corrupts, &s;o that the Wind pa&s;&s;ing over it brings along with it that &s;tench which renders it pe&s;tiferous. A <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> Gentleman who lived for &s;everal years at <HI>Bender Congo,</HI> near which are many <HI>Kerzehreh</HI> Trees, told me this particular of it;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Some particu|larities of the <HI>Kerzehreh.</HI></NOTE> that that part of its Root which looks to the Ea&s;t is Poy&s;on, and that that which looks to the South is the Antidote; and that of the Wood of that Plant they make good Coals for Gun-powder.</P>
<P>We found be&s;ides in many places,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Konar,</HI> a Tree.</NOTE> and chiefly all a long the Road from <HI>Dgiaroun</HI> to <HI>Benderaba&s;&s;i,</HI> a Tree which they call <HI>Konar:</HI> the Trunk of it is &s;o big that it will require two men to gra&s;p it round; two or three Foot high, it looks ju&s;t like a Rock, or like many Roots twi&s;ted together, and is very knotty and whiti&s;h; as to the re&s;t both in &s;hape and height it much re&s;embles a Pear-Tree; the Branches of it &s;pread far, and make a great &s;hade: the Bark of them is white, as well as the in&s;ide, which hath a Pith in the Heart like an Elder-Tree; at all the knots where little Branches or Leaves &s;prout out, there are two large long prickles, which are &s;trong and red, bending a little down towards the ground, and are not directly oppo&s;ite to one another. The Leaves are of the length and breadth that are marked in the following Figure.</P>
<P>They are of a varni&s;hed green colour on the one &s;ide, and on the other of a pale and whiti&s;h green, and have Veins like Plantain Leaves. This Tree bears a Fruit which is ripe in <HI>March,</HI> and in &s;hape much re&s;embles a little Apple, of the &s;ame colour, but no bigger than a Service, or &s;mall Cherry. There is little of it to be Eaten, for the &s;tone is much bigger than that of a Cherry. and is very hard and round, &s;o that there is hardly any thing but a skin over the &s;tone. The Fruit be|ing ripe is wrinkly and inclining to an Orange-colour; it is pretty &s;weet but woolly; I believe it grows in <HI>Italy</HI> by the name of <HI>Azzarole,</HI> and is perhaps the Rhamnus,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><P>Azzarole. <HI>Rhamnus,</HI> Folio &s;ub ro|tundo.</P>

<P>Among&s;t Plants there is a certain Herb in <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> called <HI>Livas,</HI> which hath a very curled Leaf, &s;omewhat like a Beet, or like curled Coleworts, but it is much more curled; the &s;talk of it is like the &s;talk of an Artichoak, and is very &s;harp; they Eat of it in the Spring as a delicious food; many will have it to be the <HI>Rhuebarb,</HI> but it is not.</P>

<P>AFTER almo&s;t five Months &s;tay at <HI>I&s;pahan,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Departure from <HI>I&s;pahan.</HI></NOTE> I made ready to con|tinue my Travels forwards; and parted from thence the four and twentieth day of <HI>February,</HI> 1664/5. with a Caravan, wherein there were about fifty Mules, a great part of them belonging to <HI>Mon&s;ieur Tavernier,</HI> and the re&s;t to <HI>Armenians,</HI> who took the occa&s;ion of our going. We took Mules for our Goods, at the rate of five <HI>Aba&s;&s;is,</HI> for an hundred <HI>Mans</HI> of <HI>Tauris:</HI> for our &s;elves we had Hor&s;es; for the Muletors &s;crupuled to let us have Mules to Ride on: however they were obliged to &s;pare one for my Servant, who carried part of my things with him; for they reckon a man but for thirty <HI>Mans,</HI> comprehending therein four or five <HI>Mans</HI> of Bagage. We &s;et out then from <HI>Giolfa Tue&s;day</HI> at Noon, and pa&s;t by <HI>Hezar Dgirib,</HI> taking our way &s;treight <HI>Ea&s;t;</HI> at One of the Clock we Encamped by a <HI>Kervan&s;eray,</HI> called <HI>Tahhtpoulad,</HI> and <HI>Ba|baruk,</HI> which is near the burying place of the <HI>Mahometans.</HI></P>
<P>We parted from that place the &s;ame day,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tahhtpoulad, Babaruk.</NOTE> half an hour after Nine of the Clock at Night, and held our way &s;treight <HI>South-Ea&s;t,</HI> over a Plain, which at the entry is &s;treightned a little by Hills on both &s;ides, and then opens into a pretty large Champain; there grows not one Pile of Gra&s;s in it, and in &s;ome places there are great pieces of white Earth of Natural Salt. This Salt is made of Rain-water,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Natural Salt.</NOTE> which incorpo|rating with that Salinous Earth, produces a Salt, that works out of the Surface of it.

that is to &s;ay Stairs; it is not high, but yet very difficult to get up, being all &s;teps in a very &s;lippery Rock, which hath given it that name: we were a full half hour in that pa&s;&s;age, not only becau&s;e it behoved us to goe one by one, but al&s;o becau&s;e &s;everal Mules fell and threw their burdens, which we mu&s;t load again; and all this by Star-light, which in <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> commonly &s;hine &s;o clear that one may Travel by them even when there is no Moon-&s;hine: we afterwards continued Travelling among&s;t Hills till it was day. that we entered into a great Plain, as barren as the former, wherein we marched on till half an hour after Eight, when being arrived at a Village called <HI>Mayar,</HI> we Lodged in a <HI>Kervan&s;eray;</HI> this place is eight long <HI>Agat&s;ch</HI> from <HI>Babaruk.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Mayar</HI> is a ruinated Village, which was formerly of note, and had many Gardens about it that produced plenty of Fruit; but &s;ome years &s;ince an <HI>Eatmad Doulet</HI> cut off their water, to bring it all into a Garden which he had in tho&s;e Quarters; &s;o that &s;ince that time, nothing Grows there, and they bring what they want from other Villages: nor have they any other water to drink but what they get out of a great Pool hard by:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Mayar</HI> is the beginning of the Country of <HI>Fars</HI> or real <HI>Per&s;ia.

Half an hour after Nine we pa&s;&s;ed through a little Village called <HI>Schairza,</HI> where there is much Sowed Land, and many Gardens: in one of tho&s;e Gardens there is a Pond of Spring-water, which falls down from the Hills that are over it; it is &s;o full of Fi&s;h, that from thence the Garden hath taken the name of <HI>Hhaouz-Mahi,</HI> which &s;ignifies a Fi&s;h-Pond; but there is a <HI>Dervi&s;h</HI> that hinders people from catching them.

<P>We parted from thence next day, being <HI>Friday</HI> the &s;even and twentieth of <HI>Fe|bruary,</HI> at Three a Clock in the Morning; but no &s;ooner were we gone, but we were forced to turn back again, becau&s;e there was a <HI>Chan</HI> upon the Road, going to <HI>Schiras</HI> with his <HI>Haram,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The meeting of a <HI>Chan</HI> with his <HI>Haram.</HI></NOTE> (that is to &s;ay his women;) and therefore we could not goe on, for the jealous <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> fuffer no man to come near the Road where there women are. So then we came back, and having fetched many compa&s;&s;es about another way, three quarters of an hour after we fell into the High-way again, which was &s;till a Plain, and we kept on marching &s;till almo&s;t South wards, but with a piercing cold Wind; we found &s;everal Brooks on our way, and the ground being pretty good in that Country, &s;o &s;oon as it was day we &s;aw &s;ome Villages on our Right Hand, and about Nine of the Clock arrived near to a Village called <HI>Mak|&s;oud Beghi,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Mak&s;oud Be|ghi.</NOTE> five <HI>Agat&s;ch</HI> di&s;tant from <HI>Kom&s;chah,</HI> we Lodged in a new <HI>Kervan&s;eray,</HI> that of the Village being demoli&s;hed.</P>
<P>Next Morning about a quarter after Two of the Clock, we &s;et forward on our Journey again, over the &s;ame Plain we had the day before; at break of day we pa&s;&s;ed by a little Ca&s;tle built of Stone, with &s;ome round Towers, where there is a Village hard by with Gardens and a <HI>Kervan&s;eray:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Amnebad.</NOTE> that place is called <HI>Amnebad;</HI> it is di&s;tant from <HI>Mak&s;oud-Beghi</HI> three <HI>Agat&s;ch,</HI> and as far from <HI>Yez-de-Ka&s;t.</HI> This Ca&s;tle was built by <HI>Imam-Couli-Chan,</HI> who was <HI>Chan</HI> of <HI>Schiras</HI> in time of the great <HI>Schah-Abbas.</HI> Keeping on our way, about Eleven of the Clock we arrived at <HI>Yez-de-Ka&s;t,</HI> a little Town or Burrough, three <HI>Agat&s;ch</HI> di&s;tant from <HI>Amnebad,</HI> and &s;ix from <HI>Mak&s;oud-Beghi;</HI> we went and Lodged in a <HI>Kervan&s;eray</HI> a little be|yond it.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Tez-de-Ka&s;t.</NOTE><HI>Yez-de Ka&s;t</HI> is very little, having but only one Street; it is built upon a narrow Rock, which &s;tretches out in length from <HI>North-Ea&s;t</HI> to <HI>South-We&s;t;</HI> this Rock is very &s;teep, &s;o that it is almo&s;t as broad on the top as at the bottom, e&s;pecially on the <HI>North-We&s;t</HI> &s;ide; it is in &s;ome places above &s;even or eight Fathom high, particularly on the <HI>South-Ea&s;t</HI> &s;ide: at the Foot of this Rock on the &s;ame <HI>South-Ea&s;t</HI> &s;ide, there are &s;ome Gardens, and &s;ome &s;teps farther runs a little River, near to which is the <HI>Kervan&s;eray,</HI> built of burnt Bricks; and over the Gate there is a pretty con|venient Lodging-Hou&s;e; it &s;tands at the Foot of a high Rock that is to the <HI>South</HI> of it, from which &s;ometimes great pieces fall, and are to be &s;een below, mo&s;t of them be|ing as big as Hou&s;es. The Village of <HI>Yez-de-Ka&s;t,</HI> takes up the whole Surface of
<PB N="121" REF="230">
the Rock on which it &s;tands, as well in length as in breadth; it hath no other Walls but the Walls of the Hou&s;es, which are three or four Stories high, and &s;ome higher, all built of Stone. This Town is in manife&s;t danger &s;ometime or other of falling down top&s;ie turvy all at once, being &s;o high, and having nothing to &s;upport it: and indeed, the Inhabitants mi&s;tru&s;t it, for about ten years &s;ince they began to build another Town, at &s;ome di&s;tance from the Rock, and to the North|ward of it; and when I pa&s;&s;ed by it on my return, in the Year one thou&s;and &s;ix hundred &s;ixty and &s;even, a great many Hou&s;es were already fini&s;hed, and new ones going up, all for&s;aking the other Seat; whereas when I pa&s;t it fir&s;t, in the Year one thou&s;and &s;ix hundred &s;ixty five, there was not &s;o much as one Hou&s;e begun.</P>
<P>The Gate of <HI>Yez-de-Ka&s;t</HI> is on the <HI>South-We&s;t</HI> &s;ide, where the ground about is as high as the Rock; it is but little, &s;o that not having ob&s;erved it at fir&s;t coming, I went from the <HI>Kervan&s;eray</HI> to the Town, climbing up the Rock on the <HI>South-Ea&s;t</HI> &s;ide betwixt the Gardens; and after much climbing up, I entered by a little Gate, and went on above a hundred &s;teps in a covered way that receives no light but by ugly holes, and is by con&s;equence &s;o dark, that one mu&s;t groap along as they go in it. I dur&s;t proceed no farther for fear of lo&s;ing my &s;elf, or entering into &s;ome Hou&s;e by mi&s;take, and &s;o for that time I was obliged to turn back again, by the &s;ame way I came: but it is not &s;o when one enters the Town by the other Gate.</P>
<P>The Land about <HI>Yez-de-Ka&s;t</HI> bears the be&s;t Corn in <HI>Per&s;ia;</HI> and indeed, they make mo&s;t excellent Bread there: the Inhabitants, (as they &s;ay,) mingling dry Pea&s;e with the Corn, which makes the Bread &s;o good. There are &s;everal fair Tombs here, built in Fa&s;hion of Domes.</P>
<P><HI>Sunday</HI> the fir&s;t of <HI>March</HI> we parted from that place, half an hour after midnight, and took the upper way, for there are two ways, the one on the Left Hand Ea&s;t-wards, which is called the lower way, and the other on the Right Hand to the <HI>We&s;t</HI> &s;ide, which they call the upper way, becau&s;e it lies among Hills: in the Win|ter-time when this way is filled up with Snow, they are obliged to go the lower way, which is the longer by a days Journy: but being a&s;&s;ured that the upper way was open, we took it, and for that end, when we &s;et out from the <HI>Kervan&s;eray,</HI> we held We&s;tward for &s;ome time, till we came to a place where the way leads up that Hill, at the Foot whereof the <HI>Kervan&s;eray</HI> &s;tands; being got up we marched in a Plain betwixt little Hills covered with Snow, &s;treight <HI>South-Ea&s;t,</HI> until about Three a Clock, we mounted up a Hill, where the a&s;cent is not long, and the de&s;cent &s;horter, but the way very bad; and therefore it is called <HI>Chotali-Naar-Schekeni,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Chotali-Naar-Schekeni.</NOTE> (that is to &s;ay,) the Hill that pulls off the Hor&s;es &s;hoes: we came afterward into a pretty good way betwixt little Hills all white with Snow: at day break we pa&s;&s;ed by a little Ca&s;tle called <HI>Gombez-Cala;</HI> where there is a Village al&s;o but ruined.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gombez-Cala.</NOTE> Half an hour after Nine we entered into a Plain in which we Travelled on till after Ele|ven that we came to a Village, where we Lodged in a <HI>Kervan&s;eray.</HI> This Village is called <HI>Dehi ghirdon,</HI> (that is to &s;ay,) Village of Nuts,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dehi ghirdon.</NOTE> not that it abounds in that Fruit, for having informed my &s;elf, I learnt that the Nuts they eat there come from <HI>Lar;</HI> however I took the pains to ask the rea&s;on why it was &s;o called, but all the an&s;wer I could get, was that that was the name of it: it is &s;even <HI>Agat&s;ch</HI> di&s;tant from <HI>Yez-de-Ka&s;t.</HI></P>

<P>Next Morning about half an hour after Four we went on our Journey, and Travelled in a way covered with Snow, and full of holes: but we found it wor&s;e when the Sun was up, and the ground began to Thaw, e&s;pecially about Eleven of the Clock when we entered among&s;t the Hills, which being full of Dirt and Stones, made the way as bad as it could be. This pa&s;&s;age makes that they goe not that way in the Winter-time, for in the Summer all the&s;e ways are good; we kept on always a&s;cending a little till about One a Clock, that we went down Hill a good way, at the the bottom of that de&s;cent a great Brook ri&s;es out of the Ground, a good Fa|thom in breadth, the water whereof is very clear; this Brook runs by a Village called <HI>A&s;oupas,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">A&s;oupas.</NOTE> where we arrived half an hour after two in the afternoon, and there we were very ill Lodged in a na&s;ty <HI>Kervan&s;erai;</HI> this Village is five <HI>Agat&s;ch</HI> di&s;tant from <HI>Keu&s;chkzer;</HI> and has a &s;orry old ruinous Ca&s;tle upon a little Hill: the Inha|bitants are <HI>Circa&s;&s;ians,</HI> who were Tran&s;ported thither, as well as tho&s;e of <HI>Keu&s;chkzer</HI> by <HI>Schah Abbas,</HI> who took their Country, and gave them good Lands to Culti|vate in this place; they make Wine, but their Grapes come from <HI>Maain.</HI></P>

We marched on through a Plain, in good way, until Noon, when having pa&s;&s;ed over a Bridge of &s;even Arches, under which a River runs;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Oudgioun.</NOTE> we came to a Village called <HI>Oudgioun,</HI> four <HI>Agat&s;ch</HI> from <HI>A&s;ou|pas:</HI> we found a <HI>Kervan&s;erai</HI> there, but it &s;tank &s;o by rea&s;on of the great quantity of Carrion and filth that was in it, that we could not Lodge therein, &s;o that we were fain to encamp hard by under Carpets, which we pitched in&s;tead of Tents. A River fix or &s;even Fathom over runs through this Village, the water of it is very muddy, and has a Bridge of &s;even &s;mall Arches over: there is Wine al&s;o in this place, and the Grapes are brought from <HI>Maain.</HI> Within a Mo&s;que there, lyes Enterred the Son of a King,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Schah-Zadeh-Imam-Dgiafer.</NOTE> called <HI>Scbah Zadeh-Imam-Dgiafer,</HI> whom they reckon a Saint, the <HI>Dome</HI> is rough ca&s;t over: before the Mo&s;que there is a Court well Planted with many high Plane-Trees, on which we &s;aw a great many Storks, that haunt thereabout all the year round.</P>
<P>We parted from <HI>Oudgioun, Thur&s;day</HI> the fifth of <HI>March,</HI> half an hour after two in the Morning; and having advanced a quarter of an hour through Grounds full of water, we had the way good, till half an hour after Four, that we went up an extraordinary high and unea&s;ie Hill, becau&s;e of the &s;tones that lay in the way: it is called <HI>Chotal-Imam-Zadeh-I&s;mael,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Chotal-Imam-Zadeh-I&s;mael.</NOTE> (that is to &s;ay,) the Hill of <HI>I&s;mael,</HI> the Son of an <HI>Imam;</HI> and we were above an hour in mounting it. We found on the top a great many Camels coming from <HI>Schiras,</HI> loaded with Tabacco, which is brought from <HI>Beban:</HI> after that for above two hours we went down Hill in pretty good way, &s;ave that here and there we met with &s;ome &s;tones; one would have thought that we had changed the Climate when we came to the top of the Hill, for the &s;ide by which we came up was all covered with Snow, and on this &s;ide there was none at all; on the contrary, it was full of wild Almond-Trees, that bear a bitter Fruit, and other Trees, which with their Verdure, delighted the &s;ight. When we were a good way down, we came to a Mo&s;que where that <HI>I&s;mael,</HI> the Son of <HI>Imam,</HI> who gives the name to the Hill, is Enterred. The out&s;ide of that place looks like a Ca&s;tle, with a round Tower at each corner; within there is a Court, at one end of which is the Mo&s;que who&s;e Fronti&s;piece is a Portico &s;ix Arches in length, and in the middle of the Mo&s;que, there is a <HI>Dome</HI> rough ca&s;t: clo&s;e by it is a Village with a great many Gardens, watered by a lovely Brook that runs hard by. We then continued our Journy in &s;tony way, till Eleven a Clock, that we found a River about a Fathom and a half over, which divides it &s;elf into many Rivulets, that water all the Grounds thereabout, being very good Land and all &s;owed.

River is the &s;econd <HI>Araxes</HI> of <HI>Quintus Curtius, Diodorus Siculus,</HI> and <HI>Strabo.</HI> We kept along the &s;ide of it, and cro&s;&s;ed many of its Canals, until about one of the Clock, we arrived at a large Village called <HI>Main,</HI> fix <HI>Agat&s;ch</HI> from <HI>Oudgioun.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Main.</NOTE> We Lodged in a good <HI>Kervan&s;erai,</HI> where we found &s;ome men who accompanied to <HI>Mecha</HI> the body of a Lady, who had de&s;ired to be buried there. There are many Gardens all round this Village, full of Vines, that bear good Grapes, and abounding al&s;o in Pear-Trees, Peach-Trees, Walnuts and other Fruit-Trees, with water-Melons and other Melons.</P>
<P>We parted from <HI>Main, Friday,</HI> the &s;ixth of <HI>March,</HI> half an hour after two in the Morning, and pre&s;ently left the High-way, &s;triking to the left over Sowed Ground, till we got near to the River; we were obliged to do &s;o, becau&s;e the High-way would have led us to a place where the River was not Foardable, and they take not that way but when it may be Foarded over; the other way leads to a Bridge: we followed the current of the River, which is the &s;ame that runs by <HI>Main,</HI> until half an hour after Three, that we cro&s;&s;ed over the Bridge, con&s;i&s;ting of three Arches, but the middlemo&s;t a very large one, under which the water is very rapid, a quarter of an hour after we found a great Brook, that falling from the Hill di&s;charges it &s;elf in the River; a little farther on we &s;aw upon the River a Bridge broken down, and a quarter of an hour after the ruins of another Bridge: in this place there are a great many &s;mall Brooks, that lo&s;e them&s;elves in the River, we then went forwards in good Way till day, that we began to a&s;cend a little. In the&s;e Quarters is the Hill which <HI>Alexander</HI> the Great made him&s;elf Ma&s;ter of by &s;tratagem, &s;ending Soldiers by a compa&s;s about to &s;urpri&s;e the Enemies on their back, whil&s;t he Attacked them on the Front, as <HI>Quintus Curtius</HI> relates it: a <HI>Franck</HI> &s;hewed me one &s;eparated from the re&s;t, which he &s;aid was the very &s;ame, but there was little probability in that, becau&s;e there are a great many &s;uch thereabouts, and it is very difficult to pitch upon the right; be&s;ides I did not &s;ee how it could command the Pa&s;&s;age, which is too wide in that place, to be Locked in by Mountains. About Eight of the Clock we came to a Bridge built over the River of <HI>Main,</HI> or <HI>Bendemir,</HI> which at that place is at lea&s;t nine or ten Fathom broad. This is a rapid River, and &s;eems to be deep, the water of it is thick, and &s;wells high in <HI>Winter;</HI> for they a&s;&s;ured me that then it &s;welled up as high as the Bridge, which con&s;i&s;ts of five Arches, but &s;omewhat ruinous; neverthele&s;s it is called <HI>Pouli-Now,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Pouli-Now.</HI> New-Bridge.</NOTE> that is to &s;ay the New Bridge: having pa&s;&s;ed it and left a way on our Right Hand, we took to the Left, and having Travelled on an hour and a half more in a Plain, till about half an hour after nine, we Encamped near to a <HI>Kervan&s;erai</HI> that was a building, a Rich man of <HI>Schiras</HI> having left by Will money for that purpo&s;e. That place is called <HI>Abgherm,</HI> which &s;ignifies hot water,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Abgherm.</NOTE> becau&s;e the water there is a little warm; it gave &s;ome of our Company a loo&s;ene&s;s; but has plenty of Fi&s;h in it. This place, which is but four <HI>Agat&s;ch</HI> from <HI>Main:</HI> was but half of our u&s;ual days Journey: however our Bea&s;ts being tired, we &s;tayed there till next day the &s;eventh of <HI>March,</HI> when we parted half an hour after Two in the Morning, and put on before the Caravan, that we might get to <HI>Schiras</HI> the &s;ame day.</P>
<P>There are &s;everal ways that lead to it, but we kept &s;till to the Left, cro&s;&s;ing over many Brooks; about half an hour after &s;ix we came to a Cau&s;ey, above two Fathom broad, and two thou&s;and Paces long, all well Paved, with Arches in &s;everal places, and chiefly in the middle, where there is a Bridge an hundred Paces in length, un|der which runs a &s;mall branch of the River of <HI>Main;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Poligorgh.</NOTE> that Cau&s;ey is called <HI>Poli|gorgh.</HI> Half an hour after Seven we &s;aw a &s;orry <HI>Kervan&s;erai;</HI> but a little beyond it there is a very good one, which is extraordinary large and well built, with many embelli&s;hments; at each corner there is a little Tower, the Gate is fair and high, adorned with many pieces of Marble, on which there are In&s;criptions.

Having Travelled near two hours in very &s;tony way, and cro&s;&s;ed &s;everal lovely Brooks, about Five a Clock at night we came to a place from whence there is a very plea&s;ant pro&s;pect of the City; for two Hills there drawing near together at the end, make a narrow pa&s;&s;age, beyond which are Gardens full of lovely Cypre&s;&s;es; and then the Town, which lyes in a Plain from <HI>North</HI> to <HI>South;</HI> &s;o that it yields a mo&s;t delightful pro&s;pect: After we had a little advanced betwixt tho&s;e two Hills, we &s;aw a great Re&s;erva|tory of water, which is pretty ruinous; the water is &s;topt by a thick Wall, almo&s;t two Fathom broad, &s;upported by two &s;purs of the &s;ame thickne&s;s, which with the Wall from the bottom of the Ditch are almo&s;t three Fathom high; the Re&s;ervatory was formerly much of the &s;ame depth, but is at pre&s;ent almo&s;t filled up with the Earth that the water has brought into it: the Wall hath been made to &s;erve for a Bank to &s;top the waters that in Winter fall from the Hills, and running too vio|lently through that &s;treight, beat down all that &s;tood in their way, but it is dry in the Summer-time;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Arrival at <HI>Schiras.</HI></NOTE> at length we came to the City-Gate, which is fair and well built.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. II.</HI> Of <HI>Schiras.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE fir&s;t thing we found upon our entry into <HI>Schiras</HI> was a great broad Street, on each &s;ide bordered by Gardens, with little pretty neat Hou&s;es over the Gates of them: having advanced in that Street about a quarter of an hour, we came to a large Stone-Ba&s;on full of water, and of an Oblong Figure, being about twenty or twenty five Fathom in length, and more than fifteen in breadth. Continuing in the &s;ame Street, you &s;ee a lovely Mo&s;que who&s;e Dome is covered with blew Varni&s;hed Tiles. Joyning to this Mo&s;que there is a burying-place Planted with fair Trees, with a round Stone-Ba&s;on full of water, which renders the place very plea|&s;ant: &s;o that there are always people taking the Air in it, with their Pipes of To|bacco: a little farther there is a Bridge of five Arches, under which runs a &s;mall River; and onward in the &s;ame Street you come to a covered <HI>Bazar</HI> that puts an end to it: this Street is but as a Suburbs to the City, which at that place begins. We &s;truck off to the Left and alighted at the little Hou&s;e of the Reverend Fa|thers <HI>Carmelites,</HI> where all the <HI>Francks</HI> goe.</P>
<P>The City of <HI>Schiras,</HI> heretofore <HI>Schir&s;az,</HI> and which many will have to be <HI>Cyropolis,</HI> is properly the Metropolis of the Province of <HI>Per&s;ia;</HI> it lyes in a mo&s;t plea&s;ant and fertile Plain, that yields the be&s;t Wine in <HI>Per&s;ia.</HI> On the <HI>Ea&s;t</HI> it is at the Foot of a Hill covered with &s;everal &s;orts of Fruit-Trees, among&s;t which are many Orange and Limon-Trees, intermingled with Cypre&s;&s;es: it is about two hours walk in Circumference,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Circum|ference of <HI>Schiras.</HI></NOTE> and lyes from <HI>North</HI> to <HI>South;</HI> it hath no Walls, but only a &s;curvy Ditch, and that is all it needs, having no Enemies to be afraid of: it is watered by a River, which is but little, and yet &s;ubject to overflowings; when that happens, the Inhabitants hinder it from breaking into their Gardens, and carrying away their Walls, by ca&s;ting up Dykes to &s;top it: they make them with <HI>Couffes,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Couffes.</NOTE> that is to &s;ay, great Panniers made of brui&s;ed Canes, like Palm-Tree-Leaves, which they fill with Earth and Stone, and that hinders the pa&s;&s;age of the water very well. The Streets of <HI>Schiras</HI> are for the mo&s;t part &s;omewhat narrow,
<PB N="125" REF="232">
though there be &s;ome fair ones, having in the middle lovely Canals, bordered with Stone, through which a very clear Rivulet runs. There are a great many fair co|vered <HI>Bazars</HI> long and broad, with great Shops on each &s;ide, well furni&s;hed with all &s;orts both of <HI>Indian</HI> and <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Commodities; and every Commodity hath its particular <HI>Bazar.</HI> It hath many large well built <HI>Kervan&s;erays:</HI> as to the Palaces, they make no &s;hew on the out&s;ide, no more than in the re&s;t of the <HI>Levant,</HI> but all their beauty is within: the Palace of the <HI>Chan</HI> him&s;elf looks but mean, and no|thing appears outwards but a body of Lodgings over the Gate, which is at the end of a great Square long <HI>Meidan,</HI> with Arches all round it, filled up in the manner of Niches. There are &s;ome lovely Mo&s;ques in it al&s;o;<NOTE PLACE="marg">A College at <HI>Schiras.</HI></NOTE> and a fair College with a round Tower on each &s;ide of the Gate faced with blew varni&s;hed earth, but they are half ruined, having thrice &s;uffered Fire, which as often &s;eized a Neighbouring <HI>Bazar.</HI> In that College there are Profe&s;&s;ors who have Salaries for teaching Theology, Philo&s;ophy, and Medicine;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Publick Pro|fe&s;&s;ors.</NOTE> and I was told that there were above five hundred Students in it.</P>
<P>But the plea&s;ante&s;t thing to be &s;een about <HI>Schiras,</HI> are the Gardens,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lovely Gardens at <HI>Schiras.</HI></NOTE> which are many: among&s;t the re&s;t, the Kings Gardens are worth the &s;eeing. They are &s;paci|ous, and have long &s;treight Walks &s;haded with &s;tately large Cypre&s;s-Trees; (for &s;ome of them are the highe&s;t and bu&s;hie&s;t that ever I &s;aw,) &s;o that into &s;ome of the&s;e Allies the Sun does not &s;hine a quarter of an hour in a day. You have there al&s;o abundance of lovely great Maple-Trees, planted in rows, with many Fruit-Trees: Rivulets run there on all hands, and fill a va&s;t number of Ba&s;ons that are all faced with &s;tone: however all this comes far &s;hort of the delightfulne&s;s of the lovely Ca&s;cades, and Water-works, with compartments of Beds Enamelled with Flowers, that are with us in <HI>Europe:</HI> they have indeed a kind of Beds and Borders, but nothing in them but Lillies planted at random on the &s;ides. Nor do they know neither what it is to have Hedg-rows, nor Wall-Fruit, for their Fruit-Trees &s;tand all open to the wind without order, as well as many Ro&s;e-Trees and Bidmisks: and what is wor&s;t of all, they &s;uffer all to go to ruin. For the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> are curious enough in beautifying their Hou&s;es, but in this they agree with the <HI>Turks,</HI> that they take no care to keep things in repair,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> repair no|thing.</NOTE> and it happens many times that they will let a whole building run to ruin for want of a handful of Pla&s;ter. In the&s;e Gardens they have &s;ome Lodgings, which con&s;i&s;t in cool Halls, and it is enough for them to come there now and then, and divert them&s;elves in the cool. In &s;hort, the&s;e Gardens might certainly be made pretty, for there is nothing wanting but order and contrivance.</P>
<P>As to what is about <HI>Schiras,</HI> I &s;aw no great matter the fir&s;t time that I &s;ojourned there. One day we went out of the Town on the <HI>North</HI> &s;ide, and having cro&s;&s;ed the River upon a Bridge of five Arches, we &s;aw on a Hill to the Right Hand, the ruins of a Ca&s;tle. Another day we went another way, but found nothing but &s;ome old demoli&s;hed Hou&s;es with Battlements, and a Well of a great depth,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A very deep Well.</NOTE> into which (as I was told,) heretofore they threw Adulterous women; it is &s;o deep that one may have time to &s;ay a <HI>Pater no&s;ter</HI> before a &s;tone that is ca&s;t into it can reach the bot|tom; it is dry and cut all out of the hard Rock, the Mouth of it is a &s;quare of two fathom in length, and one in breadth. A little beyond that we &s;aw a lovely Mo&s;que, where lies Interred that illu&s;trious <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Poet <HI>Scheikh Sadi,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><P>The Sepul|chre of <HI>Scheikh Sadi.</HI></P>
<P>A large Well with a pair of Stairs.</P></NOTE> whom they honour as a Saint. Near to that Mo&s;que there is a round Well, the Mouth whereof is two or three fathom in Diametre; they go down to it by a pair of Stairs, and in it you &s;ee a &s;quare &s;hallow Ba&s;on, through which runs a &s;tream of water &s;o full of Fi&s;h, that they appear in heaps over one another, and yet it is death to kill any of them; but the <HI>Dervi&s;h,</HI> who hath the care of it, makes no &s;cruple to &s;ell &s;ome to tho&s;e that have a mind: and that they may be &s;afely taken, he goes up, to hinder any from looking down into the Well, which he can ea&s;ily do, by telling tho&s;e who come, that there is a <HI>Kourouk,</HI> that is to &s;ay, women below, and that will make them to re|turn pre&s;ently. I have been there &s;ometimes with <HI>Dutch</HI> men, who took a great many with Hooks and Nets, whil&s;t the bigot <HI>Dervi&s;h</HI> &s;tood Sentinel at the Mouth above.</P>
<P>The people of <HI>Schiras</HI> are very witty,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Poets at <HI>Schi|ras.</HI></NOTE> and the City hath given birth to mo&s;t of the be&s;t Poets of <HI>Per&s;ia.</HI> There is much Gla&s;s made there, and &s;everal Gla&s;s-Shops are in the Town, though they work not con&s;tantly in their Gla&s;s-Hou&s;es,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gla&s;s-Hou&s;es at <HI>Schiras.</HI></NOTE> but let the Fire go out after they have employed a certain quantity of materials. They
<PB N="126" REF="233">
make their Gla&s;s of a White Stone, almo&s;t as hard as Marble, which they get in a Hill four days Journey from <HI>Schiras,</HI> and it is very clear: e&s;pecially they make great Bottles as clear and delicate as in any other place in the world; but it is wonder|fully &s;trange how they can blow the great Bottles,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Caraba.</NOTE> they call <HI>Caraba,</HI> which are as thick as ones Finger, and hold near thirty Quarts of Wine; the&s;e Bottles are co|vered with the Straw of Canes.</P>
<P>The Soil about <HI>Schiras</HI> is very good, and produces plenty of all things; they have of all the Fruits that we have, and Oranges and Limons in abundance: but they make a Wine, which, (without di&s;pute,) is one of the be&s;t Wines in the World, and the prime Wine of <HI>Per&s;ia.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Wine of <HI>Schiras.</HI></NOTE> In this Kingdom, it being a common &s;aying, <HI>Yes-de-Ka&s;t</HI> Bread, <HI>Schiras</HI> Wine, and <HI>Yezd</HI> Women; the hand&s;ome&s;t women of <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> being, (as they &s;ay,) in that Town. The Wine of <HI>Schiras</HI> is an excellent Stomach Wine, but very &s;trong, &s;o that without &s;poiling the ta&s;te of it, it will carry two thirds of water. It is not made of <HI>Ki&s;hmi&s;h,</HI> or Grapes without &s;tones, as at <HI>I&s;pahan</HI> becau&s;e then it would be &s;o &s;trong that it could not be drank, but it is made of com|mon Grapes: they have both Red and White, but the Red is the be&s;t: it is full of Lees, and therefore very heady; to remedy which they filtrate it through a Cloath, and then it is very clear and free from fumes. The people of <HI>Schiras</HI> make their Wine at <HI>Martlema&s;s,</HI> when the Grapes are already almo&s;t half dry; they &s;tay till they be &s;o before they gather their Vintage: when the Wine is made and in con|dition to be laid up, they burn Incen&s;e all over the Cellar, to take away all noy|&s;ome &s;cents, before they Cellar it up. They put it into great earthen Jarrs, which hold ten or twelve even to fourteen <HI>Carabas;</HI> but when they broach a Jarr, it mu&s;t be pre&s;ently drawn off, and Bottled up in <HI>Carabas;</HI> for if the Wine be left any time in the Jarr after it hath been opened, it &s;poils and grows Eagre. There is a great deal of that Wine made, and many Che&s;ts of it yearly &s;ent to <HI>I&s;pahan</HI> and the <HI>Indies;</HI> in each Ca&s;e or Che&s;t they put ten great Bottles, with a good deal of &s;traw; and two of the&s;e Che&s;ts make a Mules load.

<P>They pre&s;erve another thing in Vinegar, which I never &s;aw done any where el&s;e;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Pre&s;erved Grapes.</NOTE> and that is Grapes, which they gather half ripe, and the time of gathering them they take to be when the Sparrows begin to peck them; they put the&s;e Grapes into Bottles with good &s;tore of Vinegar, which &s;o macerates them, that they lo&s;e their hardne&s;s, yet no &s;o as to become too &s;oft, or lo&s;e their Greenne&s;s, only they look a little yellowi&s;h. The&s;e Grapes pre&s;erved in Vinegar, have a certain &s;weet acidity which is not unplea&s;ant, e&s;pecially in the great heats; and therefore they &s;end great quantities of them into the <HI>Indies.</HI></P>

<P>We parted from that place <HI>Tue&s;day</HI> the &s;eventeenth of <HI>March,</HI> half an hour after Six in the Morning, and marched <HI>South-Ea&s;t</HI> in a great green Plain, full of Heath, where we &s;aw on both hands &s;everal Villages, and a great many Flocks of Sheep feeding: having Travelled there till half an hour after two in the Afternoon, we arrived at a <HI>Kervan&s;eray,</HI> &s;tanding by it &s;elf, and called <HI>Mouzeferi,</HI> &s;even <HI>Agat&s;ch</HI> from <HI>Baba-Adgi,</HI> near to it there is a Spring of very good water,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mouzeferi.</NOTE> behind the <HI>Ker|van&s;eray,</HI> there are &s;everal vent-holes, by which one may &s;ee the water run, and Fi&s;h playing therein, whereof &s;ome are pretty big&punc; We parted from thence on <HI>Wedne&s;day</HI> the Eighteenth of <HI>March,</HI> half an hour after five in the Morning, and kept our way Southward, going up Hills, and down Hills covered with Turpentine-Trees and Heath; this Heath is like <HI>Tragacantha,</HI> and has a Carnation-Blo&s;&s;ome divided into four or five Leaves, bearing a kind of Wooll,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Turpentine-Trees.</HI> Tragacantha. Erigerum.

The Canal that pa&s;&s;es near to <HI>Paira,</HI> is cut from it a little above this place, and waters many Sowed fields, which being done, about four <HI>Agat&s;ch</HI> lower it falls again into the &s;ame River, from which it was never far di&s;tant; but in all its cour&s;e it runs through high ground, whereas the River rowls with a great noi&s;e in a very deep precipice.</P>
<P>We parted from that place <HI>Thur&s;day,</HI> the Nineteenth of <HI>March,</HI> at four of the Clock in the Morning, and held our way <HI>South-Ea&s;twards;</HI> having met now and then with very &s;tony ways, we found afterwards a fair way, where on each hand we &s;aw good Corn-Land, with a great many Villages, where there were many
<PB N="128" REF="234">
Gardens full of Trees. About eight a Clock in the Morning we arrived at a fair large <HI>Kervan&s;eray,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Chafer.</NOTE> called <HI>Kervan&s;eray Chafer,</HI> from the name of a Village clo&s;e by it, on the River-&s;ide, which at this place is dwindled away almo&s;t to nothing; this is a great Village, and nothing to be &s;een in it but Gardens, with long Walks in them, where one may take the Air under the &s;hade of Orange-Trees, which are prodigi|ou&s;ly big, and bear much Fruit. There they have plenty al&s;o of Limon, Pome|granate, Date, and other Fruit-Trees of all &s;orts, nay and Vines al&s;o; and the River runs in a bottom by the back of the Village: in &s;hort, it is a very agreeable place, e&s;pecially to tho&s;e who have Travelled over large, barren, and dry Coun|tries; this Village is three <HI>Agat&s;ch</HI> from <HI>Paira.</HI></P>
<P>We left that plea&s;ant Quarter <HI>Friday,</HI> the Twentieth of <HI>March,</HI> half an hour after one a Clock in the morning, keeping &s;till <HI>South-Ea&s;twards</HI> in our way, but a little toward the <HI>South,</HI> in a fair even and &s;mooth Road: about four of the Clock we cro&s;&s;ed a large Brook of running water, which comes from the River of <HI>Paira</HI> below <HI>Chafer;</HI> and a little after we cro&s;&s;ed a Canal of running water, over a little Bridge. We afterwards cro&s;&s;ed &s;everal other little Brooks, having always to our Right Hand a great many Villages, about break of day it behoved us to pa&s;s one large Brook more; and about &s;ix a Clock in the Morning we found a little Hou&s;e where <HI>Rahdars</HI> lived: about two or three Musket-&s;hot from thence, at the foot of a Hill,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tadivan.</NOTE> there is a Village call <HI>Tadivan,</HI> where the River of <HI>Paira</HI> lo&s;es it &s;elf and ends.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Families of <HI>Arabs.</HI></NOTE>Upon that Road we met &s;everal <HI>Arabs</HI> with their Wives and Children on Ca|mels, which carried all their baggage al&s;o; they were driving their Flocks of Sheep and Goats. Since our departure from <HI>Schiras</HI> we dayly met &s;uch, and they came from about <HI>Gomron</HI> and <HI>Lar.</HI> The&s;e <HI>Arabs</HI> Lodge under black Tents, and have va&s;t Flocks, wherein con&s;i&s;ts the greate&s;t part of their &s;ub&s;tance: and that is partly the rea&s;on that they have no fixed Habitation, and that they even remove from one Country into another in the different &s;ea&s;ons of the Year, ju&s;t as &s;ome Birds doe: For in the Spring they leave the Country of <HI>Lar,</HI> and other places thereabout, where the Heat is too great; and packing up bag and baggage betake them&s;elves with their whole Families towards <HI>Couchouzer,</HI> which is a Village, I have menti|oned, with very good Land about it: and when Winter begins to draw nigh, they pack up their Hou&s;es again, and with their Flocks return towards <HI>Lar</HI> and <HI>Gomron,</HI> where it is never Cold. It is not only the Heat that in the Summer-time drives them out of the hot Countrys, but al&s;o the &s;carcity of water, for they need a great deal for their Flocks. They are almo&s;t all Black, both men and women, have long black Hair, and cover not their Faces.</P>
<P>About Nine a Clock in the Morning we entered into &s;tony way, where we kept marching till half an hour after Ten, that we arrived at a little <HI>Kervan&s;eray,</HI> called <HI>Mouchek,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Mouchek.</NOTE> &s;tanding by it &s;elf, and built in &s;tony ground &s;urrounded with Hills: about &s;ome hundred paces behind this <HI>Kervan&s;eray</HI> there is a great round Ci&s;tern, four or five Fathom in Diametre, and is very deep; it is covered with a great Dome of rough &s;tone, that hath &s;ix Entries, by &s;o many Doors that are round it, by which they go in to draw water, which in the Spring-time is &s;o high, that it comes almo&s;t up to the Doors, &s;welling &s;o high by the Rain-water in the Winter-time, by means of a Trench that comes from a neighbouring Hill: at each Door there are &s;teps to go down to the bottom, when the water is low, for there is no other water in that place. They make,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ci&s;terns.</NOTE> be&s;ides, in tho&s;e Quarters Ci&s;terns after another manner; they are of an Oblong Square, covered with a long Convex Vault, &s;haped much like the Roof of a Coach, with a Door at each end: and one of the&s;e ways are all the Ci&s;terns from that place to <HI>Bender,</HI> built.</P>
<P>We parted from that <HI>Kervan&s;eray,</HI> which is &s;ix <HI>Agat&s;ch</HI> di&s;tant from <HI>Chafer, Sa|turday</HI> the one and twentieth of <HI>May,</HI> half an hour after Two a Clock in the Morning, and had &s;tony way till about Four, after that we found a good Road which led us full <HI>South:</HI> about half an hour after Five we pa&s;t by the Walls of a ruinated <HI>Kervan&s;eray,</HI> with a Ci&s;tern adjoyning it: about Seven a Clock we found &s;ome Brooks, and then Travelled among&s;t good Corn-Fields, until half an hour after Ten, when having pa&s;&s;ed by a great many Gardens, we arrived at a large <HI>Kervan&s;eray,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Dgiaroun.</NOTE> which is about an hundred paces from a little Town called <HI>Dgiaroun,</HI> and is hardly worth a good Village; however there is a fair <HI>Bazar</HI> in it.

They have many Wells there, and draw their water with Oxen, as in all the re&s;t of <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> in the manner I have de&s;cribed when I treated of <HI>Mo&s;ul.</HI> There is a Ci&s;tern near the <HI>Kervan&s;eray</HI> like to that of <HI>Mouchek,</HI> but it is bigger, having at lea&s;t &s;even or eight Fathom in it Diametre: it has a little hou&s;e belonging to it, which con&s;i&s;ts of a Kitchin and a Lodging-Room, for the u&s;e of &s;uch as will not Lodge in the <HI>Kervan&s;eray,</HI> or cannot when it is full: this place is five <HI>Agat&s;ch</HI> di&s;tant from <HI>Mouchek,</HI> there we began to feel the heat, though in the Mornings a little before Sun ri&s;ing, we had pretty cold Winds: before the Gate of the <HI>Kervan&s;eray</HI> there is one of tho&s;e Ox Wells, with a great trough for watering the Hor&s;es, but it is not good for men who in the Town drink running-water.</P>
<P>We &s;tayed there all that day and the following, and departed <HI>Monday,</HI> the three and twentieth of <HI>March,</HI> half an hour after midnight: we took our way We&s;tward by a very &s;tony Road; about an hour after, we found a Ci&s;tern covered with a &s;teep Roof: half an hour after two we began to a&s;cend the Hill of <HI>Dgiaroun,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Hill of <HI>Dgiaroun.</HI></NOTE> to the <HI>South,</HI> it is very high, and the a&s;cent not difficult, &s;ave only that the way is full of &s;tones; but the higher one goes the wor&s;e it is, and be&s;ides, there is danger from Precipices that are on one &s;ide of it; the truth is, they have built little brea&s;t-walls, about two foot high in &s;ome places, to keep the Mules from falling down: there one may &s;ee wild bitter Almond-Trees, and other Trees of the Mountains. We went up three or four times, and down as often, and the Sun found us in this exerci&s;e: about five a Clock we came to a Ci&s;tern covered with a <HI>Dome,</HI> and an hour after to another with a &s;teep Roof. Half an hour after &s;even we were pa&s;&s;ed our up Hills and down Hills; but the way was &s;till &s;tony and bad: at length, about nine of the Clock, we came to a little <HI>Kervan&s;eray</HI> &s;tanding all alone, near to which are two Ci&s;terns, the one covered with a <HI>Dome,</HI> three or four Fathom in Diametre, wherein there are three Doors, and as many Windows; the other has a &s;teep Roof: this place is called <HI>T&s;chai-telhh,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">T&s;chai-telhh.</NOTE> (that is to &s;ay) bitter Well, becau&s;e of a Well not far from that <HI>Kervan&s;eray</HI> who&s;e water is bitter.

<P>Next Morning, <HI>Tue&s;day,</HI> about half an hour after four, we &s;et forward again, directing our march <HI>Southwards:</HI> about &s;even a Clock we de&s;cended into a very low place, by very bad way; that Hill is called <HI>Chotali Ha&s;ani,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Chotali Ha&s;a|ni, <HI>or</HI> Chotali Mahhma&s;eni.</NOTE> or <HI>Chotali Mahhma|&s;eni,</HI> it goes by both names: towards the bottom of that de&s;cent we found a little Brook that runs out of the Ground, and di&s;charges it &s;elf into a &s;quare Ba&s;on at &s;ome few paces from the &s;ource; being come down we Travelled through a very &s;tony Plain: about half an hour after Nine we came to a fair <HI>Kerva-&s;eray,</HI> &s;tanding alone by it &s;elf, and called <HI>Momzir,</HI> having a great &s;quare Ba&s;on before the Gate,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Momzir.</NOTE> which is always filled full by a Brook that runs into it; this <HI>Kervan&s;eray</HI> is four <HI>Agat&s;ch</HI> from <HI>T&s;chai-telhh,</HI> we made no &s;top there, becau&s;e we found no body to &s;ell us Provi&s;ions either for Men or Bea&s;ts: &s;o we continued our march in the &s;tony Plain, till about an hour after, having found a little Brook on our Left Hand, we entered about Noon into a great &s;mooth Plain, where we &s;uffered much heat: we Travelled on <HI>South-Ea&s;tward,</HI> until about two of the Clock that we found a little <HI>Kervan&s;eray,</HI> clo&s;e by a Village called <HI>Dehidombe,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Dehidombe.</NOTE> (that is to &s;ay) the Village of the tail, where there are &s;ome Palms and Tamarisk-Trees.

<P>We parted from thence on <HI>Wedne&s;day,</HI> the five and twentieth of <HI>March,</HI> about half an hour after four in the Morning, and marched over a very even Plain, till half an hour after &s;even, when we arrived at a <HI>Kervan&s;eray,</HI> at the end of a large Village called <HI>Benaru,</HI> lying at the foot of the Hill, that is to the right of it,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Benaru.</NOTE> upon which, on the other &s;ide of the <HI>Kervan&s;eray,</HI> are the ruins of many folid Buildings, that reach from the top to the bottom of the Hill, and &s;eem to have been &s;ome

There is nothing to be &s;een at <HI>Lar,</HI> but the <HI>Chans</HI> Hou&s;e, the Market-Place, the <HI>Bazars</HI> and the Ca&s;tle.

<P>It Rained all <HI>Wedne&s;day,</HI> and next night, which hindered us from &s;etting out; but <HI>Thur&s;day</HI> the &s;econd of <HI>April,</HI> about five of the Clock in the Morning, we con|tinued our Journy, going &s;treight <HI>Ea&s;t,</HI> in a very good Sandy way betwixt Corn-Fields; for the Villages are very thick thereabouts. On that Road I ob&s;erved a pretty plea&s;ant thing, which is practi&s;ed in all that Country as far as <HI>Bendar Aba&s;&s;i:</HI> I &s;aw &s;everal Pea&s;ants running about the Corn-Fields, who rai&s;ed loud &s;houts, and every now and then clacked whips with all their force; and all this, to drive away the Birds which devour all their Corn: when they &s;ee Flocks of them coming from a neighbouring Ground, that they may not light on theirs, they redouble their cries, to make them go farther; and this they do every day Morning and Evening. The truth is, there are &s;o great numbers of Sparrows in <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> that they de&s;troy all things, and &s;care-Crows are &s;o far from frightning them, that they will Pearch upon them. At eight a Clock we pa&s;&s;ed by a little covered <HI>Kervan|&s;eray</HI> called <HI>T&s;cherchab,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">T&s;cherchab.</NOTE> which puts an end to the Corn-Fields; for beyond that, there is hardly any thing to be found but De&s;arts &s;owed with &s;tones: about two hours after we pa&s;&s;ed by another <HI>Kervan&s;eray,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Tenghinoun.</NOTE> like to the former, called <HI>Tenghinoun;</HI> and a little further to the Left Hand, we &s;aw a &s;mall Forre&s;t of Palm-Trees. We after|wards marched on for the &s;pace of about two hours through very &s;tony Ground, and then came to good even Sandy way.

<P>The&s;e <HI>Kervan&s;erays</HI> are not built as others are, but are little covered buildings, about &s;ix Fathom long, and as many broad on the out&s;ide, and about a Fathom and a half high: in the middle of each Front there is a Gate, and you enter by the&s;e Gates under &s;o many Vaulted Walks, which run cro&s;s-ways within, and have each about two Fathom in length; they leave in the middle or Centre of the cro&s;s they make, a little Square about two Fathom every way, covered with a <HI>Dome.</HI> In &s;ome of them, there is in each Vault a half pace of &s;tone two foot high, and about a Fathom broad; in the out&s;ide is the Hou&s;e of the Hou&s;e-keeper, or <HI>Con|dar,</HI> (as they call him:) it &s;tands along one of the &s;ides of the <HI>Kervan&s;eray,</HI> and in|&s;tead of Walls, is only enclo&s;ed with a little Hedge; in the mean time all the Provi&s;ions you are to expect, mu&s;t be had out of the&s;e wretched Hovels. When there is no body in the <HI>Kervan&s;eray,</HI> the&s;e Hou&s;e-keepers retire to their Village or Huts, which is out of the way a quarter or half a <HI>French</HI> League from thence, and &s;ometimes Travellers mu&s;t go look for them, when they have had no no|tice of their coming. In the Angles of the&s;e <HI>Kervan&s;erays</HI> there are commonly lit|tle Chambers, which have the Doors on the out&s;ide, and the re&s;t of the place is for the Hor&s;es; there is no other water but what is drawn out of Ci|&s;terns, of which there are many in the Fields a little way from the <HI>Ker|van&s;eray.</HI></P>
<P>We parted from that wretched Lodging <HI>Friday</HI> the third of <HI>April,</HI> about four a Clock in the Evening, and Travelled through a large very even Plain, where we &s;aw in many places the Ground whitened over with Salt, which is made by the Rain:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Bahadini.

<P>We parted from thence on <HI>Saturday</HI> half an hour after a eleven a Clock at Night, and took our way full <HI>South,</HI> by a very bad and &s;tony Road. <HI>Sunday</HI> about four a Clock in the Morning we pa&s;&s;ed by a little covered <HI>Kervan&s;eray,</HI> called <HI>Serten,</HI> then taking our way <HI>Ea&s;tward,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Serten.

Our way continued &s;till bad, till about &s;even of the Clock in the Morning, that we came to a <HI>Kervan&s;eray,</HI> called <HI>Tengbidalan;</HI> this <HI>Kervan&s;eray</HI> is covered as many others are,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tengbidalan.</NOTE> but it is much finer. It is a Square about eight Fathom; in the middle of each Face there is a great Arch, by which one enters into Vaults, which make a Cro&s;s, as in the others, but they are higher, and it is not under the&s;e Vaults that Travellers Lodge; for the Chambers are in the four Corners, about three Fathom &s;quare, two or three foot rai&s;ed from the Ground, and open on the two &s;ides within, where there are great Arches from the Floor up to the Vault; each Chamber hath its Chimny, and other &s;mall conveniences: the Place in the middle is covered with a <HI>Dome,</HI> in which there is a great round opening in the top, By one of the Gates of this <HI>Kervan&s;eray</HI> there runs a very clear Brook, about a good Foot broad, which falls into an oblong &s;quare Ba&s;on in the middle, and keeps it always full; then it pa&s;&s;es farther in &s;uch another Canal as brought it, and runs out at the oppo&s;ite Gate: this Brook comes from a Hill two Muskets &s;hot from the <HI>Kervan|&s;eray;</HI> it falls down from it impetuou&s;ly in a Channel above a Foot broad, and about half as deep, and is received on the fir&s;t Pillar of a broken Arch, which is &s;haped like a Well; there are a great many of the&s;e broken Arches in a row, with &s;ome ruins of the Pillars; and I believe they have been beaten down by the force of the water, which in time of Rain is very great at that place, nay &s;ome of it too ran then betwixt the Pillars: perhaps it was becau&s;e they were afraid of that accident, that they brought not the water upon the&s;e Arches, which in all appear|ance were only made for Ornament. The water falling down into this Well, runs under Ground about twenty Fathom length, and comes up again by the Pillar of the fir&s;t of the Arches that remain entire to the number of eleven, (this Pillar being al&s;o like a well) and ri&s;ing to a height, it glides away in a Channel like to that which comes from the Hill, &s;ave that it is carried along the&s;e Arches that are about a Fathom and a half high, till coming to a higher Ground, the Canal is not above two Foot high, and a little farther runs level with the Ground, where making &s;everal turnings and windings, it waters the Roots of a great deal of Liquorice growing by the &s;ides of it, until it come to the <HI>Kervan&s;eray.</HI> The truth is, that water is not good to drink, and it is only nece&s;&s;ity that makes men u&s;e it, when there is none in a Ci&s;tern clo&s;e by; but it &s;erves at lea&s;t to cool the <HI>Kervan|&s;eray,</HI> and to wa&s;h any thing in. Adjoyning to this <HI>Kervan&s;eray</HI> there is another very little one, through which the &s;ame water runs; and a little farther there is a third, which is bigger, but &s;omewhat ruinous. This place is five <HI>Agat&s;ch</HI> from <HI>Hhormont.</HI></P>
<P>We parted from thence <HI>Monday</HI> the &s;ixth of <HI>April,</HI> half an hour after Midnight; at fir&s;t, for above an hour we had very bad &s;tony way, but it proved pretty good afterward; about two in the Morning we pa&s;&s;ed by a little covered <HI>Kervan|&s;eray,</HI> called <HI>Berkei Dobend,</HI> and about four a Clock by another, called <HI>Dgei Hhon:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Berkei Dobend.

<P><PB N="134" REF="237">We parted from thence about half an hour after one a Clock in the Morning: during a large quarter of an hour we had bad &s;tony way; and about half an hour after five we pa&s;&s;ed by a little covered <HI>Kervan&s;eray,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Berkei Soltou|ni.</NOTE> called <HI>Berkei Soltouni;</HI> about three quarters of an hour after &s;even we came to &s;uch another, near to a great Vil|lage called <HI>Coure&s;ton,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Coure&s;ton.</NOTE> four <HI>Agat&s;ch</HI> from <HI>Kor Bazirghion:</HI> we left the Caravan at this place, becau&s;e our Carriers took Camels to fini&s;h the Journy with, and re|&s;olved to Travel only by day, and to be four days longer by the way: I there|fore took a Camel to carry my man and baggage, and a guide to &s;hew us the way, which from thence to <HI>Bender</HI> is &s;o difficult, that he who hath Travelled it fifty times may lo&s;e him&s;elf there in; &s;o that it is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to take a man of the Country, if one would not wander out of the way.</P>
<P>We parted about eleven a Clock at Night, and pre&s;ently entered into a great &s;andy Plain, which neverthele&s;s is peopled, and hath a great many Villages, that are to be &s;een here and there: this is occa&s;ioned by the abundance of Palm-Trees that this Country is full of, the Soil being proper for them, though very barren for any thing el&s;e.

<P>Betwixt three and four of the Clock we went over a very high and fair Bridge, above three Fathom broad, and betwixt &s;even and eight hundred common Paces long, it is well Paved, and has a &s;ide-Wall on each &s;ide about a Foot and a half high: under this Bridge runs a River above nine or ten Fathom broad; which is heard at a great di&s;tance, by rea&s;on of the noi&s;e it makes in its cour&s;e; there is no drinking of the water of it, for it is Salt, and it di&s;charges it &s;elf into the Sea about &s;ix hundred Paces from thence.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rohhouna.</NOTE> The name of that River is <HI>Rohhouna,</HI> that is to &s;ay the running River, and that is the name they give to all great Rivers; it comes from <HI>Kermont;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Pouli Seugh.</NOTE> the name of the Bridge is <HI>Pouli Seugh,</HI> that is to &s;ay Stone-Bridge, or otherwi&s;e <HI>Pouli Core&s;ton;</HI> before this River comes to the Bridge, it runs by the Foot of the Hills on the Left Hand <HI>Northwards,</HI> and there it begins to be Salt: when it comes to this Bridge, which indeed, is only upon the &s;ide of it, find|ing it &s;o runs along the &s;ide of it, and di&s;charges but part of its water underneath in pa&s;&s;ing, which running under the Arches, and finding the Ground lower on the other &s;ide of the Bridge, falls with great impetuo&s;ity, and that makes the rumbling noi&s;e that is heard at &s;uch a di&s;tance; the re&s;t of the water running along by the Bridge, turns afterwards towards the <HI>South,</HI> and lo&s;es it &s;elf in the Sea.

<P><HI>Wedne&s;day</HI> the eighth of <HI>April,</HI> about &s;ix of the Clock in the Morning, we came to a covered <HI>Kervan&s;eray</HI> called <HI>Ghet&s;chi,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ghet&s;chi.</NOTE> &s;ix <HI>Agat&s;ch</HI> from <HI>Coure&s;ton.</HI> There is ano|ther be&s;ides, clo&s;e by, which is not covered; but like the re&s;t in all things el&s;e, and a little ruinous.</P>
<P>There were &s;everal Tents of black Goats hair thereabout, and as &s;oon as we arrived, a great many Women and Girls came out of them to vi&s;it us: they were cloathed with blew &s;treak<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">d Drawers, and a blew Shirt over them; their No&s;es, Ears, Arms and Feet, were full of Silver, Copper, Bone, or Gla&s;s-Rings: every one of them held an Earthen Porringer full of <HI>Yogourt</HI> or Sower Milk, and a little Ve&s;&s;el full of the &s;ame under their Arms; and to invite us to buy &s;ome of them, in our pre&s;ence dabbed four Fingers and a Thumb into their Budgets, and pulled out Butter full of Straws, which they mingled with the Milk that was in their Porrin|gers, and then poured out more Sower Milk out of the &s;ame Borrachy: their Hu&s;|bands are all Fi&s;hermen, and both men and women are Inhabitants fit for &s;uch a Country.</P>
<P>We parted from that place the &s;ame day half an hour after &s;ix in the Evening, and continued our Journy along the &s;andy Plain: about eight a Clock we pa&s;&s;ed a narrow &s;treight betwixt little Hills, and having kept turning about half a quar|ter of an hour, we found two ways, the one to the Left Hand over a pretty high Hill, and the other to the Right, which hardly appeared; we followed this la&s;t,

leaving that to the Left Hand which is very dangerous, if we may believe the peo|ple of the Country; for they would needs per&s;uade us that on that Hill there were <HI>Dgius</HI> who killed all Pa&s;&s;engers: by that word <HI>Dgius</HI> they under&s;tand evil Spirits,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dgius.</NOTE> which (they &s;ay) are of a middle Nature betwixt Angels and Men.

Neverthele&s;s the way &s;eems to be &s;o much the better, that though we had warning given us, we began to mount by it, when our Guide &s;uddenly called to us, and made us follow him the other; this Hill is called <HI>Koucht&s;cheizer Gheroun.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Koucht&s;cheizer Gheroun.</NOTE></P>

<P>I Shall take the occa&s;ion of this &s;econd abode at <HI>Schiras</HI> to give the de&s;cription of what is mo&s;t lovely and curious to be &s;een in that Country, though indeed, there be no more but ruins, whereof the Antiquity is not well known, nor what they have been in former times; but they de&s;erve to be &s;een by Travellers who go into tho&s;e parts, and are very well worth the pains of Reading, by tho&s;e who had rather tru&s;t to my relation, than to go and &s;ee them them&s;elves. For my part I had plea&s;ure enough in &s;eeing them, and Mon&s;ieur <HI>Doliere</HI> was with me; he came from <HI>France</HI> with Mon&s;ieur <HI>Tavernier</HI> as far as <HI>Bender,</HI> from whence we came back toge|ther to <HI>Schiras;</HI> he with de&s;ign to return to <HI>France,</HI> and I to &s;hift el&s;ewhere, and go on to the <HI>Indies:</HI> I could have wi&s;hed not to have left him &s;o &s;oon, for he is an hone&s;t man, and very plea&s;ant Company.</P>

The oppo&s;ite Figure &s;eems to be of a woman, holding in one Hand a kind of Holy-water-pot, and we could not devi&s;e what it was &s;he held in the other, it being &s;o broken and cut with a Chizzel, unle&s;s it be a Candle&s;tick and Candle, or rather a Holy-water-&s;prinkle.

<P>This &s;quare is about &s;even Fathom long; towards the middle there is a little Stone-Fat of an Oblong &s;quare, with a hole in the bottom to let out the water.

In one Hand they hold either a Torch or a Pike, I cannot tell which, for they are &s;o &s;poilt that hardly any thing is to be di&s;cerned. On the other &s;ide of the &s;ame Door a little towards the <HI>South,</HI> there is another &s;tone with the like Figures. The people of the Country call that place <HI>Me&s;dgidi Mader Soliman,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Me&s;dgidi Ma|der Soliman.</NOTE> (that is to &s;ay) the Mo&s;que of the Mother of <HI>Soliman,</HI> but can give no rea&s;on for it. The <HI>Mahometans</HI> in and about <HI>Schiras</HI> go and pray in that Temple, the day of the little <HI>Bairam</HI> or <HI>Courban Bairami,</HI> (that is to &s;ay) the day of their <HI>Ea&s;ter</HI> of Sacrifices. In fine, the&s;e Antiquities are little preludes to tho&s;e of <HI>T&s;chehel-minar,</HI> I had a man who &s;aid plai&s;antly, that the place where they are, ought to be called the little Brother of <HI>T&s;che|hel-minar.</HI></P>
<P>Having con&s;idered it, you are to go down the other &s;ide of the Hill, oppo&s;ite to that by which they come up, and continue your way <HI>South-Ea&s;t,</HI> a few &s;teps off, you &s;ee to the Right Hand a Spring that runs at the Foot of the Hill, and makes a little Bog &s;haded over by many high and great Trees, which render this place very plea&s;ant: a little further, you &s;ee to the Right Hand a Thicket or &s;mall Wood, all of Ro&s;e-Trees, which yield a very lovely pro&s;pect when they are in the Flower, as I &s;aw them. You mu&s;t then leave the High-way which leads to the Salt-Lake, and draw near the Hills that are to the Left Hand, and but very little di&s;tant from the Road; and having kept going a good quarter of an hour more, you come to a very delightful place; for there you have a great many clear Springs full of Fi&s;h, that glide under the &s;hade of a great many Planes, A&s;h-Trees and Willows, which &s;o extend their Boughs, that at Noon day they cover you from the Sun, and there you may delightfully &s;pend the whole day in the cool.</P>
<P>When you are come into this charming place, you mu&s;t alight from your Hor&s;e, and pa&s;s over a little water clo&s;e by the Hill upon &s;tepping &s;tones, that are there in great quantity; and in a place where the Hill bending makes a kind of Semicircle; you &s;ee at two Fathoms height,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><P>The Antiqui|ty of <HI>Kadem|ghah.</HI></P>
<P>Two Figures in a Rock.</P>
<P>The Figure of a Woman.</P></NOTE> two Figures of the ordinary bigne&s;s in Relief, cut in the natural Rock; the&s;e Figures are &s;omewhat hid by a Fig-Tree, which hath taken Root at the Foot of the Rock, but it is ea&s;ie to get up betwixt the Rock and the Fig-Tree, and to con&s;ider them at nearer di&s;tance. The fir&s;t of the&s;e &s;eems to be the Figure of a Woman with a naked Body, unle&s;s towards the Legs, where one may perceive &s;ome folds of a Gown; behind her Head there is a kind of Crown of Rayes cut in the Rock; &s;he &s;tretches out both her Hands to the neighbouring Figure. as to receive &s;omething that it pre&s;ents to her: that neighbouring Figure repre&s;ents a Man with a long Beard,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Figure of a Man.</NOTE> and his Hair made up into Tre&s;&s;es behind; his Head-attire &s;eems to be much like a <HI>Swi&s;&s;es</HI> Cap, for it &s;ets clo&s;e to his Head, covers all his Brow, and is broader above than below; there is this difference that it ri&s;es round in&s;tead of being flat on the Crown: he hath a Girdle and a Sword hanging at his Left &s;ide, which is above two Foot and a half long, and at the Guard four Fingers broad at lea&s;t, but growing broader and broader it is five Fin|gers broad at the end, and draws not into a point: this man &s;eems to pre&s;ent to the Woman a Po&s;ie of Flowers with the Right Hand, and re&s;ts his Left Hand upon the Handle of his Sword.</P>
<P>A little farther, about ten Fathom from thence, and at the &s;ame height of Ground,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Two other Figures.</NOTE> there are two other Figures of the &s;ame bigne&s;s, of which the fir&s;t is of a young Man without a Beard, who&s;e curled Locks hang backwards behind his Head; on it he carries a great Globe, it might be taken for a Turban, but, in my Opinion, it appears not to be his Head-attire, though he hath no other; he looks towards the neighbouring Figure, and hath the Left Hand &s;hut, wherein he &s;eems
<PB N="141" REF="240">
to hold &s;omewhat; the Right Hand is &s;tretched out, as if ready to receive what is pre&s;ented to him. The Figure that is by him &s;eems to be of a Woman, for &s;he hath pretty round Brea&s;ts; neverthele&s;s &s;he wears a Sword by her &s;ide, like to that which I have ju&s;t now de&s;cribed; her Head-attire &s;eems to be the Cap of a <HI>Dervi&s;ch,</HI> &s;omewhat long and all round; upon her Left Shoulder &s;he hath a little Basket, or perhaps it is only the Tre&s;&s;es of her Hair: &s;he &s;eems to pre&s;ent &s;omething with her Right Hand, to the man who is looking towards her, and her Left Hand is upon the Handle of her Sword. All the&s;e Figures &s;eem to have the Body naked, and only &s;ome few foldings of a Garment towards the Legs. In &s;hort the two la&s;t are almo&s;t in the &s;ame po&s;ture and action as the two fir&s;t; but one cannot tell what it is they pre&s;ent to one another, for the extremities of their Hands, as well as many other parts of their Bodies, are worn out and eaten by the weather. The Work appears very well, hath been good, though all the proportions be not ex|actly ob&s;erved. I looked about all along the &s;ide of the Hill, but could &s;ee no more; and I believe there has been &s;ome Temple there.</P>
<P>This place is &s;o covered with Trees, and encompa&s;&s;ed by Mari&s;hes, by rea&s;on of the many Springs thereabouts, that few people know of it; and of all the <HI>Franks</HI> the Reverend Father <HI>Athana&s;ius,</HI> a bare-Footed <HI>Carmelite,</HI> living at <HI>Schiras,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Father <HI>Atha|na&s;ius.</HI></NOTE> was the fir&s;t that found it out by chance, as he was walking in that place; and it being my fortune to pa&s;s by <HI>Schiras</HI> &s;ometime after, he led me to it. The people of the Country call that place <HI>Kadem-Ghah,</HI> (that is to &s;ay,) the place of the &s;tep;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Kadem-Ghah:</NOTE> becau&s;e, (&s;ay they,) I know not what old Man walking in that place, a Spring of water gu&s;hed out under his Foot: it is but a few &s;teps wide of the High-way, that leads to the Salt-Lake, an <HI>Agat&s;ch</HI> di&s;tant from thence.</P>
<P>Though all the&s;e Antiquities be curious enough, yet they are not that which they call the Antiquities of <HI>T&s;chehel-minar,</HI> &s;o much mentioned in Relations, and which are in effect, the &s;ame at pre&s;ent in <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> as the Pyramids are in <HI>Egypt,</HI> (that is to &s;ay,) the fine&s;t thing in its kind that is to be &s;een, and the mo&s;t wor|thy of ob&s;ervation. One may go thither in coming from <HI>I&s;pahan</HI> by <HI>Main,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The way to <HI>T&s;chehel-Mi|nar.</HI></NOTE> or <HI>Abgherim,</HI> and the way is not long; but the way to it from <HI>Schiras</HI> is by <HI>Badgega,</HI> which is the fir&s;t <HI>Kervan&s;eray</HI> upon the Road to <HI>I&s;pahan;</HI> and after two hours march from thence, there are two ways, whereof that to the Left goes to <HI>I&s;pahan,</HI> you mu&s;t leave it, and take the way to the Right Hand which leads to <HI>T&s;chehel-minar</HI> Having Travelled about two hours and a half that way in a pretty good Road among&s;t Heath, there is a Village on the Right Hand where one may &s;top and bait. Having pa&s;&s;ed this Village, you enter into a great Plain, where after you have Travelled three quarters of an hour, you pa&s;s over a Cau&s;ey a Fathom and a half broad, and about an hundred paces in length; a little after you find another three hundred paces long; and a little beyond that ju&s;t &s;uch another: having Travelled a little farther, you go over another Cau&s;ey five hundred paces in length, beyond which, after three quarters of an hours Journy, you come to a great Bridge of two large Arches which is called <HI>Pouli-Chan:</HI> in the middlemo&s;t Pillar of it there is a Room with &s;ome &s;teps to go down to it, which would be very delightful to take the fre&s;h Air in, if it were not uninhabitable by rea&s;on of the prodigious &s;warms of Gnats that haunt it. The River of <HI>Bendemir</HI> runs under this Bridge, and is at that place broad, deep, and full of Fi&s;h, the water looking very white: they a&s;&s;ured me that it &s;wells &s;o high in the Winter-time that it reaches over the Arches, almo&s;t level with the Parapet: after you have pa&s;&s;ed that Bridge, and Travelled an hour longer in a Plain, you leave a Village upon your Left Hand, and an hour after another to the Right, and then within another hour you come to the Village called <HI>Mirchas-Chan,</HI> near to which is <HI>T&s;chehel-minar;</HI> being but a quarter of an hours Journy from it. This Village &s;tands in a mo&s;t &s;pacious and Fruitful Plain, watered with a great many waters; there you have a <HI>Kervan&s;eray</HI> to Lodge in, becau&s;e in the Winter-time, it is the way from <HI>I&s;pahan</HI> to <HI>Schiras,</HI> and going <HI>Ea&s;tward,</HI> but &s;omewhat to the <HI>South</HI> from this Village, you arrive at <HI>T&s;chehel-minar.</HI></P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. VII.</HI> Of <HI>T&s;chehel-minar</HI> and <HI>Nak&s;chi Ru&s;tan.</HI></HEAD>
<P>I Am of their Opinion who will have <HI>T&s;chehel-Minar</HI> to be part of the Ancient <HI>Per&s;epolis,</HI> which was built in the place where at pre&s;ent &s;tands the large Bur|rough of <HI>Mirkas Chan;</HI> not only becau&s;e of the River which <HI>Diodorus Siculus,</HI> and others mention to be there under the name of the little <HI>Araxes,</HI> which is now called <HI>Bendemir,</HI> but al&s;o of many other marks that cannot be called into que&s;tion.</P>
<P>All <HI>T&s;chehel-Minar</HI> is built upon the skirt of a Hill. The fir&s;t thing that pre|&s;ents to view upon ones arrival, is a great Wall of blacki&s;h &s;tones four Foot thick, which &s;upports a large Platform or Terra&s;s, reaching from <HI>South</HI> to <HI>North,</HI> about five hundred Paces in length to the <HI>We&s;t</HI> &s;ide, it hath the Plain to the <HI>Ea&s;t;</HI> beyond a great many magnificent ruins of Buildings (whereof it makes the begin|ning,) it hath the Hill, which bending into a Semicircle, forms a kind of Amphi|theatre that embraces all tho&s;e &s;tately ruins: to a&s;cend to the top of this Terra&s;s, you mu&s;t go to the farther end of it towards the <HI>North,</HI> where at fir&s;t you will find two Stair-Ca&s;es,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The fir&s;t Stairs of <HI>T&s;che|hel-Minar.</HI></NOTE> or rather one Stair-Ca&s;e of two a&s;cents, or if you plea&s;e a double Stair-Ca&s;e, which on each &s;ide hath fix and fifty &s;teps of a greyi&s;h &s;tone, and are &s;o ea&s;ie that Hor&s;es go up them without any difficulty: having a&s;cended by one of the &s;ides of that double Stair-Ca&s;e up to a &s;quare Landing-place, where one may re&s;t, and which is proportioned to the breadth of the Stairs, you continue to go up by the upper part of the Stair-Ca&s;e, which goes contrary to the lower part; my meaning is, that the upper part of the Stair-Ca&s;e above the Landing place, goes <HI>North,</HI> whereas the lower went <HI>Southward;</HI> and the upper part of the other &s;ide which went <HI>North</HI> below, goes <HI>Southward</HI> above; &s;o that the&s;e two Stair-Ca&s;es which bore off from one another in their fir&s;t part, draw near again in the &s;econd, and Land in on the &s;ame place above; and that upper part of the Stair-Ca&s;e has forty &s;ix &s;teps.</P>
<P>Being come to the top of the Stair-Ca&s;e, you find a Walk, and traceing it <HI>Ea&s;twards</HI> you &s;ee two great Pila&s;ters in Front, which bear nothing at pre&s;ent, but &s;eem to make the two &s;ides of an Entry, they appear to be but of one &s;ingle &s;tone apiece though they be very high: On the in&s;ide of each of the&s;e Pila&s;ters, you &s;ee the Figure of a Bea&s;t cut in Demi-relief; but it is hard to tell whether it be a Hor&s;e or an Elephant, and I &s;hould rather take it to be the latter, at lea&s;t it &s;eems to me to re&s;emble that more: however it be, the&s;e Figures are about three Fathom high, and are (as I &s;aid,) in half body along the in&s;ide of the Pila&s;ter, one oppo|&s;ite to another, the Head turned towards the Terra&s;s-Walk and Stair-Ca&s;e, or if you will towards the Plain. Beyond the&s;e two Pila&s;ters, there are two great Chamfered Pillars in front, and which in all appearance are what remains of four in Square. Then you find two other Pila&s;ters like to the fir&s;t, with each a Figure on them of an Animal in Demi-relief of the &s;ame height, and oppo&s;ite to one another on the in&s;ide; but the Figures of the&s;e &s;eem to be Griffons, and they are Back to Back with the Elephants, looking <HI>Ea&s;tward</HI> to the Hill, whereas the Elephants look <HI>We&s;tward</HI> to the Plain: the&s;e four Pila&s;ters with the Pillars &s;eem to have made a Portico.</P>
<P>Advancing a little forward, you find on the Right Hand a great Oblong Square Ba&s;on,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A great Ba|&s;on.</NOTE> two Fathom and a half in length, almo&s;t as much in breadth, and about three Foot deep, it is all of a greyi&s;h &s;tone.</P>
<P>Turning from thence to the Right Hand, and going about twenty &s;teps <HI>South|ward,</HI> you find a &s;econd Terra&s;s higher, which hath a jutting out in the middle, with a Stair-Ca&s;e on each &s;ide; there are two others at the two ends of the Ter|ra&s;s, but the&s;e four Stair-Ca&s;es are almo&s;t buried under Ground: neverthele&s;s, one may &s;till &s;ee &s;everal Figures upon &s;o much of the Terra&s;s-Walls as are above Ground. At the lea&s;t which is, (as I &s;aid,) by the jutting out in the middle, you
<PB N="143" REF="241">
&s;ee a Lion devouring a Bull: which is often repeated. By the other there are three Ranges of Bas-reliefs, repre&s;enting, (as I take it,) Sacrifices;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Bas-reliefs</HI> re|pre&s;enting Sa|crifices.</NOTE> for many per|&s;ons are there repre&s;ented as going in Proce&s;&s;ion, one after another, and Armed, &s;ome only with Swords and Daggers, others with Swords, Bows and Arrows, and others again &s;eem to be carrying Ve&s;&s;els. There you &s;ee al&s;o &s;everal kinds of Bea&s;ts, as Sheep, Oxen, Dromadaries, and other Animals.</P>
<P>When you are at the top of the&s;e Stairs, you come upon a Platform, where there are a great many Pillars, &s;ome buried under Ground, and others broken,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A place full of Pillars.</NOTE> and you only &s;ee the Ba&s;es of mo&s;t of them: neverthele&s;s, there are &s;eventeen &s;till &s;tanding, and the&s;e, with the others (whereof nothing but the Ba&s;es are to be &s;een,) make, (according to my account,) twelve Ranges, from <HI>Ea&s;t</HI> to <HI>We&s;t;</HI> and from <HI>South</HI> to <HI>North</HI> in breadth con&s;i&s;t of nine Pillars a piece: they are about &s;even Fathom high, and at three Fathom di&s;tance one from another, all Chamfered, and &s;ome with double Capitals: they are all of an extraordinary Order, which yet hath great affinity to the Dorick. It appears (by what remains upon &s;ome,) that all of them have &s;upported Statues, or perhaps, Idols; and at pre&s;ent they &s;erve the Storks to build their Ne&s;ts on.</P>
<P>Going on <HI>Southward</HI> from thence, you &s;ee a &s;quare Building,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A &s;quare building much adorned with <HI>Bas-reliefs.</HI></NOTE> and part of the Walls thereof &s;till &s;tanding. It is pierced on all &s;ides with Doors and Windows; which are embelli&s;hed with many Demi-reliefs, e&s;pecially the &s;ides of the Doors, which are of big greyi&s;h &s;tones, as the re&s;t of the Edifice is. Upon the&s;e &s;ides of the Doors, the Figures are much the &s;ame as on the re&s;t of the Building, and oppo&s;ite to one another; there you &s;ee an old Man followed by two Servants, one of them holding in both his Hands, a great Staff, with &s;even branches at the end of it, which uphold an Umbrello, ju&s;t over the Head of his Ma&s;ter: the other holds a Manipule in one Hand, and in the other a Cro&s;ier, or crooked Staff, liker to Cricket-&s;ticks, than the Cro&s;iers carried by Bi&s;hops; neverthele&s;s, by the way of holding it, one may judge that it is &s;omething re&s;embling a Bi&s;hops Cro&s;ier, for the Crook is carried up over the Ma&s;ters Head. In &s;ome of the&s;e Doors there is but one Servant; as in the one, he only, who carries the Manipule and the Cro|&s;ier, and in the others, he that holds the Umbrello. The Doors of the other two Faces are almo&s;t a like, and at the &s;ide of each Door on the in&s;ide, you &s;ee a Man fighting with a Bea&s;t, that is erected again&s;t him; with the Left Hand he holds a &s;hort Club over the Head of it, and with the Right &s;heaths a Dagger in its Belly, all the&s;e are to the natural bigne&s;s, nay &s;ome of them are bigger.</P>
<P>Next to this Building you &s;ee the ruins of a like Fabrick,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Buildings.</NOTE> but hardly any thing &s;tanding: on the &s;ides of the Doors within, there are &s;till to be &s;een two men, each holding a Pike, as if they Guarded the&s;e Doors: along the two &s;ides of the&s;e Buildings, there is a little Walk about a Fathom and a half broad, that runs betwixt the Building and a Wall; at the end of this la&s;t, (which is &s;o ruinous,) you find a double Stair-Ca&s;e cut in the Rock, but it is almo&s;t hid under the ruins, as well as the Wall betwixt the two, which &s;upports the Earth, and is full of Demi-reliefs, whereof there is no more but the Heads to be &s;een.</P>
<P>A little beyond that there is &s;quare Terra&s;s, not much rai&s;ed from the Ground,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A &s;quare Ter|ra&s;s.</NOTE> and &s;upported by a Wall which is al&s;o embelli&s;hed by &s;everal Figures in Demi-relief, that are half covered under Ground; and in this place there remain many round Ba&s;es: beyond that Terra&s;s that buts upon a large open places (which reaches length from <HI>We&s;t</HI> to <HI>Ea&s;t,</HI> as far as the Hill, and fronts towards the <HI>South,</HI>) there is no more now remaining; one comes down from thence by a pair of Stairs, which turning to the Left, you find at the &s;ide of the Terra&s;s, and are made in the Rock it &s;elf, that in this place &s;upports the Earth.</P>
<P>Returning back again to the &s;quare Building I mentioned, which is upon that Terra&s;s, where there are twelve ranges of Pillars of nine a piece; and from thence walking &s;treight <HI>Ea&s;t,</HI> when you have gone about an hundred paces, you find ano|ther Building of the &s;ame dimen&s;ions, &s;tanding directly oppo&s;ite to that you came from; and at the end of this Building, you find a &s;econd.<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Building.</NOTE> The Figures in Demi-relief which are upon the &s;ides of the Doors of the&s;e, and of the &s;ame bigne&s;s with the Figures on the other Doors, are not the &s;ame as to what they repre&s;ent. Here you have a Man &s;itting in a Chair, with a Batton in his Hand, and under his Feet three ranges of little Arches, made by Figures of a Foot height, laying their Arms
<PB N="144" REF="242">
upon one anothers Shoulders; over his Head there is an Idol, that repre&s;ents a Man with Wings, his body through a ring, and &s;itting upon an Arch; behind the Chair of the Man that &s;its, there is a &s;ervant holding a kind of Chalice.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Two Build|ings.</NOTE>Next to the&s;e Buildings, you find two others, and their Doors adorned with Figures much like to tho&s;e I have already de&s;cribed. On &s;ome are Men holding Pikes; on others you &s;hall &s;ee an old Man with a &s;ervant coming after him, and carrying a kind of Umbrello over his Head: in fine, there are Fights repre&s;ented on &s;ome of them.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Another Ter|ra&s;s.</NOTE>When you come out of the&s;e Buildings, you find a Terra&s;s directly oppo&s;ite to to that which I have mentioned, which puts a period to the fir&s;t rank of Build|ings, and is of the &s;ame contrivance; there al&s;o are to be &s;een &s;everal round Ba&s;es, it buts upon the &s;ame open place, that is at the Foot of the other, and into which, (I told you,) one may go down by a pair of Stairs cut out of the Rock, that is be|twixt the&s;e two Terra&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>You mu&s;t then go back again by all the&s;e Buildings, till you come to the fir&s;t of this &s;econd rank, out of which you come on the <HI>Ea&s;t</HI> &s;ide, in the &s;ame manner as you did when you came from the fir&s;t Buildings to the&s;e: and you come to other Buildings,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Two Build|ings.</NOTE> where you &s;ee on the Jams of the Doors Figures in Demi-relief, much like to tho&s;e you &s;aw in the former: (that is to &s;ay,) on &s;ome, Men with Pikes, and on others, Combats repre&s;ented in very great Figures; on &s;everal of them al&s;o, there is a Man &s;itting in a Chair, but the Figures about, &s;omewhat different from tho&s;e of the other Buildings; for the&s;e (in &s;ome places,) have &s;everal per&s;ons before and behind, that look towards the Man; and of tho&s;e who are behind him, one holds a Cro&s;ier over his Head. Over all there is a winged Idol, &s;uch as I have de&s;cribed; under the Feet of it there are five Ranges of Figures two Foot high, which make &s;o many ranks of little Arches, by laying their Arms upon one anothers Shoulders. In one of the Fronts of one of the&s;e la&s;t Buildings, there is but one per&s;on behind the Man that is &s;itting, who holds a Cro&s;ier over his Head;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Three Build|ings.</NOTE> the winged Idol is the &s;ame, but hath only three ranges of little Arches under its Feet.</P>
<P>In fine, after you have con&s;idered all the&s;e different Fabricks, or (to &s;ay more properly,) all the&s;e ruins, you are to go &s;treight to the Hill, which fronts to the <HI>We&s;t,</HI> and there you &s;ee a kind of Fronti&s;piece of a Temple, cut in the Rock, and two &s;tories high, of which the lowermo&s;t hath five Fathom in Front, and about two in height; this is the order of it. There are four Pillars that reach from the Ground to the top of this fir&s;t Fronti&s;piece, their Capitals on each &s;ide, being the <HI>Bu&s;t,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Fronti&s;|piece of a Temple.</NOTE> (that is to &s;ay,) the Head and Neck of an Ox. In the middle of the&s;e Pillars, (to wit,) betwixt the &s;econd and third, there is an Oblong &s;quare Door, about a Fathom high, and three Foot wide, though it opens not &s;o high, by a third part, becau&s;e the re&s;t of the opening is only a counterfeit upon the Rock: the&s;e Pillars &s;upport an Architrave re&s;embling much the Dorick Order, and at &s;everal di|&s;tances there are Lions all along it. Over this fir&s;t part of the Fronti&s;piece, there is a &s;econd,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The &s;econd Fronti&s;piece.</NOTE> a Fathom and a half high, and of the &s;ame breadth, but of pretty odd Architecture; for below, there are two &s;tories of Arches, made up of the Figures of Men, about two Foot high a piece, holding their Arms upon one anothers Shoulders: in the middle above, there is the Idol of a winged Man, in the po&s;ture that we have already repre&s;ented; upon five &s;teps on the Right Hand, there is another Man Praying to him; and on the Left there is a Pede&s;tal, on which nothing is to be &s;een, but a Globe on the top; at the two extremities there is a piece of a round very &s;mooth Pillar, which carries the Head of a Bull; and lower on each &s;ide of that &s;econd range, there are two Men one above another, the lowermo&s;t re&s;ting on the fir&s;t rank, and each of them holding a Pike. There is no going in at the Door below, becau&s;e it is always full of water, but a little farther towards the <HI>South,</HI> there is alike Fronti&s;piece with ju&s;t &s;uch another Door, into which one may enter; and there you &s;ee three Sepulchres cut in the Rock, which are &s;quare, and have a pretty near re&s;emblance to the Ba&s;ons of a Fountain;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sepulchres in the Rock.</NOTE> and in the middle of this Cave there is a &s;tone that &s;eems to be a Grave-&s;tone.</P>
<P>Thus you have a full account of that which is called <HI>T&s;chehel-minar</HI> that makes &s;o much noi&s;e: it is hard to give an exact de&s;cription of it; it may be &s;aid in ge|neral, that it con&s;i&s;ts chiefly in three Ranges of Buildings, behind one another from

It mu&s;t not be imagined that all the&s;e &s;tand in &s;treight lines, and are of an equal height; for &s;ome Terra&s;&s;es are higher than others, which I think I have &s;ufficiently intimated already in the particular de&s;cription I have given. Among&s;t all the&s;e Buildings there are &s;e|veral Canals under Ground, which have &s;erved for the conveying water: all together takes up a great &s;pace in Semicircle formed by the Hill where the two Sepulchres are. It is Terra&s;&s;ed in &s;everal places, e&s;pecially towards the Hill which is to the <HI>We&s;t.</HI> As to the ruins in particular, I have mentioned all that I could give any Idea of: but if the curious think it not enough, or that it is a little confu&s;ed, I pray them to con&s;ider, that if I had &s;aid more it would have been more confu&s;ed, and that it is very hard to ob&s;erve much order in the relation of things, which the proce&s;s of many Ages, the weather, and even the malice of Men, have put into extream confu&s;ion. Beyond <HI>T&s;chehel-minar,</HI> towards the <HI>South,</HI> there is a Pillar &s;tanding all alone, and to the <HI>North</HI> &s;ide a Gate by it &s;elf too.

<P>Fifty paces from thence there is a Fronti&s;piece like the former, but neither it, nor tho&s;e that follow are above a Fathom from the Ground, which in this place is much rai&s;ed with the time: under this Fronti&s;piece, there is Table of Bas-reliefs, reaching down to the Ground, whereon Men are repre&s;ented Fighting on Hor&s;e-back, but

The people of the Country &s;ay that this Hor&s;e-man is <HI>Ru&s;tan,</HI> who would carry away his own Daughter, and that his Son, the Maids Brother, be&s;eeches him to let her alone. Behind the Hor&s;e-man there is another great Figure &s;tanding upright, but much defaced; it hath a long Cap round at the top: this Figure is all over full of In&s;criptions which &s;eem to be <HI>Greek,</HI> but &s;o worn out that it cannot be Read: four &s;teps from thence there is another Fronti&s;piece, like the other two, at the bottom whereof there is a Bas-relief, but all defaced.

another neighbouring Hill beyond this, there was a Gate of a City which they call the City of <HI>Solomon:</HI> another at that Pillar I mentioned,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Town of <HI>Solomon.</HI></NOTE> which is to be &s;een on the Right Hand as you come from <HI>Mirchas-Chan;</HI> and a third on the other &s;ide of <HI>T&s;chehel-minar:</HI> if &s;o, that Town mu&s;t have had above eight <HI>Agat&s;ch</HI> in Circum|ference. As for <HI>T&s;chehel-minar,</HI> many are of Opinion that it was the Palace of the Kings of <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> who held their u&s;ual Re&s;idence in <HI>Per&s;epolis,</HI> which <HI>Alexander</HI> the Great, (being Drunk,) Burnt at the in&s;tigation of a Mi&s;s; but be&s;ides that this place is too little for the compa&s;s of a Palace, that might an&s;wer the magnificence of the Kings of <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> in tho&s;e days, the Tombs that are in the Hill &s;hew the con|trary; moreover &s;ince the&s;e places &s;eem never to have been covered, I had rather think, that it hath been &s;ome Temple, and that is probable enough, becau&s;e of the Pillars on which were Idols; and all know that the Temples of the Ancient <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> were uncovered. The&s;e Buildings have been &s;poilt, not only by the weather, but al&s;o by Men, e&s;pecially by a Governour of <HI>Schiras,</HI> whom covetou&s;ne&s;s prom|pted to make great havock of them, becau&s;e he was obliged to defray the charges of all whom Curio&s;ity brought thither to &s;ee them; which was like to have co&s;t him his Head, the King having been extreamly di&s;plea&s;ed at &s;o unworthy an action.</P>

<P>I Bargained with a Muletor at <HI>Schiras,</HI> to go to <HI>Bender-Rik</HI> at the rate of a <HI>To|man</HI> for five Mules (for that Road is not proper for Hor&s;es) which comes to ten <HI>Aba&s;&s;is</HI> apiece for the Mules;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Departure from <HI>Schiras</HI> to <HI>Bender-Rik.</HI></NOTE> and he obliged him&s;elf to carry us to <HI>Bender-Rik</HI> in &s;even days. I went in the Company of the Reverend Father <HI>Denys</HI> a <HI>Polander,</HI> Provincial of the bare-footed <HI>Carmelites,</HI> who had two with him, and I my &s;er|vant. We parted from <HI>Schiras, Munday</HI> the eight and twentieth of <HI>September,</HI> a little after midnight; and went out of the Town by the <HI>We&s;t</HI> Gate, which is cal|led the Gate of <HI>Ba&s;&s;ora,</HI> becau&s;e that is the way to it, though there be neither Gate nor Walls at the place. We took our way &s;treight <HI>We&s;t,</HI> Travelling in a Plain more fruitful in Bu&s;hes than any thing el&s;e: about three a Clock in the Morning, we pa&s;t by a little wretched <HI>Kervan&s;eray,</HI> where there are <HI>Rahdars,</HI> who demanded Toll of us; but we an&s;wered that we were <HI>Franks,</HI> and had an Order from the King not to pay any thing, only we made them a Pre&s;ent of five <HI>Casbeghis.</HI> This <HI>Kervan&s;eray</HI> is two <HI>Para&s;anges</HI> from <HI>Schiras,</HI> and is called <HI>T&s;chenar Rahdar,</HI> that is to &s;ay the <HI>Rahdars</HI> Maple, though there be no Maple-Trees there. Near to it there is a new built Bridge of three Arches, (as I take it,) under which runs a little water, but which in the Winter-time mu&s;t be impetuous; for near to that Bridge I &s;aw the ruins of another, which in all appearance hath been beat down by the water. This water is called <HI>Abt&s;chenar-Rahdar.</HI> We pa&s;t over that Bridge,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Abt&s;chenar-Rahdar.</NOTE> and half an hour after, cro&s;&s;ed another new one al&s;o of two Arches, over the &s;ame Ri|ver; near to which are al&s;o the ruins of another Bridge.

A quarter of an hour after, we pa&s;&s;ed by the ruins of a <HI>Kervan&s;eray,</HI> that had been very &s;pacious, and &s;eated upon the &s;ide of the &s;ame
<PB N="148" REF="245">
River, which in appearance beat it down al&s;o, though it &s;tood upon a pretty high Bank, the Chanel of the River being very deep at that place. A quarter of an hour after, we foarded over that River, and began to a&s;cend in a way that was pretty good, except in &s;ome pa&s;&s;es. About half an hour after five we cro&s;&s;ed a little Canal. About &s;ix a Clock we were got into a Plain all full of Heath, as the Hills about were; and had very good way. Half an hour after nine, we came to lovely running &s;treams,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The River of <HI>Preskiaft.</HI></NOTE> that come from a River called <HI>Preskiaft</HI> which waters the Country thereabout. About ten of the Clock we met with two ways, the one pretty narrow on a very &s;teep Hill, which has the &s;ame River running by the foot of it, that is very deep there, and if the Mules made a fal&s;e &s;tep in this way, (which is high above the River,) they would not fail to fall into it, and be in danger either of breaking their Necks or drowning. The other way is on the other &s;ide of the River, which may be cro&s;&s;ed in &s;everal places, where the water is &s;hallow; this was the way I took, becau&s;e it plea&s;ed my Mule &s;o to do, to whom I freely gave the Reins, being per&s;uaded that it was better acquainted with the Road than I was; one of our Company who followed the other way, had almo&s;t tumbled into the River, Mule and all together: perhaps the way that I took is covered with water in Winter, and &s;o there is a nece&s;&s;ity of going the Hill way. About half an hour after ten we came to a wretched <HI>Kervan&s;eray,</HI> which is no more but &s;ome &s;orry Vaults, all black with Soot and full of Hor&s;e and Pullets dung; however, we had &s;helter there. There are &s;ome <HI>Rahdars</HI> that live in that place, to whom we gave a few <HI>Ca&s;beghis,</HI> The River of <HI>Preskiaft</HI> runs in a bottom at the back of this <HI>Ker|van&s;eray,</HI> where there are four Arches remaining of a Bridge that has been in that place, which are mightily decayed; the water runs not under the&s;e Arches, but at the &s;ide of them, where the ruins of the re&s;t of the Bridge may &s;till be &s;een, which &s;eems to have been of eight Arches. The River is not very deep at that place; but very broad, and one may &s;ee that in Winter it &s;wells very high, and overflows a great part of the Country about,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hadgi-Zenon.</NOTE> This <HI>Kervan&s;eray</HI> is named <HI>Hadgi-Zenon,</HI> and is eight <HI>Para&s;anges</HI> or <HI>Agat&s;ch</HI> from <HI>Schiras.</HI>&mdash;</P>
<P>We parted from <HI>Hadgi-Zenon, Tue&s;day</HI> the nine and twentieth of <HI>September,</HI> at two a Clock in the Morning, and continued our way <HI>We&s;tward.</HI> We had not gone an hundred paces when we pa&s;t over a new Bridge of four Arches, under which runs the River <HI>Preskat:</HI> afterwards we found a great many lovely waters that fall down from the Hill, and I believe that in the Winter-time they overflow all the Land thereabouts which is very barren and &s;tony, bearing nothing but Heath, wild Che&s;s-Nuts, and &s;uch like Trees. Half an hour after three, we came to a Hill called <HI>E&s;tou Asbi;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">E&s;tou-Asbi.</NOTE> and having a good way to go up, an hour after, we came to the top of it, where there is a Lodge for <HI>Rahdars,</HI> whom we &s;atisfied with a Pre|&s;ent of a few <HI>Cosbeghis:</HI> then we had a little down Hill, till about &s;ix a Clock we came into a large Plain, full of water in the middle, that makes a Mari&s;h, which made us fetch a compa&s;s about for the &s;pace of two hours and above, to gain a very high Mountain (called <HI>Andgira,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Mount <HI>Andgi|ra.</HI></NOTE>) covered with Turpentine and other wild Trees; about a quarter after eight we were got there, and having pa&s;&s;ed by a <HI>Kervan&s;eray,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Chadgeghi.</NOTE> (called <HI>Chadgeghi,</HI>) at the foot of it, we mounted up a very &s;tony way for the &s;pace of a long hour; and then went down on the other &s;ide, till about eleven a Clock, when (finding good water,) we re&s;ted at half way down the Hill, under a Tree; there being no Lodging, but a kind of Cottage, where commonly lives a man that &s;ell Victuals, and who was not there at that time: it is &s;ix <HI>Para&s;anges</HI> from <HI>Hadgi-Zenon</HI> to this <HI>Menzil,</HI> for &s;o they call a Lodging place in tho&s;e Quarters.</P>
<P>We parted from thence on <HI>Wedne&s;day</HI> the la&s;t of <HI>September,</HI> about two of the Clock in the Morning, and having kept going down Hill &s;till about an hours time; we then Travelled on two hours <HI>We&s;tward</HI> in a great Plain; where there are a great many Oaks, and other wild Trees, which made the way, (that was of it &s;elf good,) very plea&s;ant:<NOTE PLACE="marg">De&s;tberm.</NOTE> Half an hour after five we came to a Lodge of <HI>Rahdars,</HI> which is at the end of the Plain, and is called <HI>De&s;tberm:</HI> commonly they make it a <HI>Menzil</HI> or days Journy from <HI>Chadgegih</HI> to <HI>De&s;tberm,</HI> becau&s;e of the trouble of climbing over the Mountain, which extreamly tires the Mules. There being no water in that place, but what is taken out of a bea&s;tly open Ci&s;tern, we gave the <HI>Rahdars</HI> &s;ome <HI>Casbeghis,</HI> and &s;o went on. A quarter of an hour after, we found a Sepulchre, in form of a &s;quare Chappel, covered with a <HI>Dome,</HI> and pretty near it two Ci&s;terns.

We went downwards afterwards,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chotal Ou&s;che|neck.</NOTE> by a very rugged de&s;cent called <HI>Chotal Ou&s;che|neck;</HI> in former times it was more rugged, and I believe that neither Men nor Bea&s;ts could pa&s;s it; but the Mother of <HI>Imam-Couli-Chan,</HI> Governour of <HI>Schiras,</HI> called <HI>Voli Naamet,</HI> cau&s;ed the pa&s;&s;age to be made as now it is. The Rock in many places is cut in the fa&s;hion of &s;teps, in other places it is Paved, and all over (where the way is &s;o narrow, that Bea&s;ts making a fal&s;e &s;tep were in danger of tumbling into a Precipice,) there is a Parapet made of &s;tone about a Foot and a half high, and a Foot thick, &s;o that now it is pa&s;&s;able, though a great way of it one mu&s;t alight and lead; being come to the bottom of that de&s;cent, for near three quarters of an hour we had very &s;tony way; and then came to a lovely Spring of water, which &s;preads &s;o over the Country, that with its waters it covers a very large Plain; it is called <HI>Abghine.</HI> We &s;aw that water the day before,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Abghine.</NOTE> from Mount <HI>Andgira</HI> though there be a great Hill betwixt them. We pa&s;&s;ed it at a narrow place upon a Bridge of two Arches, which is all ruinous, and is called <HI>Poul-Abghine.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Poul-Abghine.</NOTE> Having Travel|led on two hours and a half more, over a barren Plain, about half an hour after ten, we came to <HI>Karzerum,</HI> &s;ix <HI>Para&s;anges</HI> and a half from the la&s;t Stage.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Karzerum.</NOTE> <HI>Karzerum</HI> is a Town of many Hou&s;es, but all &s;o mi&s;erable, that in our Country the greate&s;t Com|pliment that could be put upon it, would be to call it <HI>Bourg</HI> or Village, becau&s;e it has a Market-place; it depends on the <HI>Vizir</HI> of <HI>Schiras,</HI> and is Commanded by a <HI>Kelonter;</HI> there are two or three good <HI>Kervan&s;erays</HI> it it; and the water they drink there, is brought above half a League from the Town, but both in it and the <HI>Kervan&s;erays</HI> there is water good enough for Bea&s;ts and the Kitchin. Here they would have &s;eized our Mules to carry Provi&s;ions for the King to <HI>I&s;pahan,</HI> but the Reverend Father Provincial, going to wait upon the <HI>Kelonter</HI> to repre&s;ent to him that we were <HI>Franks;</HI> &s;o &s;oon as the <HI>Kelonter</HI> &s;aw him, he ordered that our Mules &s;hould not be taken, becau&s;e we were &s;trangers.

<P>We parted from <HI>Karzerum, Friday</HI> the &s;econd of <HI>October</HI> at two of the Clock in the Morning, and Travelled on &s;till <HI>We&s;twards</HI> in very good way. Half an hour after four we pa&s;&s;ed by a &s;orry Village called <HI>Dris,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Dris.</NOTE> where they have no water to drink, but what is taken out of a little Lake. About &s;ix a Clock we pa&s;&s;ed by a little River that runs in a bottom, and there is a way along the &s;ide of it; we took not that way, but leaving both it and the River, &s;truck off to the Left Hand by a very &s;tony way; about &s;even a Clock we began to go up Hill in bad way, and a quarter of an hour after, found a Lodge of <HI>Rahdars,</HI> to whom we made a Pre&s;ent of &s;ome <HI>Casbeghis,</HI> and kept on mounting upwards, till about eight a Clock; and then having de&s;cended a little, we came into a very even Plain, but which produces nothing, though there be not one &s;tone in it. Having Travelled therein an hour, we pa&s;&s;ed by a Village called <HI>Kangh Turkon,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Kangh Turkon.

This Village is &s;ix <HI>Para&s;anges</HI> from <HI>Karzerum:</HI> we arrived there half an hour after nine, and Lodged in a Hou&s;e, that was lent us, for &s;ome &s;mall Gratuity; the water we drank there is taken out of a Well clo&s;e by.</P>
<P>We parted from that Village <HI>Saturday</HI> the third of <HI>October,</HI> half an hour after three a Clock in the Morning. A little after, we pa&s;&s;ed by a <HI>Kervan&s;eray,</HI> called <HI>Kervan&s;eray Khodgia Belfet;</HI> it is not opened but in the Winter-time,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Khodgia Belfet.</NOTE> when it Rains or Snows, the re&s;t of the Year it is &s;hut, and no body Lodges in it. We continued going <HI>We&s;tward,</HI> but the way was very bad: about four a Clock, the way was &s;o narrow, that only one Mule could pa&s;s at a time; it lyes betwixt two Hills that are very near one another, but it is not above an hundred paces long: immediately after we entered into another narrow pa&s;s among the Hills, where the way is no broader, and we went down Hill in very bad way, until three quarters of an hour after four: there we found a Caravan of &s;everal Mules and Camels, which were coming from <HI>Bender Rik,</HI> and we met with &s;everal others afterward every day. Then we went up Hill for about a quarter of an hour, and afterwards went down Hill again till &s;ix of the Clock, in very irk&s;ome way, and among&s;t dread|ful Precipices, being &s;teep black Rocks, where one is often forced to alight for fear of tumbling headlong. After that we had good way, but &s;till among&s;t Hills until half an hour after &s;ix, that we found a great broad and deep River,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Roudchone Bou|&s;chavir.</NOTE> called <HI>Roudchone Bou&s;chavir,</HI> the water of which ta&s;ts a little &s;weeti&s;h; the &s;ource of it is near the

There are many Villages thereabouts, and much Cultivated Land, &s;ome of which bears Tobacco; I al&s;o &s;aw in &s;everal places that fatal Shrub <HI>Kerzebreh.</HI> About ten a Clock we Foarded over a large Brook that falls into the River of <HI>Bou&s;chavir.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Bou&s;chavir. Sirt.</NOTE> This may very well be the River which <HI>San|&s;on</HI> marks in his Map, by the name of <HI>Sirt:</HI> we Foarded it again a quarter of an hour after, and then five times an end; &s;o that in le&s;s than half an hours time we cro&s;&s;ed it &s;ix times; having the water always up to the Mules Belly, for five or &s;ix, and in &s;ome places more than &s;even Fathom in breadth: it is &s;o broad and deep in Winter, that it can no ways be Foarded over; and then they mu&s;t go by a very narrow way cut out in the Hill on the Left Hand, which is very dangerous; for if the Mule make one fal&s;e &s;tep, it is lo&s;t for good and all. About three quarters after ten, we began to go up Hill in very bad way, and that during an hour and a quarter; we &s;ometimes al&s;o went down Hill, but not much, and always in very bad way, having the River on our Right Hand: certainly I never &s;aw wor&s;e way than what we had during that whole day.

<P>We parted from thence <HI>Sunday</HI> the fourth of <HI>October,</HI> half an hour after one in the Morning; and Travelled on <HI>We&s;tward</HI> in bad enough way. Three quarters after two we went down a very rugged way, but the wor&s;t is at fir&s;t, the re&s;t being pretty good, but that it is narrow, and upon the edge of an exceeding deep Pre|cipice, &s;o that the Mules are in the &s;ame danger as in tho&s;e we pa&s;t, which made us alight and lead down that de&s;cent: we got down about half an hour pa&s;t three, and a little after came into a very even Plain, and all Sowed Land: we Travelled on there <HI>Southward,</HI> until &s;even a Clock, when to the Right Hand we again found the River of <HI>Bou&s;chavir</HI> which we Foarded over; and &s;topt on the other &s;ide of the water. There is no Habitation there, and yet the place has a name, being called <HI>Sefid Rou;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Sefid Rou.</NOTE> it is four long <HI>Agat&s;ch</HI> from <HI>Kervan&s;eray Narghi&s;i.</HI></P>
<P>We parted from thence <HI>Munday</HI> the fifth of <HI>October,</HI> half an hour after four a Clock in the Morning, and holding &s;treight <HI>We&s;t</HI> we Travelled in a Plain; until eight a Clock, that we arrived at a pitiful <HI>Kervan&s;eray,</HI> which con&s;i&s;ts in three na&s;ty Chambers, and all black with Soot; it is called <HI>T&s;chah-Ghonbez,</HI> (that is to &s;ay,) the Well of the Vault; the water that is drank there is drawn out of a Well hard by. &s;ome hundred of paces di&s;tant there is a Village called <HI>Dehkone,</HI> (that is to &s;ay Old Village,) which is di&s;tant from <HI>Sefid-Rou</HI> three <HI>Agat&s;ch,</HI> and <HI>Sefid-Rou</HI> is not properly a <HI>Menzil,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">T&s;chah-Ghon|bez.</NOTE> but commonly they come from <HI>Kervan&s;eray Narghi&s;i</HI> to <HI>T&s;chah-Ghonbez</HI> in a day; our Muletor made us make two of it, that he might keep Company with his Brother, who was at <HI>Sefid-Rou,</HI> and Travelled but &s;mall Journies.</P>
<P>We parted from <HI>T&s;chah-Ghonbez, Tue&s;day</HI> the &s;ixth of <HI>October,</HI> at one a Clock in the Morning, and continued our way over a very even Plain, due <HI>We&s;t.</HI> A|bout half an hour after &s;ix, we Foarded over a Salt water, that was but &s;hallow: from that we had all along a Plain covered with Sand to <HI>Bender Regh,</HI> where we arrived about half an hour after nine; it is &s;even <HI>Agat&s;ch</HI> from <HI>T&s;chah-Ghonbez.</HI></P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. IX.</HI> Of the Voyage from <HI>Bender-Rik</HI> to <HI>Ba&s;&s;ora.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE day we arrived at <HI>Bender-Rik</HI> a Bark put out from thence in the Morning for <HI>Ba&s;&s;ora,</HI> and the &s;ame day two Barks came from <HI>Ba&s;&s;ora,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Letters from the <HI>Ba&s;ha</HI> of <HI>Ba&s;&s;ora.</HI></NOTE> which brought Letters to the Governour from the <HI>Ba&s;ha</HI> of that place; wherein he prayed him to &s;end him twelve Barks to fit out with Soldiers, for his defence again&s;t &s;even <HI>Ba&s;has,</HI> who by orders from the <HI>Grand Signior</HI> were preparing to attack him, becau&s;e he had not obeyed &s;ome Orders from the Port. This was very unplea&s;ant News to us, neverthele&s;s being re&s;olved to go to <HI>Ba&s;&s;ora</HI> whatever might happen; we agreed with the Patron of a Bark to pay him fifteen <HI>Aba&s;&s;is</HI> for the pa&s;&s;age of the Reverend Father Provincial, my &s;elf and three &s;ervants: but I mu&s;t fir&s;t de|&s;cribe the fa&s;hion of the&s;e Barks.</P>
<P>They are great Boats built much like the <HI>Germes</HI> of <HI>Egypt,</HI> which have no Deck,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Barks of <HI>Ben|der-Regh.</HI></NOTE> and are round in the in&s;ide: the Bark we went on Board of, was above &s;ix Fathom long, two Fathom broad, and no le&s;s in depth: there were two little Decks in the Stern, which made two &s;mall Cabins, one over another; he that &s;tood by the Helm was placed on the &s;econd; the other which was the lower, was no more but a Hurdle of Palm-Tree Branches laid upon &s;ticks that went cro&s;s-ways; and there was a Deck al&s;o in the Stem or Head: the &s;tern was higher than the Head, but was made &s;harp as well as it; the Ma&s;t was high and big, the Yard uniform, with a great Sail, and on each &s;ide there were four Oars, (that is to &s;ay &s;o many Poles,) with a board a Foot and a half long, and half a Foot broad, fa&s;tened with three Ropes to the end of each of them; but it is chiefly to be ob&s;erved, that there is not a bit of Iron in the&s;e Barks; the truth is,<NOTE PLACE="marg">They have not a bit of Iron.</NOTE> ours had an Anchor of Iron, but it was a thing extraordinary, becau&s;e commonly they are only of Wood. The Planks of the Barks are fa&s;tened together by &s;mall Cords, that go through holes made in them; and that they may hold &s;ure, and the Cords keep &s;treight, they drive little pegs of Wood into the holes, which pre&s;s the little Cords very hard: be&s;ides they put in the in&s;ide at the joyning of the Planks a twi&s;t or double of the&s;e &s;mall Lines about three Fingers thick, which is fa&s;tened to the two Planks by other little Lines; and of the&s;e there is one at each &s;eam or joyning of the Planks, from the upper &s;ide of the Bark down to the Keel; and over and above that, there is a Girdle al&s;o on the in&s;ide which goes all round her: all the&s;e Cords are made of Palm-Tree, and that they may not be damaged by the water, nor the Bark leak, they cover all over with Pitch. In &s;hort,<NOTE PLACE="marg">They have no Sea-Compa&s;s.</NOTE> a Compa&s;s would be of great u&s;e to one of the&s;e Barks, but they u&s;e none, for they commonly keep within fight of Land, and in the night-time are guided by the Stars. Neverthele&s;s the Sea-men of our Bark told me, that &s;he had co&s;t twenty <HI>Tomans,</HI> which is not to be thought &s;trange, &s;eeing Timber is dear at <HI>Bender-Rik</HI> and <HI>Ba&s;&s;ora.</HI> They al&s;o told me that the u&s;ual burden of &s;uch a Bark was four hundred Bales of Dates; each Bale being commonly twelve <HI>Mans</HI> of <HI>Tauris;</HI> &s;o that the&s;e
<PB N="152" REF="247">
Barks carry, according to that account four thou&s;and eight hundred common <HI>Mans</HI> of <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> which make twenty eight thou&s;and eight hundred weight.</P>
<P><HI>Thur&s;day</HI> the eighth of <HI>October</HI> they gave us notice to go on board; and we went on Foot along the water-&s;ide to our Bark which was half a <HI>Far&s;akh</HI> di&s;tant, that is to &s;ay about half a <HI>French</HI> League;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Far&s;akh.</NOTE> for <HI>Far&s;akh, Farfange,</HI> and <HI>Para&s;ange</HI> &s;ignifie one and the &s;ame thing, and we went on board at Noon: &s;eeing &s;he was empty, as being &s;ent only to bring Dates from <HI>Ba&s;&s;ora,</HI> we had room enough; though I believe Pa&s;&s;engers are much &s;treightned in the&s;e Barks when they are loaded, for they mu&s;t lie upon the Goods as high as the &s;ide of the Bark. We had eight Sea-men on board, be&s;ides the Ma&s;ter, and we put off as &s;oon as we were on board, by the help of two of the Company, who wading up to the Belly in the water Towed us, whil&s;t the re&s;t Rowed: three hours after we &s;topt near the &s;hoar on our Right Hand, to take in Sand for Balla&s;t; they took in fifty <HI>Couffes</HI> or Basketfuls on Head, and as much a Stern; and then rai&s;ed their Ma&s;t and fitted all their Tackle, by the time they had put all in order, it was &s;ix of the Clock at Night, and then we &s;et Sail with an <HI>Ea&s;terly</HI> Wind; and &s;tanding away <HI>South-We&s;t,</HI> we pre&s;ently got out of that long Channel, the mouth of it bearing <HI>South-We&s;t;</HI> and keeping on the &s;ame cour&s;e, we lo&s;t &s;ight of Land on the Starboard &s;ide; but &s;aw Land to the Larboard, as long as we had day-light: all night long we bore away &s;ometimes <HI>South-We&s;t,</HI> &s;ometimes <HI>North-We&s;t,</HI> beating too and again with the &s;ame Wind, but &s;o &s;mall that it was almo&s;t a Calm.</P>
<P><HI>Friday</HI> the ninth of <HI>October</HI> at break of day, we &s;aw the Land near to us on the Right Hand, and we were becalmed till about ten a Clock in the Morning, when we had an ea&s;ie <HI>South-We&s;t</HI> Gale, with which we &s;tood off a little from the &s;hoar, bearing away <HI>North-We&s;t:</HI> we made &s;o good way with this Gale, that at one of the Clock after Noon,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Bender-Delem.</NOTE> we were off and on with <HI>Bender-Delem;</HI> and about &s;ix a Clock in the Evening we weathered a little point of Land, which (they &s;ay) is half way from <HI>Bender-Rik</HI> to <HI>Ba&s;&s;ora,</HI> but about half an hour afrer &s;even, the Wind all of a &s;udden &s;hifted about to the <HI>North-We&s;t;</HI> and therefore we Fur|led our Sail and came to an Anchor. We were a little to&s;&s;ed during the whole night.</P>
<P>Next day being <HI>Saturday</HI> the tenth of <HI>October,</HI> half an hour after &s;ix in the Morning, we weighed Anchor, and made Sail, though the Wind was &s;till at <HI>North-We&s;t,</HI> and we &s;tood away <HI>South-We&s;t.</HI> About eight a Clock perceiving the Sea to be all over white, I asked the rea&s;on of it, and our Sea-men told me it was becau&s;e the water was &s;hallow; and indeed, we had no more but five foot water, though we were at a pretty good di&s;tance from Land: but &s;ome time after when I found that they had four Fathom water, and that the water was &s;till white, I asked them again the rea&s;on of it, and they could tell me no other, but that it was always &s;o in that place. The <HI>North-We&s;t</HI> Wind blowing &s;till, they ca&s;t Anchor; for it was contrary to us, becau&s;e in that place the Land bears <HI>Northward,</HI> and then turns again towards <HI>Ba&s;&s;ora,</HI> making a kind of Semicircular Bay. From the place where we were at Anchor we made Land, but &s;o ob&s;curely that it appeared only to be Clouds. After much enquiry and many que&s;tions, I got it out of our Patron at length, that we were off and on with the mouth of a River, which, (as he &s;aid,) was called <HI>Endian,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Endian.</NOTE> and runs by a Village of the &s;ame name; where there are many Hou&s;es but not contiguous, there being twenty in one place, thirty in ano|ther, and all upon the Banks of the River: that from <HI>Bender-Delem</HI> to the Village of <HI>Endian,</HI> it is three days Journy; that the Village of <HI>Endian</HI> depends on the Go|vernour of <HI>Schiras,</HI> and that it is five or &s;ix hours Travelling from the Sea, being near the River <HI>Endian,</HI> which is half as broad as the <HI>Tygris</HI> at <HI>Ba&s;&s;ora.</HI> This was all I could get out of that Man, and that was not a little; for it required time to pump &s;o much from him: whence one may judge how difficult a thing it is to get an exact knowledge of the&s;e Countries, and it is not to be thought &s;trange that the ways we have of them are full of errours, mo&s;t of them being made, upon the relation of people who not under&s;tanding the Language, can hardly inform them&s;elves of the people of the Country, otherwi&s;e than by &s;igns, and &s;ome words which here and there, they under&s;tand, and &s;o are apt to take one thing for ano|ther. Half an hour after &s;even at night we weighed Anchor, and kept upon Tacks, &s;ometimes <HI>South-We&s;t,</HI> &s;ometimes <HI>North-Ea&s;t;</HI> but the Wind blowing fre&s;h about midnight, we furled Sail, and came to Anchor in &s;ix Fathom and a
<PB N="153" REF="247">
half water. We were extreamly to&s;&s;ed all night long, and I wondered that the Bark &s;prang not a Leak, being &s;o beaten by the waves.</P>
<P>Next day being <HI>Sunday</HI> the eleventh of <HI>October,</HI> we weighed about &s;even a Clock, and kept beating upon a Wind from <HI>South-We&s;t,</HI> to <HI>North-Ea&s;t,</HI> until Noon, that we had calm weather: at length, about half an hour after two, we had a breeze from <HI>South-We&s;t;</HI> which made us weigh Anchor in good earne&s;t, and &s;tand away <HI>North We&s;t.</HI> It is to be ob&s;erved that in all that Voyage we had not above two, three, four, or &s;ix Fathom water at mo&s;t, though we were &s;o far out at Sea, that we could not di&s;cover the Land but like Clouds. About &s;ix a Clock at night we were becalmed, and came to an Anchor. About midnight we had a fre&s;h Gale from <HI>North-We&s;t.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Monday</HI> Morning the twelfth of <HI>October,</HI> the Wind &s;lackned very much, but changed not; and therefore we weighed Anchor at half an hour after eight; and &s;tanding away <HI>South-We&s;t,</HI> we were &s;oon after becalmed. Towards Noon we Rowed a little, and half an hour after, had a breeze from <HI>South-We&s;t,</HI> with which we bore away <HI>North-We&s;t</HI> till three in the Afternoon, when we entered into the Ri|ver <HI>Caron,</HI> that comes from the Hills, above the Town <HI>Sou&s;ter,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Caron.

<P>The u&s;ual way to <HI>Ba&s;&s;ora</HI> is by Sea, to the mouth of <HI>Schat-el-Aarab,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The way to <HI>Ba&s;&s;ora.</HI></NOTE> which they enter and go by water to <HI>Ba&s;&s;ora;</HI> but we put in to the River, becau&s;e our Sea-men, (who had nothing to do at <HI>Ba&s;&s;ora,</HI>) being only come to take in Dates, impo&s;ed upon us, telling us that we mu&s;t go to <HI>Gheban,</HI> to take in fre&s;h water and wood, which we wanted, and that it was al&s;o the &s;horte&s;t cut to <HI>Ba&s;&s;ora;</HI> but that great Barks went not that way, becau&s;e it was not deep enough, which we too ea&s;ily believed. So &s;oon as we were got into the River, we came to Anchor in a Fathom water. At low water the River at that place is but very little &s;alt, and a little higher it is fre&s;h even when it is Flood. Being Flood about midnight, our men fell to their Oars, but Rowed not above an hour, and then came to an Anchor. The Country about &s;eems to be very good Land, it is low, even and green on all Hands, and we &s;aw many Cows there feeding in the Meadows, which look much like the Mea|dows of <HI>Holland.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Tue&s;day</HI> the thirteenth of <HI>October,</HI> about ten a Clock in the Morning, our Sea-men went a &s;hoar, and Towed us up till one of the Clock, when being over again&s;t a Village, where there are a great many Palm-Trees, we hoi&s;ted Sail with a <HI>North-We&s;t</HI> Wind that la&s;ted not long, and &s;o came to an Anchor again. Our men went a &s;hoar, to hear News, (as they &s;aid,) of <HI>Ba&s;&s;ora,</HI> and coming back in the Evening told us, that all things were in confu&s;ion at <HI>Ba&s;&s;ora;</HI> that the <HI>Ba|&s;ha</HI> was marched with his whole Army towards <HI>Bagdad,</HI> and that all Barks were taken up for Tran&s;porting of Soldiers, and that therefore they dur&s;t go no farther; but were re&s;olved to return empty to <HI>Bender-Rik.</HI> This was all fal&s;e,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A cheat of the Sea-men.</NOTE> and the truth was, they had no mind to go any farther, de&s;igning to take in their Car|goe at the place we were at, where there is plenty of Dates; and that was the rea&s;on they had brought us that way.</P>
<P>Neverthele&s;s we mu&s;t pretend to believe all the Knaves told us, and try to find another Bark, to carry us to <HI>Ba&s;&s;ora.</HI> We &s;ent then a &s;ervant next day to look for one, and he brought us a &s;mall thing, wherein the men promi&s;ed in four and twenty hours to carry us to the Town, for &s;ix <HI>Aba&s;&s;is</HI> which we gave them.

<P>We embarked in one of the&s;e Boats about half an hour after three in the After|noon; it was full of a kind of very long green Ru&s;hes that have a great point at the end, whereof they make very fine mats. Our Crew con&s;i&s;ted of two Sea-men and a Ma&s;ter; the two men Towed us on Land till half an hour after &s;ix, that we came before a Village to the Left Hand; there we ca&s;t Anchor, our Men un|loaded all the Ru&s;hes, and going afterwards to the Village, we we &s;aw no more of them till next day. This is a great Village, and has a &s;quare Ca&s;tle with eight Towers; to wit one at each corner, and one in the middle of each &s;ide; but they are all of Earth, and &s;o thin that a double Musket could batter them all down. This place is called <HI>Koutmian,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Koutmian.</NOTE> (that is to &s;ay Ca&s;tle <HI>Mian,</HI>) and they make many <HI>Danegs</HI> there. The Country of <HI>Gheban</HI> reaches from thence to the mouth of the River of <HI>Caron;</HI> and in all that &s;pace, the Land on both &s;ides the River is called <HI>Gheban:</HI> it is very good Soil, and if Cultivated, would produce any thing; but is is neglected through the Lazine&s;s of the Inhabitants, who con|tent them&s;elves with their Dates, there being in that Country va&s;t Woods of Palm-Trees.</P>
<P>We parted from <HI>Koutmian Thur&s;day</HI> the fifteenth of <HI>October,</HI> half an hour after eight in the Morning; and at fir&s;t put over to the other &s;ide of the River, where our Men went a &s;hoar to Towe us, our cour&s;e being due <HI>North-We&s;t.</HI> At that place the River grows pretty broad, and I think is as broad as the River of <HI>Seine</HI> at <HI>Paris;</HI> and yet is very deep, and makes many I&s;lands. About Eleven a Clock we &s;topt at a Village to the Left Hand on the water &s;ide, from whence we parted at one of the Clock. About half an hour after nine at night, we &s;aw to our Right Hand the end of the I&s;le <HI>Dorghe&s;tan,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Dorghe&s;tan.

We &s;topped before a Ca&s;tle called <HI>Kout&s;chemal,</HI> which &s;tands on the main Land, near the end of that I&s;land, and on the &s;ame Hand. This is a very large Ca&s;tle, and the <HI>Ba&s;ha</HI> of <HI>Ba&s;&s;ora</HI> has a Palace in it, which (as I was told,) is very beautiful, and (as &s;ome &s;ay,) he keeps his Trea&s;ure there. Over again&s;t this Ca&s;tle, (but a little higher, on the other &s;ide of the water.) there is another &s;quare Ca&s;tle, with a Tower at each Angle.</P>
<P>We parted from that place <HI>Friday</HI> the &s;ixteenth of <HI>October</HI> at &s;ix of the Clock, and having the Wind at <HI>South,</HI> we made Sail and &s;tood away <HI>North-We&s;t.</HI> A quar|ter after eleven,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Kout-Muethel.</NOTE> we pa&s;&s;ed by a &s;quare Ca&s;tle, (called <HI>Kout-Muethel,</HI>) which was on our Left Hand, and is flanked with eight Towers, one at every corner, and one in the middle of each &s;ide; and near to it there is a little Canal. A little farther we &s;aw a Straw-Hou&s;e, where Officers of the Cu&s;toms live, who did not vi&s;it us, but only ordered our Ma&s;ter to carry us to the Cu&s;tom Hou&s;e of <HI>Ba&s;&s;ora.</HI> Leaving then the River of <HI>Caron</HI> we entered into a Canal called <HI>Haffar,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Haffar.</NOTE> which was to our Left Hand, or to the <HI>South-We&s;t</HI> of us; at that place it is not two Fathom over, in other places it is le&s;s, but towards the middle is very broad: it hath been

made for a Communication betwixt the River of <HI>Schat-El-Aarab,</HI> and the <HI>Caron:</HI> there is good Land on each &s;ide of that Canal, but it is not Cultivated, and bears only plenty of Date-Trees. The Canal makes many turnings, it is very deep, and our Men &s;hoved the Bark forwards with Poles. Three quarters of an hour after Noon, we &s;aw a Canal to the Right Hand, which lo&s;es it &s;elf in the Fields; and a little after, another to the Left, that runs into the <HI>Caron</HI> near to <HI>Kout-Mnuethel,</HI> as I &s;aid before; and then our Men went on &s;hoar to Towe us. There the Canal of <HI>Haffar</HI> grows very broad, and at the end is above &s;even or eight Fathom over. About four a Clock we &s;aw a Canal that &s;pends it &s;elf in the Fields.

We then en|tered into the River made up of the <HI>Tygris</HI> and <HI>Euphrates</HI> joyned into one; the <HI>Arabs</HI> call it <HI>Schat-El- Aarab,</HI> that is to &s;ay, the River of <HI>Aarabs.</HI> We turned then to the Right Hand, and &s;tood away <HI>North-We&s;t,</HI> having to our Left the I&s;le <HI>Dgezirak-Chader,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Dgezirak-Cha|der.</NOTE> and &s;eeing we had a breeze of Wind from the <HI>South</HI> we &s;pread our Sail. Half an hour after five in the Evening, we &s;aw to our Left the end of the I&s;le called <HI>Dgezirak-Chader,</HI> which reaches from the Canal by which they go to <HI>Bahrem,</HI> to the mouth of <HI>Schat-El-Aarab;</HI> there are Palm-Trees; yet their Soil is not good, but from the Canal of <HI>Bahrem,</HI> till over again&s;t, or a little above the Canal <HI>Haffar:</HI> for from thence to the Sea, the Land is barren, perhaps becau&s;e it being very low the Sea overflows it at high water. Next to the I&s;lle <HI>Chader</HI> we &s;aw on our Left Hand the Canal, by which they go to Port <HI>Calif</HI> and <HI>Bahrem;</HI> it runs towards the <HI>South,</HI> and pa&s;&s;es betwixt the I&s;le <HI>Chader</HI> and the main Land of <HI>Ba&s;|&s;ora;</HI> it is very broad, and has above eight Fathom water; but there are great &s;tones in &s;ome places of it. From thence to <HI>Ba&s;&s;ora</HI> the River is above twice and a half as broad as the <HI>Seine</HI> is at <HI>Paris,</HI> and yet is very deep all over. Three quar|ters after &s;ix we &s;aw on our Right Hand the beginning of a long I&s;land called <HI>Dgezirat-el-Bouarin;</HI> and a little after, we had on the &s;ame hand, the I&s;le <HI>El-Bocha&s;i,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Dgezirat-el-Bouarin.

The&s;e are all great I&s;lands, full of Palm-Trees, and neverthele&s;s the Channel is every where very deep and broad. The Wind &s;lackened &s;o at this place, that we &s;carcely made any way at all: however we drew near to the &s;hoar on the Left Hand or <HI>We&s;t</HI> &s;ide; and about half an hour after eight, our Men took their Oars, and Rowed till three quarters after ten at night, when we &s;topt clo&s;e by the &s;hoar before a Ca&s;tle of the <HI>Ba&s;has</HI> that &s;eems to be very lovely; it has many Pavillions all made into Windows and Por|ticos for taking the fre&s;h Air in the Summer-time; and indeed, the&s;e Ca&s;tles are only for plea&s;ure, for they could make no great defence.</P>
<P>We parted from that place <HI>Saturday</HI> the &s;eventeenth of <HI>October,</HI> at &s;ix a Clock in the Morning: half an hour after, we entered into a Canal to the Left Hand, which runs <HI>South-We&s;t;</HI> we had on our Left Hand a very &s;pacious Ca&s;tle, pretty entire on the &s;ide of the Canal, but all ruinous towards the Sea-&s;ide. This Canal at high water, is as broad as one half of the <HI>Seine,</HI> but when the Tide is out, it is but a &s;orry Brook full of Mud. The Town of <HI>Ba&s;&s;ora</HI> lies on the two &s;ides of this Canal, though along the &s;ides of it, there be nothing to be &s;een but Gardens, the Hou&s;es being backwards. We came along that Canal, till eight a Clock in the Morning, when we arrived at the Cu&s;tom-Hou&s;e, which is al|mo&s;t at the bottom of it; and having had our Goods viewed, we went to Lodge with the Reverend Fathers the bare-footed <HI>Carmelites,</HI> which is not far di|&s;tant; at that time there was but one Religious <HI>Italian</HI> there,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Arrival at <HI>Ba&s;|&s;ora.</HI></NOTE> called Father <HI>Severin.</HI></P>

<P><HI>Signor Emanuel Mendez Henriquez,</HI> Agent for the King of <HI>Portugal</HI> at <HI>Congo,</HI> hath often told me the way how they draw this water, which is thus.<NOTE PLACE="marg">An extraordi|nary way of drawing fre&s;h water out of the bottom of the Sea.</NOTE> The Barks go near to the place where the Springs are, which they know by the bearing of the I&s;land: at high water, there is two Fathom water in tho&s;e places, but when the Sea is out, they have not above three Foot water, and many times they are on dry Ground: for <HI>Bahrem</HI> is encompa&s;&s;ed with Banks of Sand, that run out a great way, where there are &s;uch flats that Ve&s;&s;els cannot pa&s;s them: but among&s;t the&s;e Banks there are deep Channels, which the Ve&s;&s;els keep; and what&s;oever &s;torm may blow at Sea, the Ve&s;&s;els that are in the&s;e Channels are &s;afe and &s;ecure. When the&s;e Barks are come near the Wells, they &s;tay till low water, and then they plant two Oars in the Sand, one on each &s;ide of the Well where they intend to water at; then they &s;train a Rope under water from one Oar to the other. We mu&s;t know that upon every one of the&s;e Wells, the <HI>Arabs</HI> have always the half of a Jarr, to wit the upper half where the mouth is, which may be called an Earthen Pipe; they put the wider end upon the mouth of the Spring, and thru&s;t it down above four inches in the Sand; they dawb it be&s;ides, all round with Pla&s;ter and Bitumen, that the Salt water may not get in: when the&s;e half Jars break or are worn out, they take care to put another in the place of them; after that the Fi&s;her|men then have planted the Oars, and fa&s;tened the Rope, a Man goes down into the Sea, with a Borrachio &s;topt, and Diving down his Head, puts him&s;elf under the &s;trained Rope, that &s;o the force of the fre&s;h water, that gu&s;hes out of the Jarr may not rai&s;e him up again; for it gu&s;hes out with great impetuo&s;ity; and then he claps the mouth of his Borrachio to the mouth of the Jarr, which being narrow and opened, is immediatly filled with fre&s;h water; when it is full, he he &s;tops it again, and brings it up to the Bark, where he empties his fre&s;h water, and then goes down again for more, till the Bark be &s;upplied. This <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> Gentleman told me that it was very ea&s;ie to be done, and that he him&s;elf had been &s;o curious as to go and fill a Borrachio there.</P>

of the Sea and picking up the Shell-Fi&s;h or <HI>Nacres,</HI> and the re&s;t &s;erve to draw them up, for all are not Divers. The Barks go fifteen, twenty, or thirty Leagues off of <HI>Bahem,</HI> along the Coa&s;t, and when they are at a place where they think there may be good Fi&s;hing, they come to an Anchor in five Fathom water; and then two Divers make ready one on each &s;ide, to go down for <HI>Nacres.</HI> All their preparatives con&s;i&s;t in &s;tripping them&s;elves naked, and taking a piece of Horn cloven in the manner of a pair of Pincers, as the Gentleman repre&s;ented it to me, which they always hang about their Necks by a piece of Pack thread; before they jump into the water they put it upon their No&s;e like a pair of Spectacles, and that keeps their No&s;trils &s;o clo&s;e that the water cannot enter them, nor can they fetch breath above water by the No&s;e neither. Be&s;ides this accoutrement, every Diver provides him&s;elf of a great &s;tone, which he fa&s;tens to a long Rope, and of a Basket tied to another; and puting the Rope to which the &s;tone is tied be|twixt the Toes of one of his Feet, and taking the Basket in his Hand, he leaves the ends of the two Ropes on Board, and Dives into the Sea. The &s;tone carries him immediately to the bottom, where being come, he ca&s;ts loo&s;e the Rope of the &s;tone from his Foot, which they on Board pull up, and without lo&s;iing time he quickly picks up all the <HI>Nacres</HI> he &s;ees, and puts them in his Basket, and when it is full, comes up again. The re&s;t hall up the Basket, whil&s;t he takes a little breath, and &s;moaks a Pipe of Tobacco; and having done &s;o he returns again to the bot|tom in the &s;ame manner, coming and going &s;o from eight a Clock in the Morning till Eleven. Then he goes to Dinner, with his comrades and feeds on <HI>Pilau</HI> and Dates, which are their common Food; and about Noon he goes a Diving again, and continues at work till three a Clock, but no longer, becau&s;e the water is then too cold. When they have got on Board a good quantity of the&s;e <HI>Nacres,</HI> they unload them upon &s;ome bank of Sand, and there open them, every one having an Iron In&s;trument purpo&s;ely for that; the Ma&s;ter of the Bark, in the mean time, never taking his Eyes off of them, lea&s;t they might purloin a Pearl, for if they be not carefully lookt to, they will cunningly whip them into their Mouth as &s;oon as they have opened the <HI>Nacre.</HI> Now if the Ma&s;ter made them open them on Board, it would be wor&s;e &s;till; for if any of them found a fair Pearl, he would nimbly throw the <HI>Nacre</HI> down into the hold without being perceived, and when the Bark were to be made clean, he would not fail to be Swabber, and throwing all the Shells and Fi&s;h into the Sea, (for they know not what it is to make any Works of Mother of Pearl) he would hide the Pearls he had thrown down, and then go &s;ell them for a &s;mall matter in the Town; and (which would be wor&s;t of all,) he would Work no more after; becau&s;e when the&s;e Blades have once got at little mony by &s;uch means, it is not po&s;&s;ible to make them Fi&s;h any more; &s;o long as it la&s;ts.</P>

They &s;ay that the <HI>Jews</HI> knowing by their Books, that Bapti&s;m was to de&s;troy their Law, were &s;o malicious, as that when St. <HI>John</HI> was about to Bapti&s;e our Lord, they threw into <HI>Jordan</HI> a good deal of <HI>Indico,</HI> thereby to &s;poil the water; but that God &s;ent an Angel with a Ve&s;&s;el full of pure clean water, taken out of another place of the River of <HI>Jordan,</HI> wherewith St. <HI>John</HI> Bapti&s;ed our Lord; and that from that time forward God cur&s;ed the blew colour. This is the opinion of the Vulgar, but one of them told me, that the rea&s;on why they hated that colour is, becau&s;e there is Dogs Turd u&s;ed in dying of it, and they look upon a Dog to be an unclean Bea&s;t.

I took care to carry on Board with me a good large Jarr, which I had filled with very good water. Such as under&s;tand the benefit of this, never fail to do &s;o; it is covered with a wooden cover, and &s;hut with a Padlock; and is very u&s;eful, when fre&s;h water begins to be &s;carce on Board; for then every one betakes him&s;elf to his Jarr; and though the Captain had laid in good &s;tore of fre&s;h water, yet we had rea&s;on to apprehend a &s;carcity, becau&s;e be&s;ides a great many people, we had ten Hor&s;es, &s;everal Sheep, Goats, and Pullets on Board.

At length the Merchant being gone, we weighed Anchor, but for a very &s;hort while; for we were obliged to drop it again at midnight, becau&s;e we could not advance but by the help of the Tide; &s;o that it behoved us to &s;tay for the Ebb before we weighed, and come to an Anchor again when it made Flood: and this cour&s;e we were forced to take, not only till New Moon, which changed not till <HI>Saturday</HI> the &s;eventh of <HI>November,</HI> becau&s;e of the <HI>South-Ea&s;t</HI> Wind that blew till that time; but al&s;o for &s;ome days after the New Moon, though the Wind was got about to <HI>North-We&s;t,</HI> becau&s;e it was too ea&s;ie to &s;erve our turn. Be&s;ides, the di&s;|&s;en&s;ion that was on Board the Ship was a great hinderance to us, for the Captain was of one mind, and the two Pilots each of another, all the Merchants likewi&s;e putting in for their &s;hare in advi&s;ing, This made the greater confu&s;ion, that one &s;poke <HI>Armenian,</HI> another <HI>Indian,</HI> a third <HI>Per&s;ian,</HI> a fourth <HI>Turki&s;h,</HI> and a fifth <HI>Por|tugue&s;e;</HI> in&s;omuch that mo&s;t commonly they under&s;tood not what one another &s;aid, which made a confu&s;ion among&s;t them, like that which God &s;ent among&s;t the builders of the Tower of <HI>Babel.</HI></P>
<P>All that I thought fit to ob&s;erve in this Voyage till we got out to Sea, is that we pa&s;t betwixt the main Land of <HI>Ba&s;&s;ora,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">El-Feyadi. Bochali. Bouarin.</NOTE> and the I&s;le <HI>El-Feyadi,</HI> having that I&s;le to the Larboard, as well as <HI>Bochali</HI> and <HI>Bouarin.</HI> Two men did nothing but heave out the Lead, to know how many Fathom water we had, and mo&s;t commonly they found three, four, or five Fathom: neverthele&s;s, <HI>Monday</HI> the ninth of <HI>No|vember,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Chader.</NOTE> our Ship &s;truck a ground, at the point of the I&s;le of <HI>Chader,</HI> which lyes towards the River that goes to <HI>Bahrem;</HI> having but there eleven Foot water, a Foot le&s;s than two Fathom, and the Ship drew at lea&s;t twelve Foot water. This obliged us to wait till next Flood carryed us off; and then we left that I&s;land to the Star|board. About &s;even a Clock at night we pa&s;t by the mouth of the Channel

<HI>Haffar,</HI> which was to our Larboard; and there begins the I&s;le of <HI>Gban,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">I&s;le of <HI>Gban.</HI></NOTE> which reaches from that place to the Sea.</P>
<P><HI>Tue&s;day</HI> the tenth of <HI>November,</HI> the Tide of Ebb beginning an hour before day, we weighed Anchor, and continued our cour&s;e betwixt the I&s;le <HI>Chader,</HI> and the I&s;le <HI>Gban,</HI> and there we found the water bracki&s;h. At this place the Palm-Trees end; and the Land on both &s;ides is only level and barren Plains, and &s;o low, that at high water they are almo&s;t all overflown: about two hours after day, the water ca&s;t us &s;o much upon the Land on the <HI>South</HI> &s;ide, that our Poop raked the &s;hoar; and that is in a manner unavoidable in this place, where all Ships are forced a &s;hoar; neverthele&s;s, though we were &s;o near, we had two Fathom water a Stern, and three a Head; and the current of the water drove us forward at a great rate: in the mean time our men did what they could to get out again into the Channel, and at length with the help of our Boat that Towed us, they accompli&s;hed it: We found three <HI>Mahometan</HI> Ships which &s;et out the &s;ame day that we did from <HI>Ba&s;&s;ora,</HI> and all three had had the &s;ame luck, having been by the force of the &s;tream ca&s;t a &s;hoar as well as we. The Cour&s;e we &s;tood from <HI>Ba&s;&s;ora</HI> till we came to the Sea, was in the beginning, whil&s;t we had the Wind at <HI>South-Ea&s;t, South, South We&s;t,</HI> and after we had it at <HI>North-We&s;t,</HI> we Steered always <HI>Ea&s;t, South-Ea&s;t,</HI> or <HI>South, South-Ea&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>About nine a Clock in the morning we had a pretty brisk Gale from <HI>North-We&s;t,</HI> which made us &s;pread our Mizan and Mizan-Top-Sail, the Main and Main-Top-Sail, and the Fore-Sail, and Fore-Top-Sail; and then we &s;teered away <HI>South, South-We&s;t,</HI> making the more way as the Wind grew fre&s;her: the water is very broad at this place. About half an hour after three a Clock in the Afternoon, we came to an Anchor near the Mouth of the River, becau&s;e our Men would not venture out to Sea in the night-time, for fear of being &s;tranded; for in the mouth of this River, there is but two Fathom water when the Tide is out; and the other Ships did as we did: the Wind in the mean time cea&s;ed about midnight.</P>
<P>Next day, we weighed Anchor about half an hour after &s;ix in the Morning, and having &s;pread the Fore-Top-Sail, we Steered away <HI>South, South-Ea&s;t,</HI> but &s;eeing it was little better than a calm, we made but very little way: neverthele&s;s we be|gan to lo&s;e &s;ight of Land on all hands, and had betwixt five and &s;ix Fathom water. About nine a Clock, we came to an Anchor to &s;tay for the Tide, becau&s;e then we had but little water: about eleven a Clock, it being flood, we weighed, and a <HI>North-We&s;t</HI> Wind ri&s;ing at the &s;ame time, we clapt on all our Sails, Steering our Cour&s;e &s;ometimes <HI>South-Ea&s;t,</HI> &s;ometimes <HI>South,</HI> and &s;ometimes <HI>South-We&s;t,</HI> ac|cording to the water we found, which was &s;ometimes but three, and &s;ometimes four Fathom. Half an hour after one of the Clock, we had four Fathom and a half water; and at two a Clock five: but at the &s;ame time the Wind chopping about to <HI>South,</HI> we were forced to furl our Sails, and come to an Anchor. It is very dangerous putting out of that River after the fir&s;t days of <HI>November,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The &s;ea&s;on of Sailing.</NOTE> for com|monly the <HI>South</HI> Winds begin to blow at that time, and la&s;t all <HI>November,</HI> whereby many Ships that put out too late, are ca&s;t away.</P>
<P><HI>Thur&s;day</HI> the twelfth of <HI>November,</HI> the Sun ro&s;e with a &s;tiff Wind from <HI>South,</HI> and at the &s;ame time the Sky was on all hands over-ca&s;t with &s;uch a thick Fog, that we could hardly &s;ee the other Ships, which yet weighed Anchor and were Towed by their Boats: we did the &s;ame, though it was again&s;t the Captains mind, who feared a &s;torm, and would have kept &s;till at Anchor. We got our Boat then to Tow us, the Ships Head &s;tanding <HI>Ea&s;t, South-Ea&s;t,</HI> in five Fathom water. About half an hour after eight we unfurled the Fore-Top-Sail, and &s;tood away <HI>Ea&s;t, North-Ea&s;t,</HI> and a little after, <HI>North, North-Ea&s;t.</HI> About nine a Clock, we &s;pread the Mizan-Sail, whil&s;t our Boat &s;till Towed us. About half an hour after nine, the Wind &s;hifting about to <HI>Ea&s;t,</HI> we pre&s;ently furled our Sails, and turning our Ships Head <HI>South-Ea&s;t,</HI> came to an Anchor a quarter of an hour after, in three Fathom water. That day they began to allow every one but two mea&s;ures of water by day; one to boil the Kettle, and the other to drink; (each mea&s;ure is about three Pints.) About a quarter after ten a Clock, we weighed Anchor, and were Towed by our Boat, &s;preading our Mizan; Main-Top-Sail, and Fore-Top-Sail, though we had no &s;ettled Wind, but &s;ometimes one way and &s;ometimes another, and we turned the Ships Head <HI>North-Ea&s;t.</HI> A little after, the Wind getting in to <HI>South-Ea&s;t,</HI> we bore away <HI>Ea&s;t,</HI> and pre&s;ently it &s;hifted to <HI>South;</HI> &s;o that three quarters after ten, we came to an Anchor.</P>
<P><PB N="170" REF="256"><HI>Friday</HI> the thirteenth of <HI>November,</HI> the Pilot of <HI>Carek</HI> and the Merchants prevailed &s;o far with the Captain, that he gave way to the weighing of Anchor at three quarters of an hour after &s;even, though he was of a contrary Opinion; and the truth is, there was no rea&s;on to weigh, becau&s;e it blew a &s;trong Wind from <HI>South-Ea&s;t,</HI> and we had but little water on all hands. We had indeed four Fathom at that time, but &s;eeing it was a Tide of Ebb, we had rea&s;on to fear running a ground; and to put out to Sea, which was the thing the Merchants de&s;ired, was to run into the &s;torm. In fine, notwith&s;tanding all the&s;e Rea&s;ons, our men Towed us, and we &s;pread the Fore-Top-Sail, but we held no certain Cour&s;e: the other Ships did as we did, and perceiving us to ca&s;t Anchor, three quarters of an hour after, they did the like. This is the inconvenience where many Ships are together, that if one weigh or come to an Anchor, the re&s;t mu&s;t do the &s;ame; for if they &s;hould fail to do it, and any misfortune happened, the blame would be laid at the Ma&s;ters door, in that he did not do as the re&s;t did, who are all &s;uppo&s;ed to under|&s;tand their Trade.</P>
<P><HI>Saturday</HI> morning the fourteenth of <HI>November,</HI> we made a <HI>Mahometan</HI> Ship coming from <HI>Ba&s;&s;ora,</HI> where we had left her; for all the &s;trong <HI>South-Ea&s;t</HI> Wind, which had con&s;tantly blown &s;ince the day before, we weighed Anchor at nine of the Clock in the morning, and made Sail with our Mizan, Main-Top, and Fore-Top-Sails, Steering our Cour&s;e <HI>Ea&s;t, North-Ea&s;t.</HI> Half an hour after nine, the Wind getting about to <HI>South-We&s;t,</HI> we let fly the Mizan Top-Sail and Fore-Sail, and &s;tood away <HI>Ea&s;t, South-Ea&s;t.</HI> At ten a Clock we tackt about, and bore away <HI>We&s;t, North-We&s;t,</HI> and &s;o kept beating to and again every half hour, until three quarters of an hour after eleven, that the Wind chopping in to <HI>South,</HI> we came to an Anchor in three Fathom water; we made &s;hort Tacks becau&s;e of the little water we had in all places, not finding above three or four Fathom at mo&s;t. The Wind continued in that corner all day, blowing fre&s;her and fre&s;her &s;till, and in the evening though the Wind was high, yet the Clouds raked contrary to it from <HI>North-We&s;t</HI> to <HI>South-Ea&s;t;</HI> from eight till ten a Clock at night, we had &s;everal &s;mall &s;howers of Rain, at length after midnight, the Wind changed into the &s;o much de&s;ired <HI>North-We&s;t</HI> Wind, and blew very hard.</P>
<P><HI>Sunday</HI> the fifteenth of <HI>November,</HI> the other Ships made Sail about break of day, and we lay &s;till at Anchor, which extremely vexed the Merchants, who thereupon came to words with the Captain; but he told them that the other Ships, were bound for <HI>Congo,</HI> and that his mu&s;t put into the I&s;le <HI>Carek</HI> which was near, &s;o that it would be time enough to weigh at noon, that we might not run in, too near the Land, in danger to be ca&s;t away by &s;o high a Wind; neverthele&s;s to plea&s;e them he commanded to weigh about &s;even a Clock in the morning, but he made Sail only with Fore-Sail, Fore-Top-Sail, and Sprit-Sail; we Steered our Cour&s;e <HI>South-Ea&s;t,</HI> and the Ship run about four Miles and a half an hour. About &s;ix a Clock at night, we &s;tood away <HI>Ea&s;t,</HI> and about &s;even a Clock, <HI>North-Ea&s;t,</HI> and then furled all our Sails, except the Sprit-Sail, and Fore-Top-Sail; having then fifteen Fathom water. About ten a Clock, we furled all our Sails, but the Sprit-Sail.</P>
<P><HI>Monday</HI> the &s;ixth of <HI>November,</HI> the Wind cea&s;ed about two a Clock in the morning, and began to blow again about &s;ix, but not &s;o &s;trong as the day before: that we might not lo&s;e it, about half an hour after, we &s;pread all our Sails, and Steered away <HI>South-Ea&s;t.</HI> It was not long before we made the main Land of <HI>Ben|der-Regh</HI> to the Larboard. About half an hour after nine we made the I&s;le <HI>Carek</HI> on Head,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cargou.</NOTE> and about noon we Sailed near to the I&s;le <HI>Cargou,</HI> which was to our Larboard. This I&s;le reaches in length from <HI>North</HI> to <HI>South;</HI> it is but &s;mall and all of white Sand, which is the rea&s;on it is not inhabited; it is clo&s;e by, and almo&s;t over again&s;t the I&s;le <HI>Carek;</HI> but a little lower, towards <HI>Bender Regh.</HI> Then we furled our Mizan and Main-Sail, and Steered away <HI>South.</HI> At one of the Clock, we found thirteen Fathom water. About half an hour after, we began to have the I&s;le <HI>Carek</HI> on our Starboard, and bore away <HI>South, South-Ea&s;t,</HI> having then &s;ix Fathom water. Half an hour after two, we had eight Fathom water, and turned the Ships Head Head <HI>South-We&s;t.</HI> Three quarters after two, we came to an Anchor to the <HI>Ea&s;t</HI> of the I&s;land, towards the point of it that looks to the <HI>South-Ea&s;t,</HI> in ten Fathom water. There we found one of the three Ships that had left us at Anchor, having &s;ome Goods to unload, but the other two kept out at Sea.</P>

Near to that I&s;le, they Fi&s;h for Pearl,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Pearl-Fi&s;hing.</NOTE> at the &s;ame time, they do at <HI>Bahrem;</HI> and I was told that during the &s;ea&s;on of Fi&s;hing, which is in <HI>May, June, July,</HI> and <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> there are to be &s;een about this I&s;land above an hundred <HI>Taranquins</HI> or Fi&s;her-Boats. The King of <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> is Lord of it, and has a Governour there, who depends on the Governour of <HI>Bender Regh.</HI> The people of this I&s;land are all Fi&s;hermen, and live only on Salt Fi&s;h and Dates. The Ships that are bound for <HI>Ba&s;&s;ora,</HI> commonly touch at this place to take in a Pilot who conducts them to <HI>Ba&s;&s;ora,</HI> and brings them back again at four months end to the &s;ame I&s;land, where they leave him. There we left ours,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Arrival at the I&s;le of <HI>Carek.</HI></NOTE> who had been taken in four months before. But it was not only to &s;et him a &s;hoar that we touched at that I&s;land; our chief bu&s;ine&s;s was to unload Goods belonging to <HI>Codgia|minas,</HI> which were Indigo, Cloaths, and other <HI>Indian</HI> Commodities, brought in the &s;ame Ship, and which not being di&s;po&s;ed of at <HI>Ba&s;&s;ora,</HI> through the bad Conduct of the <HI>Vikil,</HI> he was nece&s;&s;itated to reimbark, and &s;end them to <HI>Carek</HI> to be con|veyed from thence to <HI>Bender-Regh,</HI> and &s;o to <HI>I&s;pahan.</HI> Be&s;ides, they made account to take on Board &s;everal <HI>Armenian</HI> Merchants and their mony, who waited on this I&s;land for a pa&s;&s;age to the <HI>Indies:</HI> for within the&s;e late years, the <HI>Armenians</HI> that they may not pay Cu&s;tom at <HI>Congo</HI> have taken the Cour&s;e to go &s;treight from <HI>Schiras</HI> to <HI>Bender-Regh,</HI> where there is no Cu&s;tom-Hou&s;e, and from thence pa&s;s over to <HI>Carek,</HI> where they wait for the opportunity of &s;ome Ships coming that way, which may carry them and their mony. However the <HI>Mou&s;on</HI> before, &s;ome <HI>Armenians</HI> upon their return from the <HI>Indies,</HI> having put a &s;hoar at <HI>Bender-Regh</HI> to avoid the Cu&s;toms of <HI>Congo,</HI> the Cu&s;tomer went to Law with them about it at <HI>I&s;pahan,</HI> pre|tending that they ought to pay him the Cu&s;tom, and it was thought that it would co&s;t them at lea&s;t a good part of the mony, which they mu&s;t have paid at <HI>Congo,</HI> and that for the future there would be a Cu&s;tom-Hou&s;e e&s;tabli&s;hed at <HI>Bender-Regh.</HI> The Ships that touch at <HI>Carek,</HI> keep out at Sea to the <HI>We&s;tward</HI> of it, to &s;hun the danger of being ca&s;t away in that narrow &s;treight which is betwixt <HI>Carek</HI> and <HI>Cargou.</HI></P>
<P>As &s;oon as we were come to an Anchor, five or &s;ix &s;mall <HI>Taranquins,</HI> (which are tho&s;e &s;owed Boats I de&s;cribed before,) came a Board of us to take in all the Goods that were for <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> which la&s;ted from five, till half an hour after &s;even a Clock at night. Our Company were much deceived as to the <HI>Armenian</HI> Merchants, for contrary to their expectation, they found not one: which was occa&s;ioned by a trick of a <HI>Dutchman,</HI> Captain of the Ship called the <HI>Ma&s;ulipatan,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The trick of a <HI>Dutch</HI> man.</NOTE> who had given them a ca&s;t of his Trade. This Ship being gone from <HI>Ba&s;&s;ora</HI> a day before we put out, was come to <HI>Carek</HI> two days &s;ooner than we did; the Captain making u&s;e of the occa&s;ion, failed not to tell the Merchants who waited for our Ship, that &s;he would not come this year, which they believed to be true, and went aboard with their mony on his Ship. All this proceeded from the fault of the <HI>Vikil,</HI> that &s;tayed be|hind at <HI>Ba&s;&s;ora,</HI> who detained the Ship in the Harbour a Fortnight longer than he &s;hould have done, to get on Board &s;ome Goods which payed not above an hundred Pia&s;tres Freight; and in the mean while he lo&s;t the Freight of a great deal of Goods and Mony, and of many Pa&s;&s;engers that were at <HI>Carek, Congo,</HI> and <HI>Comoron</HI> who embarked in the Ships which touched at the&s;e Ports before us.</P>
<P>When we had put a &s;hoar all the Goods, and the Man who was to take care of them; we weighed Anchor three quarters of an hour after &s;even, making all the Sail we could, and Steering away <HI>South, South-Ea&s;t,</HI> with a very ea&s;ie Wind; about ten a Clock we were becalmed till midnight, when there blew a little Gale at <HI>Ea&s;t,</HI> but as ea&s;ie as the former, and with it we bore away <HI>South.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="172" REF="257">Next day about two or three a Clock in the morning, we Sailed by the I&s;le of <HI>Ri&s;cher,</HI> which was to our Larboard. This I&s;land is very near the main Land, and makes a little Port, which is called <HI>Bender-Ri&s;cher,</HI> a days Journy from <HI>Bender-Regh;</HI> and there is a Fort on it, which belonged formerly to the <HI>Portugue&s;e.</HI> At break of day, we made two Ships on Head of us, one of which had put out from <HI>Carek</HI> five days before us. Half an hour after &s;even, we were off of the I&s;le of <HI>Coucher,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Coucher.</NOTE> that was to our Larboard; and is a pretty big I&s;land. At eight a Clock we got a Head of one of the Ships that had been before us: the other which was at &s;ome di&s;tance, put us into &s;ome apprehen&s;ion for a few hours time; for by his manner of working, he gave us cau&s;e to think that he had a mind to be up with us; and we were affraid he might be a <HI>Cor&s;air;</HI> but at length, he Steered the &s;ame Cour&s;e that we did. About ten a Clock we were becalmed. Three quarters after twelve, the Wind being <HI>Southerly,</HI> we Steered away <HI>Ea&s;t.</HI> A quarter after two, we Steered <HI>South-Ea&s;t.</HI> Three quarters after three a Clock, the Wind chopping about to <HI>South-We&s;t,</HI> we &s;tood away <HI>South, South-Ea&s;t.</HI> And thus the Wind being but very ea&s;ie, did nothing but chop and change until the evening that we were becalmed.</P>
<P><HI>Wedne&s;day</HI> the eighteenth of <HI>November</HI> towards day, having an ea&s;ie Gale from <HI>Ea&s;t, South-Ea&s;t,</HI> we Steered our Cour&s;e <HI>South, South-We&s;t:</HI> about half an hour after nine, it blowing hard from <HI>South,</HI> we bore away <HI>We&s;t, South-We&s;t.</HI> About three quarters of an hour after ten, the Wind turned <HI>South, South-Ea&s;t,</HI> and we Steered <HI>Ea&s;t.</HI> Half an hour after noon, the Wind &s;lackened much, and about five a Clock in the evening we were becalmed. About half an hour after nine, we made a Sail to the Windward of us, and another on Head, but a great way before us; we ca&s;t the Lead and found &s;eventeen Fathom water. At ten a Clock at night, the Wind turned <HI>Ea&s;t, South-Ea&s;t,</HI> and blew pretty hard, and we Steered away <HI>South, South-We&s;t;</HI> finding only thirteen Fathom water, when we heaved the Lead.</P>
<P>After midnight, we pa&s;t Cape <HI>Verde&s;tan,</HI> which was to our Larboard. This is a very dangerous Cape, and one night &s;everal <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> Ships being Land-lockt there, (when they thought them&s;elves far enough off of it,) were ca&s;t away. We Sailed within three or four Leagues of it, and when it was day &s;aw it a Stern of us. About half an hour after nine, the Wind turned <HI>South, South-Ea&s;t,</HI> and we Steered <HI>Ea&s;t.</HI> About noon we &s;aw &s;everal <HI>Taranquins.</HI> Half an hour after one, the Wind turned <HI>South, South-We&s;t,</HI> and we bore away <HI>South-Ea&s;t.</HI> We were then off and on Cape <HI>Naban</HI> to our Larboard,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cape <HI>Naban.</HI></NOTE> and made it but very dimly; but coming up more and more towards it, we made it very plain, and &s;aw along the Sea-&s;ide, Rocky Hills, which &s;eemed to be very &s;teep, and at the foot of them, a great many Palm-Trees. We continued our Cour&s;e off and on with the&s;e Rocks, till five a Clock that we &s;aw the end of them; at lea&s;t in this place they run far up into the Land, and leave a very level Coa&s;t: in this low Country is the Village called <HI>Naban,</HI> which gives the name to the Cape. Here we ca&s;t the Lead, and found only &s;even Fathom water: there is but little water all along that Coa&s;t, and there|fore we pre&s;ently tackt and &s;tood off to the <HI>We&s;t,</HI> about ten a Clock at night the Wind turned <HI>North-Ea&s;t,</HI> and we Steered away <HI>South, South-Ea&s;t.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Friday</HI> the twentieth of <HI>November,</HI> by break of day, we made the three Ships, that put out the &s;ame day with us from <HI>Ba&s;&s;ora,</HI> two of which were at a pretty good di&s;tance to the Starboard, and the other very near a Head of us, it was this la&s;t which &s;ome days before, we had taken for a <HI>Cor&s;air:</HI> we made al&s;o to our Larboard the Land of <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> but at a great di&s;tance. A quarter after nine a Clock in the morning, having a very ea&s;ie Gale from <HI>North, North-We&s;t,</HI> we put out our Main and Fore-Top-Galant-Sail, and kept on our Cour&s;e <HI>South, South-Ea&s;t:</HI> in a &s;hort time we left all the other Ships a Stern. About noon the Wind blew much fre&s;her; and about three a Clock, we &s;tood away <HI>Ea&s;t, South-Ea&s;t:</HI> about five a Clock, we took in our Top-Galant-Sails, the Mizan, and Mizan-Top-Sails, becau&s;e it would have been dangerous to have made &s;o much way in the night-time that was now coming on, for we might have run within Land, con&s;idering that the Wind fre&s;hened more and more, and we bore away <HI>South, South-Ea&s;t,</HI> that we might keep without the I&s;le of <HI>Lara.</HI> If it had been day, we would have Steered our Cour&s;e betwixt the main Land and that I&s;land, but we dur&s;t not venture it in the night-time, being &s;afer to leave it to the Larboard: we made account to have
<PB N="173" REF="257">
Sailed by that I&s;land about midnight, but we &s;aw it not, though we had all along light enough, to di&s;cern a little of the main Land near to which it lyes.</P>
<P>We concluded then, that we had pa&s;t that I&s;le of <HI>Lara</HI> in the night-time, but next day we found that we were out in our reckoning. Neverthele&s;s, &s;eeing we did not find out our mi&s;take till after noon; about &s;ix a Clock in the morning, we Steered away <HI>Ea&s;t,</HI> bearing in towards the Land, for fear we might be ca&s;t too far to the Leeward of <HI>Congo.</HI> About half an hour after &s;ix our Long-Boat that was fa&s;tened to the Stern filled full of water, and &s;unk under the &s;urface of the Sea: we pre&s;ently furled all Sails but the Sprit-Sail, and three Seamen &s;wam to the Boat to fa&s;ten another Rope to it which they held by the end; then they went into it, and we halled it to the Leeward &s;ide of the Ship, and took out a little Anchor that was in her; this being done our men attempted to hall her out of the water by one &s;ide, that &s;he might be emptied by the other; but the weight of the water bulged one of her &s;ides, and then &s;he over&s;et; &s;o that de&s;pairing to recover her, unle&s;s with much labour and the lo&s;s of a great deal of time, and fearing be&s;ides that &s;he might da&s;h again&s;t the Hold of the Ship, becau&s;e it was then a very rough Sea, they cut the Ropes and let her go, though it was near a hundred <HI>Pia&s;tres</HI> lo&s;s to the Owner of the Ship, This made us lo&s;e a whole hours time, and in the mean while one of the Ships (which the day before was to our Starboard,) got a Head of us. About half an hour after &s;even in the morning, we made Sail with a <HI>North</HI> Wind. About half an hour after nine, we were off of an I&s;land to our Larboard, which we took to be <HI>Audarvia,</HI> but we were mi&s;taken. About ten a Clock the violence of the Wind began to abate, and we Steered away <HI>Ea&s;t, South-Ea&s;t.</HI> About two a Clock after-noon, we made a little I&s;land to the Lar|board very near the main Land, and knew it be <HI>Audarvia,</HI> and that the other which we pa&s;t about half an hour after nine in the morning, and took for <HI>Au|darvia,</HI> was <HI>Lara.</HI> This I&s;le of <HI>Lara</HI> is a little De&s;art very low place,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lara.</NOTE> clo&s;e by the main Land, which is the rea&s;on that it is not ea&s;ily di&s;covered: it bears nothing unle&s;s it be &s;ome wild Trees, and that too only at one end of it, which lyes to the <HI>We&s;t, North-We&s;t,</HI> and was to us the beginning of the I&s;le, as our Cour&s;e lay; it may be known by the&s;e Trees. It lyes in length from <HI>We&s;t, North-We&s;t,</HI> to <HI>Ea&s;t, South-Ea&s;t;</HI> and is three&s;core and ten Leagues from <HI>Carek.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Audarvia.</NOTE> The I&s;le of <HI>Audarvia</HI> is in like manner little, low, and very near the main Land, and lyes in length as <HI>Lara</HI> does from <HI>We&s;t, North-We&s;t,</HI> to <HI>Ea&s;t, South-Ea&s;t:</HI> there is good water in this I&s;land, and in the middle of it &s;ome wild Trees, and the Cottages of &s;ome Fi&s;hermen, who come from the main Land to Fi&s;h there; it being &s;even or eight Leagues from <HI>Lara.</HI> It is worth the ob&s;erving that though the&s;e two I&s;les be very near the Land, (as I have been &s;aying,) yet they leave a pa&s;&s;age betwixt them and the main Land, which may admit of Ships, becau&s;e it is very deep water, and Ships &s;ometimes &s;hoot that pa&s;&s;age. The Wind fre&s;hning in the afternoon, at three quarters of an hour after two a Clock, we were got to the farther end of the I&s;land, and an hour after, made the I&s;le of <HI>Keis</HI> to the <HI>South-Ea&s;t.</HI> About half an hour after four, we got on Head of the Ship that was before us in the morning, and at the &s;ame time we were off and on with the hithermo&s;t end of the I&s;le of <HI>Keis,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Keis.</NOTE> which was to our Starboard &s;ide. This I&s;land is about two Leagues and a half from the main Land, or three at mo&s;t, and about five Leagues from <HI>Audarvia,</HI> though they reckon it fifteen Leagues from <HI>Lara</HI> to <HI>Keis:</HI> it reaches in length from <HI>We&s;t, South-We&s;t,</HI> to <HI>Ea&s;t, North-Ea&s;t,</HI> and is about five Leagues in Circuit; it is very low and flat like the two former, but it is inhabited by &s;everal people, who have Hou&s;es di&s;per&s;ed here and there upon it.</P>
<P>I was told that heretofore the Inhabitants of that I&s;land, having killed a <HI>Por|tugue&s;e</HI> who had gone a &s;hoar there, for &s;ome in&s;olence which he had commit|ted; &s;ometime after, other <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> Ships coming thither, the Admiral called <HI>Roui-Fereyra-Andrada,</HI> went a &s;hoar upon the I&s;land, and taking a Sucking-Child, put it into a Mortar; and by an unparalelled piece of cruelty,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A horrid piece of cru|elty of a <HI>Por|tugue&s;e.</HI></NOTE> made the Father and Mother of the innocent Babe pound it them&s;elves in the Mortar.

I was told that heretofore there were all &s;orts of Fruits on this I&s;land, but that &s;ince the <HI>Por|tugue&s;e</HI> have left off to go thither, there are no more to be found: I was likewi&s;e a&s;&s;ured that there is excellent water in the <HI>North-We&s;t,</HI> and <HI>Ea&s;t</HI> ends of the I&s;le.</P>
<P>About five a Clock in the evening, we furled our Mizan, Mizan-Top, Main-Top, and Fore-Top-Sails, that we might not make &s;o much way, becau&s;e on this Coa&s;t there are places where the water is very &s;hallow. About &s;even a Clock at night, we were got off of the other end of the I&s;le of <HI>Keis,</HI> and then the Wind &s;lackened much, half an hour after, we came off and on a place of the main Land, where the &s;hoar opens towards the <HI>Ea&s;t,</HI> and forms a Gulf in &s;hape of a half Circle, and the outmo&s;t point of that half Circle is called <HI>Gherd.</HI> All that day we had kept very near the main Land, which to that Gulf bears <HI>We&s;t, North-We&s;t,</HI> and <HI>Ea&s;t, South-Ea&s;t.</HI> When we were ju&s;t off the beginning of this Gulf, a gentle Gale blowing from <HI>Ea&s;t, North-Ea&s;t,</HI> made us to Steer our Cour&s;e <HI>South-Ea&s;t,</HI> and we made the Land called <HI>Gherd,</HI> to the <HI>Ea&s;t, South Ea&s;t.</HI> About ten a Clock at night, we &s;tood away <HI>South, South-Ea&s;t,</HI> and heaving out the Lead, found &s;eventeen Fathom water: within a quarter of an hour after, the Wind turning <HI>North-We&s;t,</HI> we bore away <HI>South,</HI> but becau&s;e it in&s;tantly blew too hard, we furled the Main-Sail, and Steered <HI>South, South-Ea&s;t.</HI> About three quarters after ten, we Steered <HI>South-Ea&s;t,</HI> and ca&s;ting the Lead, found fifteen Fathom water.</P>

Three quarters after two, we bore away <HI>Ea&s;t, South-Ea&s;t,</HI> and ca&s;ting the Lead, found fir&s;t fifteen, then ten, and a little farther only eight Fathom water; we had then to the Larboard a Mountain on the main Land,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mount <HI>Sannas.</HI></NOTE> called <HI>Sannas.</HI> Half an hour after five in the morning, we had but five Fathom water.

This Town lyes in length from <HI>We&s;t, North-We&s;t,</HI> to <HI>Ea&s;t, South-Ea&s;t;</HI> it is but very &s;mall, and has a little Ca&s;tle defended by three pieces of Cannon. It has a &s;afe Road for Ships, though they be often to&s;&s;ed by high Winds, whil&s;t we were there, it blew &s;o &s;trong an <HI>Ea&s;t</HI> Wind for four days time, that no Boat could come or go a &s;hoar, and all the Ships that were at Anchor drove except ours, though they had two Anchors a piece a broad; but they being &s;mall Anchors, took no &s;trong hold in the ground, but ea&s;ily came home: we rode it out very well with a great Anchor, and all that we were affraid of, was lea&s;t the other Ships that drove might run foul of us; as indeed it happened one night, when the Wind having broken the Cables, and forced a <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Ship from two Anchors, if &s;he had not had a third, (which they &s;peedily let fall,) &s;he would have put us in danger; for &s;he was ju&s;t upon our Head; neverthele&s;s, I never heard of any Ship ca&s;t away in that Road.

<P>Being at <HI>Congo,</HI> I had thoughts of leaving the Ship <HI>Hopewel,</HI> and to take the opportunity of a Bark for the <HI>Sindy,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Sindy.</NOTE> which is the hither part of the <HI>Indies,</HI> and the place where the River of <HI>Indus</HI> di&s;charges it &s;elf into the Sea. I had two rea&s;ons to incline me to this; the fir&s;t, that I might the more regularly make the Tour of the <HI>Indies,</HI> and be&s;ides I was willing to learn at a di&s;tance news of &s;ome <HI>Hollanders</HI> my enemies, who were at <HI>Surrat,</HI> before I came too near them. Since I had the &s;ame de&s;ign at <HI>Ba&s;&s;ora,</HI> where there were two good Barks, each mounted with &s;ix Bra&s;s Guns, ready to &s;et Sail for the <HI>Sindy,</HI> I was re&s;olved to have taken pa&s;&s;age in one of them, and for that end had &s;poken to the <HI>Reis</HI> who was a <HI>Turk</HI> of <HI>Ba&s;&s;ora:</HI> but the War of the <HI>Ba&s;ha</HI> &s;upervening, he cau&s;ed tho&s;e Barks to be unloaded of their Goods, and loaded with Corn for the Ca&s;tle of <HI>Corna,</HI> where he de&s;igned to maintain the brunt of the War; and be&s;ides he made account, (in ca&s;e he &s;hould be overcome,) to put on Board tho&s;e two Barks, the be&s;t of his Goods, and make his e&s;cape with them, not into <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> (where the la&s;t time he had taken refuge there, they would have Arre&s;ted him,) but to the <HI>Indies.</HI> In the mean time, that unexpected War broke all my Mea&s;ures, and left me none other to take for the &s;ame de&s;ign; becau&s;e there was not a Ship at <HI>Ba&s;&s;ora</HI> bound for that Voyage; and that a little before, hoping to have a pa&s;&s;age in one of the&s;e two Barks, I had let &s;lip the occa&s;ion of a Galliot going to <HI>Congo,</HI> where &s;he expected to take in mony, and then continue her Cour&s;e to <HI>Sindy;</HI> finding my &s;elf fru&s;trate of my expectation, I was obliged to take Shipping in the <HI>Hopewel,</HI> that being come to <HI>Congo</HI> I might take the occa&s;ion of a Bark for <HI>Sindy;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">In the begin|ning of <HI>De|cember</HI> they put out from <HI>Congo</HI> for the <HI>Indies.</HI></NOTE> for every year in the beginning of <HI>December</HI> &s;everal &s;mall Barks Sail from <HI>Congo</HI> to <HI>Sindy;</HI> but we found none there but the Galliot which &s;et out from <HI>Ba&s;&s;ora,</HI> there being no other to make the Voyage this year. I made enquiry whether or not it was &s;afe to go in that Galliot, and was informed that no body would venture any thing on Board of her, for fear of the <HI>Zinganes,</HI> who are <HI>Indians</HI> Neighbouring upon the <HI>Sindy,</HI> that rob mo&s;t part of the Barks that put in or out of it.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Zinganes,</HI> Rob|bers.</NOTE> The King of <HI>Mogul</HI> &s;ends them Pre&s;ents every year, though they be his Subjects, to oblige them to leave off their Piracy; but being Rebel Subjects, they take his Pre&s;ents, but &s;till con|tinue their Robberies.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Zinganes</HI> way of Rob|bing.</NOTE>The&s;e <HI>Zinganes</HI> have a pretty odd way of taking Prizes; they keep with their Barks upon the Bar of the <HI>Sindy,</HI> and when they &s;ee any Merchant Bark coming, they get to the Windward of him, and being come up pretty near before they lay him on Board, they throw into the Bark a great many Pots full of Lime reduced into a very &s;mall Powder; the Wind driving this du&s;t again&s;t the Men that are on Board, blinds them, and renders them unable to make defence. In the mean time, they Board and leap into the Bark, putting every living &s;oul to the Sword, (for they have no other Arms but Swords and Arrows:) and if any have a mind to &s;ave their lives, there is no other way for it, but to jump into the Sea, and &s;o avoid their fury until they be wholely Ma&s;ters of the Ve&s;&s;el; for till then, they give no Quarter: but when they find them&s;elves &s;ure of their Prize, they &s;hed no more blood, and make Pri&s;oners of all that remain alive; to hinder who&s;e e&s;caping, they cut the great Tendon that is above the Heel in each Leg, which renders them for ever unable to run away; and indeed, it is not po&s;&s;ible for a Man who has the&s;e Nerves cut, to go. Then they carry them to their Habitations, and &s;et them to keep their Flocks, without any hopes whil&s;t they live of being delivered from that Bondage which is wor&s;e than death it &s;elf. Having informed my &s;elf then, of that Galliot, I learnt that &s;he was not only in danger of being taken by the <HI>Zinganes,</HI> but al&s;o that the Men who were on Board of her, and were all <HI>Banians,</HI> were re&s;olved to make no Defence, but to let them&s;elves, (according to their Cu&s;tom,) be taken like &s;o many Calves: be&s;ides &s;hould the&s;e Men have been Friends of the <HI>Zinganes,</HI> I had rea&s;on to fear that they might &s;ell me to the&s;e Pirats, or to the <HI>Arabs</HI> of <HI>Ma&s;cate:</HI> &s;o that finding my &s;elf every way in danger of lo&s;ing my Liberty or Life, and not permitted to defend my &s;elf; I re&s;olved to continue in the <HI>Hopewel,</HI> and to proceed to <HI>Surrat,</HI> laying a&s;ide all thoughts of the Gal|liot, which &s;et out from <HI>Congo, Thur&s;day</HI> the thirteenth of <HI>December.</HI> I have ob&s;erved the&s;e things, becau&s;e I think the knowledge of them may be u&s;eful

to tho&s;e who are bound for the <HI>Sindy,</HI> to the end they may take their Mea&s;ures accordingly.</P>
<P>We lay &s;ixteen days before <HI>Congo,</HI> and I kept on Board all the while, not think|ing it convenient to go a &s;hoar, becau&s;e of the King of <HI>Portugals</HI> Agent, with whom I had had a little cla&s;hing at <HI>Schiras.</HI> This Man was powerful at <HI>Congo;</HI> neverthele&s;s he dayly invited me to come a &s;hoar, and &s;pend &s;ome days merrily at his Hou&s;e, and complained to all our Men that I would not: to this I made an|&s;wer, that I was re&s;olved not to &s;et a Foot a &s;hoar, until I could walk upon <HI>In|dian</HI> ground. And (the truth is,) when I reflected upon what befel me at <HI>Co|moron,</HI> I lookt upon it as a Tre&s;pa&s;s again&s;t human prudence, to run the hazard a &s;econd time of being hindered to go into the <HI>Indies.</HI> So that all the <HI>Armenians</HI> being a &s;hoar, and our <HI>Franks</HI> going thither a days, and never returning till night, I was many times the only White Man that remained on Board with the Blacks,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Blacks and Whites.</NOTE> for &s;o they call the <HI>Indians;</HI> and in the <HI>Indies</HI> they put as great a difference betwixt a White and a Black, as betwixt a Ma&s;ter and a Slave; the Sons of <HI>Europeans,</HI> born in the <HI>Indies</HI> are called <HI>Meti&s;&s;es;</HI> they are not &s;o de&s;picable as the real <HI>Indians,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Meti&s;&s;es.</NOTE> (that is to &s;ay,) tho&s;e who&s;e Father and Mother are both <HI>Indians;</HI> but after all, the <HI>Europeans</HI> look upon them &s;till, as people infinitely below them&s;elves.</P>
<P>In the mean time it was very ill ordered that the Ship &s;hould be &s;o abandoned, for a Captain is, (as it were,) the Ma&s;ter of a Family, he ought never to lye out of his Ship, or if he does, he ought at lea&s;t to leave &s;ome body in his place, to give Orders when any accident happens, as very often there does; and indeed, we were like to have been ruined on <HI>Monday</HI> morning the thirtieth of <HI>November,</HI> when one of our <HI>Italians</HI> having lighted a Pipe of Tobacco aloft upon the Deck, before the Ma&s;ters Cabin, he laid down his Match upon the Binnicle, &s;o near the hole of the Whip&s;taff, that it fell down through that hole into the Gun-Room, at the foot of the Mizan-Ma&s;t, upon which many Horns full of powder hung, and where there were &s;everal Bandaliers, and Cartaradges ready filled with powder for the Guns. By good fortune my man went down at the &s;ame time; and being in the Gun-Room &s;melt fire, which made him look about on all Hands, until he found the lighted Match, which he &s;natched up, and in great fear brought it above Decks, and in all probability if he had not gone down at the very nick of time, the Ship could not have failed of being very quickly blown up. But God of his infinite mercy delivered us.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t we lay at Anchor before <HI>Congo,</HI> we put a &s;hoar two Hor&s;es for <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> and took on Board four others belonging to the <HI>Sieur Manuel Mendez Henriquez</HI> Agent of the King of <HI>Portugal,</HI> who left his Re&s;idence at <HI>Congo,</HI> upon di&s;content, becau&s;e the Cu&s;tomer would not pay him all that belonged to the King of <HI>Portugal</HI> of the profits of the Cu&s;toms this year and the year before. And for that rea&s;on he was re&s;olved to go to <HI>Daman,</HI> and from thence to <HI>Goa,</HI> to complain to the Vice-Roy, de&s;igning to come back with two Galliots of War, and plunder what he could along the Coa&s;t of <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> and chiefly at <HI>Congo:</HI> which would have been ea&s;ie for him to do, even with &s;o &s;mall a Force as two Galliots. He put on Board, then two Women Slaves, and &s;even or eight Men, Servants and Slaves, with a great deal of Goods, leaving no body at <HI>Congo,</HI> but a Deputy and a Clerk, whom he charged not to &s;ee the Cu&s;tom-Hou&s;e, nor Cu&s;tomer, nor yet to receive any thing from him, until new Orders from the <HI>Indies.</HI> The Cu&s;tomer employed &s;everal to Mediate an Accommodation with <HI>Manuel Mendez,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><P><HI>Manuel Men|dez.</HI></P>

<P><HI>Ba&s;&s;ora</HI> To|bacco.</P></NOTE> but ill Language was all the an&s;wer he had. Be&s;ides all this Equipage, we took on Board &s;everal Bags of mony belonging to <HI>Armenian</HI> Merchants; &s;everal Bales of <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Carpets; &s;everal Bags of Gentian, which is Tran&s;ported from <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> where it grows, into the <HI>Indies,</HI> where it is u&s;ed for dying red, and &s;everal Bags of Tobacco; for neither the <HI>Indian</HI> nor <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Tobacco is good for any thing, and cannot be taken but with a Bottle full of water, through which the &s;moak pa&s;&s;es before it come at the Mouth; &s;o that they who carry good Tabacco to the <HI>Indies,</HI> make a great profit of it; we took on Board al&s;o &s;everal Che&s;ts of <HI>Schiras</HI> Wine; and our <HI>Franks</HI> of the Ships Company, carried &s;ome Bags of Nuts, of which they hoped to make, at lea&s;t fifty <HI>per cent;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Bags of Nuts.</NOTE> but you mu&s;t take notice that this is a Commodity proper only for tho&s;e who have not above twenty <HI>Pia&s;tres</HI> to lay out in Trading, and pay no Freight, &s;uch as the inferiour Officers or Sea-men; for every Officer and Sea-man may put on Board &s;o many Bags Freight free, according to the Office he di&s;charges in the Ship.</P>
<P><PB N="180" REF="260">Be&s;ides all the&s;e Goods, there came on Board &s;o many people with their Che&s;ts, Jarrs, and other luggage, and &s;uch a quantity of Pullets, Goats and Kids; (for in that Climate it is the be&s;t and whole&s;ome&s;t meat, the Mutton there being good for nothing,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A great clut|ter in the Ship.</NOTE>) that the Ship was thwackt full above and below Decks, and &s;o pe&s;tered, that one had much a do to &s;tir. Many more Goods were offered to be put on Board, but the Captain refu&s;ed them, having no more &s;pare room. With all this clutter and confu&s;ion, we had the vexatious humour of the Captain to &s;uffer, who was &s;o imperious and haughty,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Captain a ha&s;ty man.</NOTE> that the lea&s;t triffle offended him, and he was continually quarrelling with one or other of the three <HI>Franks</HI> who were Officers in the Ship, though they never gave him a word again: when the fancy took him in the Head, he would break out into &s;uch extravagancies of rage, that he would fall a Cur&s;ing and abu&s;ing the fir&s;t Man that &s;tood in his way; and &s;ometimes he would challenge all the Ship to fight him when he came to <HI>Surrat,</HI> adding that he was an <HI>Italian,</HI> yes that he was. He would &s;uffer no body to &s;ay any thing to him, and to hear him vapour, there was no Man greater than he: he had many debates with the <HI>Soubre&s;cart</HI> at whom he had a great Pique, as with the re&s;t of the <HI>Armenians</HI> al&s;o; &s;ometimes he was &s;o enflamed with rage, that no le&s;s would &s;erve his turn, than to go a &s;hoar and leave the Ship; but then con&s;idering on it better, he would burn her or run her again&s;t a Rock. All the <HI>Armenians</HI> were to have their Heads broken; nay more than that, he was re&s;olved to come &s;ome time or other and take all the Ships on tho&s;e Seas, and a hundred &s;uch extravagancies that blew away with the Wind: the Pilot had no ea&s;ie task of it, for he could not endure that he &s;hould give his Opinion, thinking it an indignity that any Man &s;hould &s;eem to know more than him&s;elf. When he was in all his rage no body made him an&s;wer, no more than if he had been a Mad-man, and indeed, it was commonly the <HI>Shiras</HI> Wine, or <HI>Congo</HI> Brandy, that rai&s;ed all this huff and din. When he was at a &s;tand whom to fall &s;oul on, he turned to the Merchants that came la&s;t on Board, who had their Goods in &s;ome place upon the Deck, not knowing where el&s;e to put them; he would tell them that he mu&s;t have &s;o much mony, to &s;uffer their Goods to lye in &s;uch a place, or el&s;e threaten to throw them over Board: if they told him that they had payed &s;o much to the <HI>Soubre&s;cart,</HI> and that they knew not where to lye, he &s;hewed them little Cabins, but he would have &s;o much mony for the hire of them, that no body would take them. The truth is, he was not altogether in the wrong, as to this la&s;t point, for they &s;uffer not commonly Goods to lye upon the Deck, becau&s;e they hinder the working of the Ship; and as for the Cabins, it is u&s;ual to let them at a very dear rate in <HI>Indian</HI> Ships, becau&s;e of the many Pa&s;&s;en|gers they have commonly on Board.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">An hundred and &s;ixteen &s;ouls on Board.</NOTE>We were in all an hundred and &s;ixteen on Board, of whom about four&s;core were Pa&s;&s;engers, all <HI>Armenians,</HI> except the <HI>Sieur Manuel Mendez</HI> and his Com|pany, my Man and I. A Cabin five Foot long, two Foot wide, and three Foot high, was let for a <HI>Toman</HI> and a half, during the Voyage to <HI>Surrat,</HI> and the Boat was let for four&s;core <HI>Aba&s;&s;is.</HI> It is the Cu&s;tom that &s;o &s;oon as the Ship is out at Sea the Boat is halled in, and la&s;hed to Mid&s;hips betwixt the Main-Ma&s;t and Fore-Ma&s;t.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cabins be|longing to the Captain.</NOTE> In &s;hort, all know that there are &s;ome Cabins which belong to the Captain, as al&s;o all the Deck; and tho&s;e who would accommodate them&s;elves there, mu&s;t pay for it, e&s;pecially when there is a <HI>Soubre&s;cart</HI> on the Ship, who takes the mony for the pa&s;&s;age,<NOTE PLACE="marg">What a Pa&s;|&s;enger is fur|ni&s;hed with.</NOTE> for which you are allowed no more but Salt, Water, and Wood, and the&s;e two la&s;t too are given out every day by Mea&s;ure; but you mu&s;t hire a place to lye and be in from the Captain, or &s;ome of the Officers of the Ship who have Cabins, and have no &s;hare of the mony that you pay for your pa&s;&s;age.

<P>The greate&s;t inconvenience Men endure on Board the&s;e Ships, is the want of water, for though every one has no more allowed him but two mea&s;ures a day, to drink, boil his Victuals, water his Poultry, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> each of which mea&s;ures containing three Pints or there abouts, and every Hor&s;e eight mea&s;ures; neverthele&s;s it is

<P><HI>Monday</HI> the &s;ixth of <HI>December,</HI> a <HI>We&s;t</HI> Wind coming in with the New-Moon, the Ship <HI>Ma&s;ulipatan,</HI> made Sail in the morning, without firing a Gun, and all day long &s;uch as were to go with us were coming on Board, until five a Clock in the evening, when we weighed, made Sail, and Steered away <HI>South.</HI> We were then in five Fathom water, and about half an hour after &s;ix, we found &s;ix Fa|thom.

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. III.</HI> A Continuation of the Voyage to the <HI>Indies. SPOUTS.</HI></HEAD>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Spouts.</NOTE>WHil&s;t the Tempe&s;t to&s;&s;ed our Ship with all imaginable violence, they called me to &s;ee a Spout, that was to the Larborad, near Land, and a Musket &s;hot from the Ship: it was to the Leeward of us, and la&s;ted but a little while. Turning to the other &s;ide, ju&s;t as it was &s;pent, I perceived another beginning not much above the &s;ame di&s;tance from us: it was likewi&s;e to the Leeward, for the Wind turned and changed then into all corners. Whil&s;t I ob&s;erved it, a &s;econd broke out at the &s;ide of it, and within a trice a third, by the &s;ide of the &s;econd. I pre&s;ently began to &s;ay the Go&s;pel of St. <HI>John,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Go&s;pel of St. <HI>John.</HI></NOTE> which is &s;aid at the end of Ma&s;s, that God Almighty might, for the &s;ake of that Go&s;pel, pre&s;erve us from tho&s;e Spouts; not that I thought the danger &s;o very great, being they were to the Lee|ward of us, and in reality, they wrought more admiration than fear in me. Ne|verthele&s;s there was a great con&s;ternation among&s;t our Company, all Hands were at work, and our <HI>Franks</HI> kept a heavy &s;tir, calling and asking, whether any one had the Go&s;pel of St. <HI>John;</HI> they addre&s;&s;ed them&s;elves to me, and I told them that I was a &s;aying it; and whil&s;t they prayed me to continue, one of them brought a Knife with a black handle, asking if any body knew how to cut the Spouts: I made an&s;wer that I had been informed of the way that &s;ome u&s;ed to cut them, but that I would not put it in practi&s;e, becau&s;e it was a bad and unlawful &s;uper&s;tition; he objected, that the Spouts were &s;o near, that they would quickly fall upon the Ship, and infallibly &s;ink her, and that if he knew the &s;ecret, he would do it: I endeavoured to rea&s;&s;ure him and the re&s;t from the fear which made him &s;peak &s;o, telling them that the Spouts being to the Leeward, there was not &s;o much danger as they imagined. And in &s;hort, to put that thought quite out of their Heads, I plainly told them that I neither would do that &s;uper&s;titious Art my &s;elf, nor teach any body el&s;e how to do it; and that for the Go&s;pel of St. <HI>John</HI> I &s;hould willingly per&s;i&s;t in &s;aying it, becau&s;e it was a good and lawful means to pro|cure protection from God Almighty. And indeed, I forbore not to &s;ay it, till all the Spouts were di&s;per&s;ed, which was not before one a Clock after noon or thereabouts.</P>
<P>They had put us all into a very great fright; nay the &s;hips Company who had &s;pent mo&s;t of their life-time at Sea, confe&s;&s;ed that they had never &s;een any &s;o near them, and the Gunner who was a Native of <HI>Toulon</HI> a&s;&s;ured us that in the &s;pace of eight and thirty years, he had never &s;een any &s;o near, nor that had put him into &s;o great a fright, and he failed not to &s;et down in his Journal, that that day, God had pre&s;erved him when he was in great danger of having been ca&s;t away. Having, (during this hurry and confu&s;ion,) ca&s;t out the Lead, we found one and twenty Fathom water; which made the Captain re&s;olve to come to an Anchor, and accordingly ordered it to be done: but whil&s;t afterwards, he went to ano|ther place; to give &s;ome other Orders, the Mate, who was of a contrary Opinion, told the Boat&s;wain that he &s;hould not do it, and he was very willingly obeyed; becau&s;e then we mu&s;t have lain &s;till and done nothing; for it is the nature of all the&s;e <HI>Mahometans</HI> and <HI>Indians,</HI> never to think of the danger, but when it is in the extremity, and then to leave all to the mercy of God, without offering to help them&s;elves, and they will peri&s;h like Bea&s;ts, rather than u&s;e means to get out of the danger: be&s;ides the Seamen do not love to ca&s;t Anchor, becau&s;e of the trouble they are at in weighing it again. In the mean time the Captains Orders were very judicious and &s;ea&s;onable, for we were betwixt <HI>Que&s;chimo, Lareca,</HI> and <HI>Ormus,</HI> and very near all tho&s;e three I&s;lands, that in a manner inlockt us.

Men inclineable to keep on their Cour&s;e; a quarter after one of the Clock, he ordered the Mizan and Sprit-Sails to be trimmed, and the Ships Head turned <HI>North-Ea&s;t,</HI> the Wind being then <HI>North, North-We&s;t:</HI> but immediately after it changed, and for half an hours &s;pace did nothing but &s;hift and turn, through all the <HI>North</HI> Points of the Compa&s;s, betwixt <HI>We&s;t</HI> and <HI>Ea&s;t.</HI> Our Men being then put to a &s;tand, and not knowing what to do, de&s;ired that we might come to Anchor, but the Captain would not, &s;aying that we were in too deep water, and he was in the right, for we had above five and twenty Fathom water. I had pre&s;&s;ed him to it as much as I could, (whil&s;t it was time,) repre&s;enting to him the danger to which his conde&s;cen&s;ion expo&s;ed the Ship, and telling him that a wi&s;e Pilot &s;hould fore|&s;ee the danger that he may prevent it, and not run headlong into the &s;ame; and as he made me an&s;wer, that when he would have done it he was not obeyed, which &s;hewed him to be in a great pa&s;&s;ion; I replyed to him, that on an occa&s;ion, &s;uch as this, he ought to make him&s;elf obeyed; that we had but little day to come, and that in the night-time, we &s;hould be in great danger of Shipwrack, being &s;o near Land.</P>
<P>At length, &s;eeing the Air on all Hands full of tempe&s;tuous Clouds, he ordered the Ships Head to be turned <HI>North-We&s;t,</HI> which was very hard to be done, for the Sea hindered the Ship from coming about, though the Wind was then at <HI>Ea&s;t;</HI> and we &s;tood in to <HI>Que&s;omo,</HI> near which about a quarter after two, we came to an Anchor in &s;even and twenty Fathom water, to the <HI>South</HI> of that I&s;land; &s;o that we put back again above a League. Then the Pilot was for bringing the Yards by the Board, and lowering the Main-Top, and Fore-Top-Ma&s;ts, fearing they might be damaged by the &s;torm; but the Captain would not give way to it. During the re&s;t of the day we had many flurries, with continual &s;howers of Rain; but whil&s;t the&s;e are blowing over, I will enlarge a little in the de&s;cription of the Spouts, which I have only occa&s;ionally mentioned.</P>
<P>I am apt to believe that few have con&s;idered Spouts with &s;o much attention,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A de&s;cription of Spouts.</NOTE> as I did tho&s;e I have been &s;peaking of, and perhaps no man hath made the Ob&s;erva|tions, which chance gave me the occa&s;ion of making; I &s;hall here give an account of them, with that plainne&s;s I profe&s;s in the Relation of all my Travels, thereby to render things mere &s;en&s;ible and ea&s;ie to be comprehended.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t we &s;aw, was to the <HI>Northward,</HI> betwixt us and the I&s;le of <HI>Que&s;omo,</HI> about a Musket &s;hot from the Ship: we were then Steering <HI>North-Ea&s;t.</HI> The fir&s;t thing we perceived in that place was the water boyling up about a Foot high above the &s;urface of the Sea; it looked whiti&s;h, and over it, there appeared &s;omewhat like a blacki&s;h &s;moak, but not very thick; &s;o that the whole looked very like a bundle of &s;traw &s;et on fire, but only as yet &s;moaking, (&s;ee the Figure A:) this made a dull noi&s;e, like to a Torrent running impetuou&s;ly in a deep Valley; but it was mingled with another &s;omewhat more di&s;tinct noi&s;e, re&s;embling the loud hi&s;&s;ing of Serpents or Gee&s;e. A little after, we &s;aw as it were a dark puff of &s;team, much like to a &s;moak which turning very fa&s;t, tapers up to the Clouds; and this puff &s;eemed to be a Pipe as big as ones Finger; (&s;ee the Figure B;) the &s;ame noi&s;e &s;till continuing. Then the light put it out of our &s;ight; and we knew that that Spout was &s;pent, becau&s;e the water boyled no more up; &s;o that it la&s;ted not above half a quarter of an hour. This being &s;pent, we &s;aw another <HI>Southward</HI> of us, which began in the &s;ame manner, as the former did; pre&s;ently after, there appeared another by the &s;ide of this <HI>We&s;tward;</HI> and then a third by the &s;ide of the &s;econd. The mo&s;t remote of the three, might have been &s;omewhat more than a Musket &s;hot di&s;tant from us, and all the three appeared like &s;o many bundles of Straw, a Foot and a half, or two Foot high, that yielded a great deal of &s;moak; (&s;ee the Figure A) and made the very &s;ame noi&s;e that the fir&s;t did. Afterward we &s;aw &s;o many Pipes reaching down from the Clouds, upon the places where the water bubbled, and every one of the&s;e Pipes, at the end which joyned to the Cloud, was as large as the wide end of a Trumpet; and re&s;embled (that I may ex|plain my &s;elf intelligibly) the Teat or Dug of a Bea&s;t, &s;treatched perpendicu|larly downwards by &s;ome weight; (&s;ee the Figure, C.) The&s;e Channels or Pipes &s;eemed to be of a palei&s;h white, and I believe it was the water in the&s;e tran&s;parent Pipes, which made them look white; for in all appearance they were already formed before the water was &s;uckt up in them, as may be judged by what follows; and when they were empty they appeared not; in the &s;ame manner as a
<PB N="186" REF="264">
Gla&s;s-Pipe that is very clear, being &s;et in the light at &s;ome di&s;tance from our Eyes, appears not, unle&s;s it be full of &s;ome coloured liquor. The&s;e Pipes were not &s;treight, but in &s;ome places crooked, (&s;ee the Figure D) neither were they perpendicular; on the contrary, from the Clouds (into which they &s;eemed to be in&s;erted, to the places where they drew up the water,) they &s;loaped very Ob|liquely, as you may &s;ee by the Figure D: and what is more &s;ingular, the Cloud to which the &s;econd of the&s;e three was fa&s;tened, having been driven by the Wind, the Pipe followed it without breaking, or leaving the place where it drew up the water, and pa&s;&s;ing behind the Pipe of the fir&s;t, they made for &s;ometime a <HI>Saltier,</HI> or the Figure of St. <HI>Andrews</HI> Cro&s;s, (&s;ee the Figure E,) in the beginning they were all three as big as ones Finger, as I have already ob&s;erved; but in the pro|gre&s;s, the fir&s;t of the three, &s;welled to a con&s;iderable bigne&s;s. I can &s;ay nothing of the other two, for the la&s;t that was formed was almo&s;t as &s;oon &s;pent: that to the <HI>South</HI> continued about a quarter of an hour; but the fir&s;t on the &s;ame &s;ide, la&s;ted &s;omewhat longer, and was that which put us into the greate&s;t fear, and whereof I have &s;till &s;omewhat more to &s;ay: at fir&s;t the Pipe of it was as big as ones Finger, then it &s;welled as big as a mans Arm, after that as big as ones Leg, and at length as big as the Trunk of a good Tree, as much as a Man can Fathom about; (&s;ee the Figure F.) We could plainly &s;ee through that tran&s;parent body, the water winding and turning as it mounted up; and now and then the thickne&s;s of it decrea&s;ed, &s;ometimes at the top; (&s;ee the Figure G;) and &s;ometimes at the Root; (&s;ee the Figure H.) At that time it exactly re&s;&s;embled a Gut filled with &s;ome fluid matter, and pre&s;&s;ed with ones Fingers, either above, to make the liquor de|&s;cend; or below, to make it mount up; and I was per&s;uaded that the violence of the Wind made the&s;e alterations, making the water mount very fa&s;t when it forced upon the lower end of the Pipe, and making it de&s;cend, when it pre&s;&s;ed the upper part: after that, the bigne&s;s of it &s;o le&s;&s;ened, that it was le&s;s than a Mans Arm, like a Gut when it is &s;trained and drawn perpendicularly out in length; then it grew as big as ones Thigh, and afterwards dwindled again very &s;mall. At length I perceived that the boyling on the &s;urface of the Sea began to &s;ettle, and the end of the Pipe that touched it, &s;eparated from it, and &s;hrunk together, as if it had been tied; (&s;ee the Figure I,) and then the light (which appeared by the blowing away of a Cloud,) made me lo&s;e fight of it; however I &s;till lookt out for &s;ome time, if I might &s;ee it again, becau&s;e I had ob&s;erved, that the Pipe of the &s;econd on that &s;ide, had appeared to us three or four times, to break &s;hort off in the middle, and that immediately after, we had &s;een it whole again, one half of it being only hid from us by the light; but it was to no purpo&s;e for me to look &s;harply out; for this appeared no more; &s;o that there was an end of our Spouts, and I gave God thanks, (as all the other <HI>Franks</HI> did,) that he had delivered us from them. They attributed that mercy to the Holy Go&s;pel, which I had &s;aid, where|in I arrogate nothing to my &s;elf, being not &s;o unrea&s;onable as to think that my merit contributed any thing; but perhaps God had &s;ome re&s;pect to our good intention, and the tru&s;t that all of us repo&s;ed on his Holy Go&s;pel. In fine, there is nothing more certain, than that notwith&s;tanding the incon&s;tancy of the Wind which &s;hifted all Points, none of the&s;e Spouts came nearer us, than the place where fir&s;t they began; and this I may with &s;incerity affirm, that in all dangers of Storms, Pirats, and other accidents, wherein I have been often engaged, it was always my practi&s;e, to rehear&s;e this Holy Go&s;pel, and God in his great mercy hath pre|&s;erved me from all.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The effects of Spouts.</NOTE>The&s;e Spouts are very dangerous at Sea, for if they come upon a Ship, they entangle the Sails, &s;o that &s;ometimes they will lift it up, and then letting it fall down again, &s;ink it to the bottom; which chiefly happens when the Ve&s;&s;el is &s;mall; but if they lift not up the Ship, at lea&s;t they Split all the Sails, or el&s;e empty all their water into it, which &s;inks it to rights; and I make no doubt, but that many Ships that have no more been heard of, have been lo&s;t by &s;uch accidents: &s;eeing we have but too many in&s;tances of tho&s;e which have been known to have peri&s;hed &s;o of a certain. Be&s;ides the Devotion of the Holy Go&s;pel, the human remedies which Sea-men u&s;e again&s;t Spouts, is to furle all the Sails, and to fire &s;ome Guns with &s;hot again&s;t the Pipe of the Spout; and that their &s;hot may be &s;urer to hit, in&s;tead of Bullet, they charge the Gun with a cro&s;s-bar-&s;hot, wherewith they endeavour to cut the Pipe, if the Spout be within &s;hot of them; and when they have the
<PB N="187" REF="264">
good luck to level their &s;hot ju&s;t, they fail not to cut it &s;hort off: this is the Cour&s;e they take in the Mediteranean Sea; but if that &s;ucceed not, they betake them&s;elves to the Super&s;tition, which I would not practi&s;e, though I knew it, having learned it in my former Travels. One of the Ships Company kneels down by the Main-Ma&s;t, and holding in one Hand a Knife with a Black Handle (with|out which they never go on Board for that rea&s;on) he Reads the Go&s;pel of St. <HI>John,</HI> and when he comes to pronounce tho&s;e Holy words, <HI>Et verbum caro factum e&s;t, &amp; habitavit in nobis,</HI> he turns towards the Spout, and with his Knife cuts the Air athwart that Spout, as if he would cut it, and they &s;ay that then it is really cut, and lets all the water it held fall with a great noi&s;e. This is the account that I have had from &s;everal <HI>French</HI> Men, who, (as they &s;aid,) had tried it them&s;elves; whether that hath &s;ucceeded &s;o or not, I know not; but for the Knife with the black Handle, it is a foul Super&s;tition, which may be accompanied with &s;ome implicit compact with the Devil, and I do not think that a Chri&s;tian can with a good Con&s;cience make u&s;e of it: as to the vertue of the&s;e Holy words, which (as I may &s;ay,) put God in mind of the Covenant that he hath made with Man, I make no doubt, but that being &s;aid with Devotion, without any mixture of Super&s;tition, they are of great efficacy to draw a ble&s;&s;ing from God upon us on all occa&s;ions.</P>
<P>And &s;o much for the Spouts by which we were more affraid than hurt; but the Storm did our Ship more prejudice in its Cour&s;e; for we were obliged to lye at Anchor all that day and the night following, until next morning, when though it blew very hard from <HI>North-Ea&s;t,</HI> we weighed at &s;even a Clock, and &s;tood away <HI>Ea&s;t, South-Ea&s;t.</HI> About nine a Clock we Sailed along <HI>Lareca,</HI> which was to the Windward or Larboard of us. About three quarters after nine, we &s;aw the Sky on Head over ca&s;t, and the Air black, with &s;tormy Clouds and flurries, but they were to the Leeward of us, and therefore at fir&s;t we dreaded them not; but having more attentively con&s;idered them, we found that they came from <HI>South</HI> to <HI>North,</HI> and &s;eeing it blew fre&s;her and fre&s;her, perhaps becau&s;e of the re&s;i&s;tance it met with from tho&s;e Clouds driven by a contrary Wind, we furled our Mizan Sail, and Steered away <HI>South-Ea&s;t</HI> and by <HI>Ea&s;t,</HI> that we might avoid the Storm. About a quarter after ten we took in all our Sails, except the Main Cour&s;e and Sprit-Sail. About half an hour after ten, it cleared up to the <HI>South,</HI> and we made the bigge&s;t of the four I&s;les of Cape <HI>Mo&s;andon,</HI> (called <HI>Selame</HI>) which bore <HI>South</HI> and by <HI>We&s;t</HI> of us; and at the &s;ame time we made the fourth of the&s;e little I&s;les, which we had not &s;een before; to the <HI>South</HI> and by <HI>Ea&s;t.</HI> This little I&s;le lyes to the <HI>Southward</HI> of the bigge&s;t, and is not far from it; it &s;eemed to me to reach <HI>North</HI> and <HI>South,</HI> and is very low Land, except at the end towards the big I&s;land, where it ri&s;es a little. About three quarters after ten, we &s;et our Mizan and Main-Top-Sail again, and &s;tood our Cour&s;e <HI>South-Ea&s;t,</HI> the Wind be|ing then <HI>North-Ea&s;t</HI> and by <HI>Ea&s;t,</HI> and immediately after, we had a &s;hower of Rain: For two hours after, the Wind did nothing but chop and change, from <HI>North-Ea&s;t</HI> to <HI>South-Ea&s;t;</HI> and all that while we kept on our Cour&s;e, as much as the little Wind that then blew would allow us. At one of the Clock we were got very near <HI>Lareca,</HI> &s;tanding <HI>North</HI> and by <HI>Ea&s;t,</HI> and therefore we tacked about and bore away <HI>South</HI> and by <HI>Ea&s;t,</HI> the Wind being then <HI>Ea&s;t</HI> and by <HI>North.</HI> About two a Clock we &s;tood <HI>South-Ea&s;t</HI> and by <HI>South.</HI> About &s;even a Clock it blew hard from <HI>North-Ea&s;t,</HI> and we Steered our Cour&s;e <HI>Ea&s;t, South-Ea&s;t.</HI> About eight a Clock it blew a &s;tiff Gale from <HI>South, South-Ea&s;t,</HI> and we Steered <HI>Ea&s;t..</HI> Three quarters after eight it got into <HI>South,</HI> and we bore away <HI>Ea&s;t, South-Ea&s;t;</HI> a quarter of an hour after, we had &s;ome Rain. In this manner every hour, or every half hour the Wind &s;hifted about; and with every change we had a &s;cud of Wind and Rain; which obliged us to furl all our Sails but the Fore-Sail, but &s;o &s;oon as the flurry was over; the Wind was but very ea&s;ie. Thus all night long we had flurries, and changes of Wind.</P>
<P><HI>Sunday</HI> the thirteenth of <HI>December,</HI> at &s;ix a Clock in the morning, the Wind turned <HI>Ea&s;t, South-Ea&s;t,</HI> and we &s;tood away <HI>South.</HI> We had to the Starboard the Land of <HI>Arabia,</HI> and the four I&s;les of <HI>Selame,</HI> of which the bigge&s;t bore <HI>We&s;t</HI> and by <HI>South</HI> of us: on our Larboard we had the Land of <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> part whereof called <HI>Mar&s;an,</HI> bore <HI>South-Ea&s;t</HI> of us, and we made particularly one Hill of that Land, &s;haped like a Sugar-Loaf. About &s;even a Clock the Wind &s;hifted into

<HI>South-Ea&s;t,</HI> but it was an ea&s;ie Gale, and we Steered <HI>Ea&s;t, North-Ea&s;t.</HI> About nine a Clock we had the bigge&s;t of the I&s;les of <HI>Selame</HI> to the <HI>South-We&s;t</HI> and by <HI>We&s;t</HI> of us, and the Port of <HI>Lima</HI> to the <HI>South-We&s;t</HI> and by <HI>South.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Lima</HI> is a very good Port in <HI>Arabia</HI> the happy, where &s;everal Ships may Winter &s;ecure from all Winds, and there is good water there.

<P><HI>Tue&s;day</HI> the fifteenth of <HI>December,</HI> about &s;even a Clock in the morning we were clo&s;e in with the Land of <HI>Arabia,</HI> and the Wind was then at <HI>South, South-Ea&s;t,</HI> and therefore we &s;tood away <HI>Ea&s;t:</HI> but about nine a Clock the Wind &s;hifting to <HI>South-Ea&s;t,</HI> we were obliged to tack, and &s;tand away <HI>South, South-We&s;t.</HI> About eleven a Clock the Wind came to <HI>South,</HI> and we Steered <HI>North</HI> and by <HI>Ea&s;t,</HI> that we might put into <HI>Lareca</HI> and <HI>Ormus,</HI> and wait for a favourable Wind in one of tho&s;e two I&s;lands, being weary of beating up and down in this manner, and making no progre&s;s in our Voyage; which only wore our Sails; and be&s;ides, we made account to take in water there; for we were apprehen&s;ive it might fall &s;hort.</P>
<P>In the mean time this de&s;ign was not without contradiction on the part of the Mate and Sea-men, as well as of the Merchants, who could not willingly re&s;olve to lo&s;e that little way we had made: however the Captain did as he intended, and in the &s;equel they were all glad of it, when about half an hour after three they perceived the Heavens over-ca&s;t with thick Clouds, which &s;hortly after broke out into bitter gu&s;ts of Wind and Rain,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Other Spouts.</NOTE> with three Spouts more, but at a di&s;tance from us. Then did all applaud the Captains Orders; every one being of opinion that if we had been &s;urpri&s;ed with that &s;torm in the Streight where we were in the morning, we &s;hould have been hard put to it, and it even appeared vi&s;ibly to us, to be more violent in that part than any where el&s;e.</P>
<P>Neverthele&s;s as it is u&s;ual with tho&s;e kind of Men never to fear danger but when it is pre&s;ent; no &s;ooner did it begin to blow from <HI>South-We&s;t</HI> about five a Clock, but the Merchants per&s;uaded the Mate to pray the Captain to &s;et Sail again and pur&s;ue our Cour&s;e: he pre&s;ently conde&s;cended out of &s;pight; for he no ways approved the de&s;ign, nor indeed had he rea&s;on; a fierce Wind &s;till blowing with &s;everal Gu&s;ts and flurries; however he ordered to Steer away <HI>South, South-Ea&s;t.</HI> About &s;ix a Clock at night, the &s;o much longed for <HI>North</HI> Wind began to blow, but it was &s;o
<PB N="189" REF="265">
high that we could carry no Sails but the Fore-Sail and Sprit-Sail, and there went a rough Sea on Head, that furiou&s;ly beat again&s;t the Ship: in the mean time we Steered away <HI>South</HI> and by <HI>Ea&s;t,</HI> that we might not be Land lockt by the Cape of <HI>Mo&s;andon,</HI> which we had on Head. About &s;even a Clock the Wind &s;lackened much, and we let loo&s;e the Main-Sail; though we had &s;till &s;everal gu&s;ts of Wind and Rain; we had be&s;ides the Currents to &s;truggle with, which turned the Ships Head towards the Coa&s;t of <HI>Arabia</HI> with &s;o much force, that it was &s;ometimes above a quarter of an hour before the Ship could be brought about again to our right Cour&s;e of <HI>South</HI> and by <HI>Ea&s;t.</HI> The Sea became &s;moother in the night-time, though the Wind fre&s;hened a little.</P>

About a quarter after four a Clock, we were got within a League and a half of the &s;hoar of <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> off and on with a place, where there are high white Hills, a little up on the Land; which with a blacki&s;h Rock, that ranges all along the Sea-&s;ide, makes a very plea&s;ant pro&s;pect: for &s;eeing at a di&s;tance over that black, a great many pieces of white Rock that ri&s;e in various figures; one would take it to be a City; and to the <HI>South</HI> of that imaginary Town, upon the &s;ame Hill, there is a piece of whitei&s;h Rock broken off from the re&s;t, which looks like a Tower or Pillar upon a high Pede&s;tal; from thence it is but a League to <HI>Bombareca.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Bombareca.</NOTE> Half an hour after five we were off of <HI>Bombareca,</HI> which is only a very high &s;quare, white Rock; and flat on the top; it &s;eems to be very &s;teep, and at a di&s;tance one would take it for a &s;quare Fort: this Rock is very near the Land, and it is dangerous to approach it, becau&s;e it is &s;urrounded with a Bank of Sand. A little after, we came up with the Ships that were on Head of us, and after the <HI>Selame</HI> or mutual Hailing, they told us that it was but &s;ix days &s;ince they parted from <HI>Congo;</HI> they had all &s;igned Indentures to go in Con&s;ort, and not to leave one another till they came to <HI>Sur|rat;</HI> neverthele&s;s one of them Hailed us, and told us that if we would go in Con|&s;ort with him, he would leave the re&s;t; and our Captain and the Mate who&s;e Bro|ther was Mate of the other Ship, having made an&s;wer that they were content, he packt on all the Sail he could and followed us. About &s;ix a Clock we got a Head of the Headmo&s;t of all the Ships, and our Men handed the Main-Top-Galant-Sail, and would have furled the Main-Sail, to &s;tay for our Con&s;ort, who was a Stern of us; but the Captain would fir&s;t have the con&s;ent of the <HI>Souhre&s;eart,</HI> who was not of the &s;ame mind, &s;aying it was better to make the be&s;t of our way whil&s;t the Wind was good: &s;o that we only took in our Main-Top-Galant-Sail, and Steered our Cour&s;e <HI>South-Ea&s;t</HI> and by <HI>South.</HI> The Sea-men in the mean time kept a heavy muttering that we &s;hould leave the other Ship, after we had promi&s;ed to &s;tay for her, and occa&s;ioned her leaving of the re&s;t: but the clutter was far greater, when our Mate who had turned in, came out, after an hours &s;leep, and not &s;eeing our Con&s;ort, would needs &s;pare Sail; for when he was told what re&s;olution had been taken, he made a fearful noi&s;e, complaining of our breach of promi&s;e; but after all he was fain to have patience.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. IV.</HI> Of the re&s;t of the Voyage to the <HI>Indies.</HI></HEAD>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">An Invention for Reckoning the Ships way.</NOTE><HI>WEdne&s;day</HI> about Sun &s;et, we began to keep reckoning of our way, which is done in this manner. At the Stern of the Ship they heave out a little piece of board, about half a Foot long, four Inches broad, and very thin and &s;mooth, which is fa&s;tened to a Line; at the &s;ame time they turn a minute Sand-Gla&s;s, which is the &s;ixtieth part of an hour; and &s;o long as this minute is running, they veer off the Line, but &s;top it &s;o &s;oon as the the Gla&s;s is out; and when they have pulled it up, they reckon how many Fathom have run off in that minutes time, allowing for every &s;even Fathom a Miles running in an hour. But it is to be ob|&s;erved that before the Gla&s;s be turned, they let off with the Log fourteen Fathom of the Line, and the&s;e fourteen Fathom are not accounted in the reckoning, for they reckon none but tho&s;e that run off whil&s;t the Gla&s;s is running; and there|fore there is a mark to di&s;tingui&s;h the beginning from the end of the fir&s;t four|teen; and at the in&s;tant that that mark begins to go off, they turn the minute Gla&s;s. This reckoning is found by experience to be pretty ju&s;t; and thereupon I told our Captain, that I had &s;een the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> do the &s;ame thing in the <HI>Mediterra|nean,</HI> &s;ave that they did not allow tho&s;e fourteen fir&s;t Fathom, and that they u&s;ed but half a minute Gla&s;s, or the hundred and twentieth part of an hour, and that neverthele&s;s they reckoned &s;even Fathom of the Line that run off during that mi|nute for a Mile an hour of the Ships way; that according to that reckoning, he ought to allow fourteen Fathom for an hour, his being a minute Gla&s;s, and cut off the&s;e fir&s;t fourteen. He made me no other an&s;wer, but that the Currents of the Ocean&punc; were &s;tronger than tho&s;e of the <HI>Mediterranean:</HI> neverthele&s;s, one would think that &s;ince they reckon not tho&s;e fourteen Fathom, and turn not the Gla&s;s till they be run out, they are altogether u&s;ele&s;s; unle&s;s it be, perhaps, that they let them run off, to the end that when tho&s;e which they reckon begin to run, the Log may be &s;o far off, that the Sea which beats again&s;t the Ship, may not drive it neither forwards nor backwards: and indeed before the Gla&s;s be turned, they take notice whether or not the Log runs &s;treight in the Ships wake; and there is a red mark at the place where they begin to reckon, to prevent their being mi&s;taken: other|wi&s;e if they &s;hould reckon as &s;oon as they heaved out the Log, the Ship runs &s;ome times &s;o fa&s;t, that they would not have time to con&s;ider whether or not the Log, we<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">t &s;treight in the Ships way. Once an hour they heave that Log, and then mark down every time how many knots or Fathoms of the Line has run out; and every day at noon they ca&s;t up the account of their running; &s;o that they reckon by this means, how many Miles the Ship has run in four and twenty hours; (that is to &s;ay,) from noon of the preceeding, to noon of the pre&s;ent day; and this they &s;et off with a Compa&s;s upon the Sea Chart, that they may know where the Ship is. Though this be a very u&s;eful invention, yet it is not too much to be relyed upon; el&s;e they would be in danger of committing great errours at Sea, becau&s;e of the Tides and Currents, that either drive the Log forwards or backwards; and to be a&s;&s;ured of the exactne&s;s of that account, the Log mu&s;t be fixed and immoveable. But the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> are not mi&s;taken, for be&s;ides that invention of Miles, they dayly take an ob&s;ervation of the Suns height: be&s;ides they heave out the Log, at every change, encrea&s;e or decrea&s;e of the Wind. The <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> reckon their Miles, at five hundred Geometrical paces only, (that is,) five Foot to the pace.</P>

<P><HI>Thur&s;day</HI> the &s;eventeenth of <HI>December,</HI> about &s;ix a Clock in the morning, we clapt on our Main-Top-Galant-Sail, and &s;tood away <HI>Ea&s;t,</HI> keeping in &s;ight of the Land of <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> lea&s;t the Wind might force us too far out to Sea, which about eleven a Clock turned <HI>North-Ea&s;t.</HI> At noon we found that from Sun &s;etting the day before, we had run three&s;core and one Miles, or twenty Leagues, and a third, at the rate of three Miles a League. At one of the Clock, we bore away <HI>Ea&s;t</HI> and by <HI>South.</HI> About four a Clock, the Wind chopping about to <HI>We&s;t,</HI> we bore away <HI>South-Ea&s;t</HI> and by <HI>Ea&s;t.</HI> About half an hour after five, we had <HI>Ea&s;t, North-Ea&s;t</HI> of us, a little low I&s;le, clo&s;e by the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> &s;hoar, which in that place is very low. About &s;ix a Clock we were off and on with that little I&s;le. <HI>Friday</HI> the eighteenth of <HI>December</HI> in the morning, we Steered our Cour&s;e <HI>Ea&s;t</HI> and by <HI>South;</HI> and at noon we found that from that time the day before, we had made eight and thirty Leagues: then the Wind got into <HI>North-We&s;t,</HI> and we bore away <HI>South-Ea&s;t</HI> and by <HI>Ea&s;t,</HI> that we might not run within Land, which we ob&s;curely made on Head, a little to the Larboard.</P>
<P>Next morning the Wind abated, and therefore we &s;tood away <HI>Ea&s;t</HI> and by <HI>South.</HI> At noon we found by our reckoning, that we had in the la&s;t four and twenty hours, made five and twenty Leagues and a half. Then the Captain, Mate, and Gunner took an Ob&s;ervation of the Sums height with a Quadrant, as well as they could; for none of the three had much skill in it, and the Ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">e lea&s;t of all: all three agreed that we were in twenty four degrees, thirty minutes Latitude. About evening the Wind &s;hifted into <HI>South-We&s;t,</HI> but it was &s;o ea&s;ie that &s;carcely did it curl the water; yet we Steered away <HI>South-Ea&s;t</HI> and by <HI>Ea&s;t,</HI> that we might not be ca&s;t a &s;hoar.</P>
<P><HI>Sunday</HI> the twentieth of <HI>December</HI> it continued &s;till calm weather, &s;o that at noon, we found we had made but five Leagues way, and our Men having taken their Ob&s;ervation, found that we were &s;till in the Latitude of twenty four degrees thirty minutes, as we were the day before: and that day every one was &s;tinted to a mea|&s;ure and a half of water by day. Towards the evening we made the Land of <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> and were but about five Leagues off of it, which made us Steer away <HI>South-Ea&s;t</HI> and by <HI>South,</HI> and &s;tand out to Sea, contrary to the opinion of the Mate who would have kept in by the Shoar, giving this rea&s;on for it, that we needed not fear to be ca&s;t too far to the Leeward, as the Captain &s;aid, becau&s;e at that time the <HI>Ea&s;t</HI> Wind blows along the Coa&s;t of <HI>Sindy;</HI> and be&s;ides, being near Land, in ca&s;e it proved bad weather, we might come to an Anchor, and take in water, which we were affraid we might come to want. But the chief rea&s;on why he would have &s;tood in to &s;hoar, and which he kept to him&s;elf, was that he might know the place where he was, for the&s;e are &s;uch an ignorant &s;ort of Men, that &s;o &s;oon as they lo&s;e &s;ight of Land, they know no more where they are. The Captain made an&s;wer to all his rea&s;ons, that it was bad advice, to make us double our way without any nece&s;&s;ity, and that we had no rea&s;on to go look for <HI>Ea&s;t</HI> Winds, having the Wind at <HI>South-We&s;t,</HI> which though it was ea&s;ie, &s;till kept us going on in our Cour&s;e, and would, (if it fre&s;hened,) bring us in a &s;hort time whither we were bound; and in that ca&s;e, we needed not go look for water, whereof as yet we had no want: be&s;ides that, by &s;tanding in to &s;hoar, we run a risk of meeting the <HI>Zinganes,</HI> tho&s;e Pirats I mentioned before, whom no body de&s;ired to &s;ee; and we put our &s;elves al&s;o in danger of not being able to get out to Sea again for a long time, if the Wind (which we had,) la&s;ted, becau&s;e we mu&s;t wait for another Wind, which perhaps, might not offer in &s;ome weeks time. In fine, it behoved the Pilot to acquie&s;ce to this judgment, which was approved by all of us; nay the Gunner was for having us &s;teer our Cour&s;e more to the <HI>Southward,</HI> and he was not out in that; for the Coa&s;t of Cape <HI>Ja&s;ques</HI> bears <HI>We&s;t</HI> and by <HI>North,</HI> and <HI>Ea&s;t</HI> and by <HI>South,</HI> and we Steered <HI>South-Ea&s;t</HI> and by <HI>Ea&s;t,</HI> from which &s;ub&s;tracting a Point and a half which is the variation of the<PB N="192" REF="267">

<P><HI>Monday</HI> the one and twentieth of <HI>December,</HI> our Ob&s;ervers found at noon that we were in twenty four degrees twenty five minutes Latitude, and that we had run ten Leagues.</P>
<P>Next day they found twenty four degrees five minutes Latitude, and that we had run fourteen Leagues the la&s;t twenty four hours. About four a Clock in the afternoon the Heaven was on all Hands overca&s;t with thick black Clouds, and at the &s;ame time there aro&s;e a &s;mall Gale from <HI>We&s;t, North-We&s;t,</HI> which pre&s;ently drove the Clouds upon us; we expected a &s;trong Gu&s;t of Wind, but we were excu&s;ed for a &s;hower of Rain, which was indeed violent, but la&s;ted not, without any flurry of Wind, or rough water, for the Sea was not at all moved. At the &s;ame time the&s;e Storms began to appear in the Air, others began to work in our Captains Head, which cau&s;ed a real Tempe&s;t in the Ship. He had drunk &s;everal Cups of Brandy, which began to heat his Brains; however he ordered the Sails to be taken in, as it is u&s;ual when they &s;ee a Storm a comeing: but pre&s;ently after, a fancy taking him in the Head, that they accu&s;ed him of timorou&s;ne&s;s, and &s;ay|ing that he had heard &s;ome &s;ay he was affraid, though no body had &s;poken a word; he fell into a &s;udden rage, and (to &s;hew that he was a Man of Courage,) commanded all the Sails high and low to be &s;et again, though the Mate prayed him not to do it, and that the Sea-men &s;tayed two or three Orders before they obeyed him; which incen&s;ing him the more, he &s;wore that the Sails &s;hould &s;tand, what&s;oever weather blew, that he might make tho&s;e dy for fear, that had &s;aid he was affraid, adding a thou&s;and more impertinent raveings. Never did Captain on a Stage &s;hew &s;o many Rodomontadoes, and that for &s;everal hours, during which he tried all the Ships patience, without the lea&s;t word of an&s;wer from any Man. At four a Clock the Wind turning <HI>We&s;t,</HI> we &s;tood away <HI>Ea&s;t, South-Ea&s;t.</HI> Half an hour after four, we had a great &s;hower of Rain, which &s;oon was over, and immediately after, the Wind fell a &s;hifting into all the Points, till at length it &s;ettled at <HI>North-Ea&s;t,</HI> and we bore away <HI>Ea&s;t, South-Ea&s;t.</HI> In the mean time all our Sails were abroad, except the Main-Top-Galant-Sail, which he had like|wi&s;e cau&s;ed to be put on, but was immediately after taken in. About &s;ix a Clock the Wind veering about to <HI>Ea&s;t,</HI> we Steered away <HI>South, South-Ea&s;t.</HI> At &s;even a Clock we were more becalmed than before, and we turned the Ships Head <HI>Ea&s;t</HI> and by <HI>South.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Wedne&s;day</HI> morning the three and twentieth of <HI>December,</HI> one of our Sea-men took with a Hook a Fi&s;h called a <HI>Dorado,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Dorado,</HI> a Fi&s;h.</NOTE> which was about two Foot long, and four Inches broad from the middle of the Back to the middle of the Belly, but not very thick; the Skin a long the Back, and half way the Sides of it, was of a Violet blue, and the Belly of a yellowi&s;h white, but full of little round Violet coloured &s;pecks; it had along the Back a blue Skin, &s;treatched as it were, upon little bones or prickles, which made it bri&s;tle up about an inch and a half high: the Eyes of it were large and round; under the Gills, it had on each &s;ide a Fin three Fingers breadth long, which &s;tood out very &s;treight; and two others under the Throat, near one another, and another at the Roots, and then widening by de|grees to the points, it had two more of the &s;ame fa&s;hion near the Tail; but it had no Teeth. It was very brisk and lively when it was pulled out of the water; but as the force of it &s;pent, that Skin which before was &s;treatched like a piece of Cloath, upright upon the Back of it, flagged and fell flat to the Body as well as its Fins. They told me that there were &s;ome of tho&s;e Fi&s;h a Fathom and a half long, that they call them <HI>Doradoes,</HI> that is to &s;ay gilt, becau&s;e the ground of their Skin, is in &s;ome manner of the colour of Gold; the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> call them Dolphins. It is good meat and of ea&s;ie dige&s;tion; the Fle&s;h of it is firm and
<PB N="193" REF="267">
delicate, and it feeds on a kind of &s;mall flying Fi&s;h, which being pur&s;ued, ri&s;e out of the water, and fly above a Ships length, falling &s;ometimes into Ships, as one did into ours. On <HI>Sunday</HI> the &s;even and twentieth of <HI>December,</HI> I handled and con&s;idered it at lei&s;ure; it was &s;haped like a Herring, and &s;even inches long; the Back of it was of a very dark blue, and the Belly white; on each &s;ide it had a Wing almo&s;t five inches long, and about four inches broad: the&s;e Wings are only a thin Skin of a very ob&s;cure blue colour, &s;treatched upon little Nerves or Bones, which reach from the &s;ide of the Fi&s;h, to the extremity of the Skin. When it is pur&s;ued by the <HI>Doradoes</HI> it leaps out of the Water, and flies in the Air &s;o long as the Wings of it are moi&s;t, and when they dry it falls again into the water. When the&s;e Wings are dry they fold together like a Fan, and that Fi&s;hes Wings which I Handled were folded in that manner; it is very good to eat.</P>
<P>We could have no Ob&s;ervation at noon, becau&s;e the Sun was over Clouded, and mu&s;t then be &s;atisfied with our dead reckoning, according to which we had made but nine Leagues from noon to noon. At eight a Clock at night, a Coal of fire fell out of a Tobacco-Pipe into the Gun-Room, through the hole of the Whip-&s;taff; and by good fortune the two Women &s;laves of <HI>Manuel Mendez,</HI> (who lodged in that place,) &s;oon perceived it, and put it out; and then being all in a fright, they cried out for help: they who had done this were enquired after, but in vain, for it was impo&s;&s;ible to find out the Authors: had not God in his great mercy pre&s;erved us from the danger of that accident, we mu&s;t all have unfortu|nately peri&s;hed.</P>
<P><HI>Thur&s;day</HI> the four and twentieth of <HI>December,</HI> at four of the Clock in the morning there fell a great deal of Rain, and it continued &s;howring by intervals, with great Thunder-Claps, till half an hour after &s;ix: when the Rain was quite over, we had a good Wind from <HI>North-We&s;t,</HI> which made us run a League and a half an hour; but it was clo&s;e weather, and the Captain ordered to Steer away <HI>Ea&s;t,</HI> whereby we altered our Cour&s;e, and &s;tood in to Land; when I asked him the rea&s;on of it, he told me, he was affraid he might find the Wind at <HI>Ea&s;t, North-Ea&s;t,</HI> which would force us out from the place to which we were bound: but the truth was, he had a mind to make the Land, that he might know where we were; for neither he, the mate, nor Gunner could tell it. At eight a Clock the Wind turned <HI>Ea&s;terly,</HI> and we &s;tood away <HI>South, South-Ea&s;t.</HI> At nine a Clock it &s;hifted to <HI>South-Ea&s;t,</HI> and we Steered <HI>South,</HI> which was a very bad Cour&s;e, for following it we mu&s;t have run far below the place whither we were bound. About ten a Clock the Wind being got into the <HI>South, South-Ea&s;t;</HI> we bore away <HI>Ea&s;t;</HI> but all of a &s;udden the Wind &s;lackened. At noon we had the Wind at <HI>South,</HI> and we Steered away <HI>Ea&s;t, South-Ea&s;t.</HI> We could have no Ob&s;ervation this day neither, becau&s;e of Cloudy weather, and they found by their dead Reckoning that we had made nine Leagues: mo&s;t of this way we had made &s;ince &s;ix a Clock in the morning, for the eighteen hours before, we had advanced but little or nothing at all. A quarter after twelve, the Wind turned <HI>South-We&s;t,</HI> and we Steered our Cour&s;e <HI>North-Ea&s;t,</HI> but we were pre&s;ently after becalmed. At two a Clock we had a breeze from <HI>North-We&s;t,</HI> and we bore away <HI>South-Ea&s;t</HI> and by <HI>Ea&s;t.</HI> About &s;ix a Clock the Wind &s;lackened much. About &s;even a Clock our Ships Head &s;tood <HI>South-Ea&s;t.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Friday</HI> the five and twentieth of <HI>December,</HI> at &s;ix a Clock in the morning, it blew a <HI>We&s;t, North-We&s;t</HI> Wind, and we &s;teered on our Cour&s;e &s;till <HI>South-Ea&s;t.</HI> About &s;even a Clock the Sky was overca&s;t with Clouds, which brought Rain with them, and we &s;aw &s;ome more Spouts at a pretty good di&s;tance, and a Weather-Gall: this Weather-Gall was like a Segment of a Rain-Bow, ri&s;ing from the Horizon about three degrees; or, if you will, it &s;eemed to be three Foot high. Some|times they appear over a Ship, and that is commonly a pre&s;age of a Tempe&s;t; and the <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> call this <HI>Phenomenon</HI> an (Oxes Eye.) About eight a Clock it blew a pretty fre&s;h Gale from <HI>North;</HI> but immediately it veered about to <HI>North-Ea&s;t,</HI> and became very weak. At noon we were by our Ob&s;ervations in three and twenty degrees two and fifty minutes Latitude, and had made from noon to noon, thirteen Leagues. Then the Captain and Mate made account that we were eight
<PB N="194" REF="268">
or ten Leagues off of the Land of <HI>Sindy,</HI> and about five and twenty Leagues from <HI>Jaquelte:</HI> for my part, by what I could make out by my Map, we were twenty Leagues off,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Malan.</NOTE> and to the <HI>Southward</HI> of <HI>Malan,</HI> and forty Leagues from <HI>Sindy,</HI> and near three&s;core Leagues from <HI>Jaquelte,</HI> and this agreed with the Gunners Ob&s;er|vation; but he dur&s;t not &s;ay any thing, for fear of quarelling with the Captain, who thought every body ignorant in re&s;pect of him&s;elf; and neverthele&s;s it was found afterwards that he and the Mate were in the mi&s;take. About four a Clock, the Wind turned <HI>Ea&s;t, South-Ea&s;t,</HI> and we Steered <HI>North-Ea&s;t.</HI> About five a Clock we had a great &s;hower of Rain from a thick Cloud over head, which being pa&s;t, we had the Wind at <HI>South-Ea&s;t,</HI> and bore away <HI>North-Ea&s;t.</HI> Half an hour after &s;ix, we had Rain again with Lightning, but we were becalmed, and turned the Ships Head <HI>North-Ea&s;t.</HI> At &s;even a Clock the Wind turned <HI>South</HI> and by <HI>Ea&s;t,</HI> and we bore away <HI>Ea&s;t</HI> and by <HI>South.</HI> Half an hour after ten, we were becalmed; but about eleven a Clock had a great flurry, which made much noi&s;e at fir&s;t, and this made us furl all our Sails; but a great &s;hower of Rain &s;oon carried it off, and the Sea being &s;mooth, we Steered away <HI>South-Ea&s;t</HI> and by <HI>South.</HI> At midnight we ca&s;t the Lead, but though they veered out &s;ixty Fathom of Rope, yet we had no ground, which was like to have made the Captain mad for &s;hame; for he believed us to be very near Land, and he fell into a Pa&s;&s;ion with the Mate, &s;aying that he had not left importuning him for two days to heave out the Lead. We were all night becalmed, though at times we had &s;everal &s;howers of Rain.</P>
<P><HI>Saturday</HI> the &s;ix and twentieth of <HI>December,</HI> about &s;even a Clock, there blew a gentle Gale from <HI>Ea&s;t, North-Ea&s;t,</HI> which made us Steer away <HI>South-Ea&s;t</HI> and by <HI>South.</HI> About half an hour after nine, the Wind being all <HI>Ea&s;terly,</HI> we &s;tood away <HI>South-Ea&s;t:</HI> then ma&s;ter <HI>Manuel Mendez,</HI> (who perceived very well that no body knew where we were;) advi&s;ed the Captain to &s;tand in to Land and gratifie the Pilot, which highly offended him, &s;aying that &s;ince they took him for an igno|rant blockhead, for the future he would only &s;leep and take his re&s;t, and let the Ship go which way &s;he plea&s;ed; and that to content us, he would put back and make the Land at <HI>Ja&s;ques;</HI> however this went no farther. About ten a Clock the Wind turned <HI>Ea&s;t, North-Ea&s;t,</HI> and we &s;tood away <HI>South-Ea&s;t.</HI> At noon the Gunner found by his Ob&s;ervations that we were in twenty three degrees forty five minutes, the Captain, in twenty three degrees five minutes, and the Mate in twenty three fifteen minutes; and in four and twenty hours we had only made about &s;ix Leagues. That day we began to &s;ee of tho&s;e Birds which the <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> call <HI>Rabo de Junco,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Rabo de Junco, <HI>a Fowl.</HI></NOTE> and are a kind of Sea-Mews, only they are bigger, and have the Tail all of a piece, and pointed like a Ru&s;h, wherefore they are called <HI>Ru&s;h Tails;</HI> and they keep upon the water as the Sea-Mews do. At one a Clock the Wind &s;lackened, and chopped into the <HI>Ea&s;t,</HI> and we Steered <HI>South</HI> and by <HI>Ea&s;t.</HI> About four a Clock we tackt, and &s;tood away <HI>North.</HI> About half an hour after five the Wind having veered about to <HI>Ea&s;t, North-Ea&s;t,</HI> we Steered <HI>South-Ea&s;t.</HI> About half an hour after &s;even, the Wind turned <HI>North-Ea&s;t</HI> and by <HI>Ea&s;t.</HI> About ten a Clock it was full <HI>North-Ea&s;t,</HI> and we bore away <HI>Ea&s;t, South-Ea&s;t.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Sunday</HI> morning the &s;even and twentieth of <HI>December,</HI> at five of the Clock, the Wind turned <HI>Ea&s;t</HI> and by <HI>North,</HI> and we Steered our Cour&s;e <HI>South-Ea&s;t</HI> and by <HI>South.</HI> About nine a Clock we bore away <HI>South-Ea&s;t,</HI> becau&s;e the Wind was at <HI>Ea&s;t, North-Ea&s;t,</HI> and blew pretty fre&s;h. Our Officers took an Ob&s;ervation at noon, and were again of different opinions; the Captain had two and twenty degrees fifty two minutes; the Mate twenty three, and the Gunner three and twenty degrees and two minutes; and in twenty four hours, we had made fourteen Leagues. In the Evening a flying Fi&s;h leaped into our Ship. The Wind fre&s;hened &s;o much in the night-time that we were obliged to furl our Top Sails.</P>
<P><HI>Monday</HI> noon the twenty eighth of <HI>December,</HI> the Captain found out by his Ob|&s;ervation, that we were in the Latitude of twenty two degrees eight minutes, and the Gunner, in twenty two degrees eighteen minutes; in four and twenty hours we had made fourteen Leagues. That day we &s;aw a great many Weeds

This Herb grows upon the Rocks in the Sea, and being torn off by &s;torm, it floats upon the water, till it be ca&s;t a &s;hoar. About two in the afternoon the Wind &s;lackened much, and therefore we &s;pread our Main-Top, and Fore-Top-Sails, the Sea (which had been very high before,) growing calm and &s;mooth within a few hours.</P>

<P>Next morning we &s;aw two Snakes upon the water,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Snakes upon the water are a &s;ign of the nearne&s;s of Land.</NOTE> which occa&s;ioned great joy in the Ship; for when they begin to &s;ee Snakes, it is an infallible mark that they are not above forty Leagues off the Land of the <HI>Indies;</HI> wherefore one may boldly come to &s;ounding; and indeed, when at nine a Clock we heaved out the Lead, we found fifty three Fathom water. At noon by the Gunners Ob&s;ervation we were in one and twenty degrees, thirty three minutes Latitude, having in the la&s;t twenty four hours run five and twenty Leagues and a half; we &s;ounded a &s;econd time, and had forty Fathom water; whereupon we &s;tood away <HI>South-Ea&s;t</HI> and by <HI>Ea&s;t,</HI> that we might not run upon the Land of <HI>Diu,</HI> where we had nothing to do, and which is the Rendez-vous of the <HI>Malabar</HI> Cor&s;airs, and the <HI>Zinganes.</HI> Half an hour after five in the evening, we had but thirty five Fathom water, and then we &s;aw upon the water a great many little yellow Snakes, a Foot long, and as big as ones little Finger, which made us know that we were near the Coa&s;t of <HI>Diu,</HI> along which the Snakes are &s;mall; for from thence forwards along the Coa&s;t of the <HI>Indies</HI> they are big. That we might not then run within Land, we &s;tood away <HI>South-Ea&s;t.</HI> About &s;ix a Clock we began to &s;ee &s;ome Excrements of the Sea, which the <HI>Proven&s;als</HI> call <HI>Carna&s;&s;e,</HI> the Italians, <HI>Potta-Marina,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Carna&s;&s;e, <HI>or</HI> Potta Marina, <HI>or</HI> Alfareca.</NOTE> and the <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> call <HI>Alfareca;</HI> I fancy that I have &s;een the figure and de&s;cription of them, by the name of <HI>Potta-Marina,</HI> in a Treati&s;e of <HI>Fabius Columna, de Con|chis,</HI> which is at the end of the Treati&s;e <HI>de Plantis</HI> of the &s;ame Author. Our Ships Company told me it was like a frothy Fle&s;h, which the Fi&s;h eat, and when it touches a Mans Fle&s;h, it &s;ticks to it like Glew, and puts him to hot &s;tinging pains. This puts me in mind, that heretofore being at <HI>Calais,</HI> a Gentleman of Honour told me, that in the Sea of <HI>Calais,</HI> there were &s;ome certain Sea-Excre|ments, which &s;tung and occa&s;ioned &s;uch burning pains when they touched a Mans Fle&s;h; that he had &s;een &s;ome Soldiers of the Gari&s;on run about the &s;treets roaring and crying out like Mad-men, through the violence of the pain they &s;uffered by the&s;e Excrements, which had touched their Fle&s;h, when they wa&s;hed them|&s;elves in the Harbour; and that this pain la&s;ted two or three days. In all pro|bability tho&s;e Excrements he &s;poke to me of, were <HI>Carna&s;&s;es.</HI> (If the Tran&s;latour be not mi&s;taken, the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> call that Excrement a <HI>Carvel.</HI>) We &s;aw &s;o great a quantity of them all the evening, that &s;ometimes they made the Sea look all white, and they lay as it were in veins; &s;o that to judge by the &s;ight, one would have taken them for great Banks of Sand, but of a very white Sand, or el&s;e for Rivers of Milk; and certainly a Man that had never &s;een them, nor been told what they were, would think him&s;elf to be upon a Bank of Sand. No &s;ooner was one of the&s;e veins pa&s;t, but we &s;aw another a coming, and each of them was above five hundred paces in length, and proportionably broad. Tho&s;e that floated along the Ships &s;ide, lookt like &s;o many very clear Stars, and at fir&s;t I took them for &s;parks that are many times &s;een to fla&s;h out of the Sea, when the water is very rough, but having ob&s;erved that they lo&s;t not their &s;plendour, as commonly that
<PB N="196" REF="269">
&s;ort of &s;parks does, which di&s;appear as &s;oon as they are &s;een, I took notice of them to the Captain and the re&s;t that were upon the Quarter Deck, and asked them what they were; they all told me they were <HI>Carna&s;&s;es;</HI> and they knew by that, that we were near Land: for the&s;e Excrements are not commonly &s;een but very near the &s;hoar, and are the fore runners of a Gale of Wind: but when the Captain con&s;idered them, and &s;aw them coming in &s;o great a quantity, he ac|knowledged to me, that he had never &s;een &s;o many of them together; and about eight a Clock the Lead being heaved out, we found thirty Fathom wa|ter. After eight a Clock we &s;aw no more <HI>Carna&s;&s;es.</HI> A little after eight the Wind blew very fre&s;h, which made us take in the Main-Top-Sail. At the &s;ame time we perceived to the Windward at <HI>Ea&s;t, North-Ea&s;t,</HI> a great light which all pre&s;ently knew to be &s;ome great fire a &s;hoar, and we &s;aw many &s;uch until midnight, which confirmed us in the opinion that we were very near the Land of <HI>Diu.</HI> Wherefore we Steered on our Cour&s;e <HI>South-Ea&s;t,</HI> bearing rather to <HI>South</HI> than <HI>Ea&s;t.</HI> About eleven a Clock the Wind &s;lackened much.</P>
<P><HI>Thur&s;day</HI> the la&s;t day of the year one thou&s;and &s;ix hundred &s;ixty five, about three a Clock in the morning, the Wind turned <HI>North-Ea&s;t,</HI> and we &s;till Steered our Cour&s;e <HI>South-Ea&s;t.</HI> About break of day we made to the Leeward, <HI>South</HI> of us, a great Ship, with all Sails abroad, even their Top-Gallant-Sails, though it was no good weather for carrying &s;uch Sails; which made us conclude it was the <HI>Ma&s;ulipatan,</HI> which put out from <HI>Congo,</HI> the &s;ame day that we did in the morning, and which we thought had been at <HI>Comoron.</HI> In all appearance he took our Ship for an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> man, for the Captain of the <HI>Ma&s;ulipatan</HI> was a <HI>Hollander,</HI> and therefore he had put out his Top-Gallant-Sails to run for it; and the truth is, he made &s;o good way, that in an hours time he was got almo&s;t out of fight. Half an hour after &s;ix, we ca&s;t out the Lead, and had thirty five Fathom water. According to the Gunners Ob&s;ervation at noon, we were in twenty degrees forty minutes Latitude, and in four and twenty hours time we had made &s;even and twenty Leagues and a half. We were then becalmed, and half an hour after five, we had thirty three Fathom water. At eight of the Clock at night we had a &s;mall Gale from <HI>North-Ea&s;t,</HI> which made us Steer away <HI>Ea&s;t, South-Ea&s;t.</HI> At midnight having &s;ounded we found &s;till thirty three Fathom water.</P>
<P><HI>Friday</HI> New-years-day one thou&s;and &s;ix hundred &s;ixty and &s;ix, at five a Clock in the morning, we had twenty &s;ix Fathom water. At break of day we made to the Leeward, <HI>South, South-Ea&s;t</HI> of us, the &s;ame Ship which we &s;aw the day before, but &s;omewhat nearer to us. We al&s;o made Land, which was known to be the Point of main Land,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Point of <HI>Diu.</HI> The I&s;le of <HI>Diu,</HI> belonging to the <HI>Portu|gue&s;e, Alamba|ter.</HI></NOTE> called the Point of <HI>Diu,</HI> and immediately after we made the I&s;land, which bears the &s;ame name, and is near the main Land of the Country of <HI>Cambaya.</HI> This I&s;land was anciently called, (I think,) <HI>Alambater,</HI> lyes in the Latitude of twenty degrees forty minutes, or one and twenty degrees: the <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> are ma&s;ters of it, and have a Town there of the &s;ame name with the I&s;land, and a Fort which is thought to be impregnable, being &s;ur|rounded with two Ditches, filled with the water of the Sea, and the fir&s;t big enough to admit of Ships; being be&s;ides defended by &s;everal &s;tone-Ba&s;tions, built very high upon a Rock; which are mounted with many great Guns that play on all Hands; &s;o that it will be no ea&s;ie task to take it, unle&s;s being un|provided of Victuals an Enemy might attempt to &s;tarve it: it hath no water but Ci&s;tern-water, yet every Hou&s;e has its Ci&s;tern. There is a good Port in <HI>Diu,</HI> and heretofore all the Trade of the <HI>Indies</HI> was managed there, and at <HI>Chaoul,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Chaoul</HI> be|longing to the <HI>Portugue&s;e.</HI></NOTE> which is another place belonging to the <HI>Portugue&s;e;</HI> but the <HI>Dutch</HI> &s;o ordered matters, that it was wholly removed to <HI>Surrat,</HI> where it is at pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>About &s;even a Clock we found by ob&s;erving the Land, that we had made eight Leagues &s;ince the day before at noon; for you mu&s;t know that &s;o &s;oon as they make Land, they heave the Log no more, to know the Ships running, becau&s;e it is well enough known by the Land. At eight a Clock the Wind turned <HI>Ea&s;t</HI>
<PB N="197" REF="269">
and by <HI>North,</HI> and we &s;tood away <HI>South-Ea&s;t</HI> and by <HI>South.</HI> About eleven a Clock, it turned <HI>Ea&s;t, South-Ea&s;t,</HI> and we Steered away <HI>South.</HI> That day we took no Ob&s;ervation, becau&s;e the Land interpo&s;ed betwixt us and the Horizon; neverthele&s;s we lo&s;t &s;ight of it immediately after noon, and about &s;ix a Clock we tackt about, and &s;tood <HI>North-Ea&s;t</HI> and by <HI>Ea&s;t.</HI> About &s;even a Clock we tackt again. About eight a Clock we were becalmed. Half an hour after nine, we tackt again a third time; and at ten a Clock having ca&s;t the Lead, we had thirty eight Fathom water. About eleven a Clock we had a good Wind at <HI>North, North-Ea&s;t,</HI> which made us bear away <HI>Ea&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>Next day the &s;econd of <HI>January</HI> about five a Clock in the morning, the Wind having veered about to <HI>North-Ea&s;t,</HI> we Steered our Cour&s;e <HI>Ea&s;t, South Ea&s;t.</HI> At break of day having furled our Main-Top-Sail, we put out our Colours, and waited for the <HI>Ma&s;ulipatan,</HI> which was clo&s;e up with us; he pre&s;ently al&s;o &s;hewed his Colours, and within a quarter of an hour after, &s;heered a long on head of us; we hailed one another, but could have no di&s;cour&s;e together, becau&s;e he had &s;tood too much on head; and in a trice fell off from us. This was the <HI>Hollan|ders</HI> fault, for he was vexed that Ma&s;ter <HI>Manuel Mendez</HI> would not Sail with him, though he had invited him; and be&s;ides, he was angry that we &s;hould have come up with him; which was the rea&s;on he would have no Conver&s;ation with us; though ever &s;ince the day before he might many times have born up near enough to have Di&s;cour&s;ed with us, when we were upon our tacks. Half an hour after &s;ix we &s;ounded, and found &s;ix and twenty Fathom water. About &s;even a Clock the Wind came in to <HI>Ea&s;t, North-Ea&s;t;</HI> and we Steered <HI>South-Ea&s;t.</HI> About eight a Clock it blew much fre&s;her from <HI>Ea&s;t</HI> and by <HI>North;</HI> which convincing us that we were off of the mouth of the Bay of <HI>Cambaya,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The mouth of the Bay of <HI>Cambaya.</HI></NOTE> we &s;teered away <HI>South-Ea&s;t</HI> and by <HI>South;</HI> and about nine a Clock, the Wind turning due <HI>Ea&s;t,</HI> we &s;tood away <HI>South, South Ea&s;t.</HI> We could have no Ob|&s;ervation that day, becau&s;e of the motion of the Ship, and mu&s;t re&s;t &s;atisfied to know that from noon to noon, we had made fifteen Leagues. About five a Clock the Captain of the <HI>Mu&s;ulipatan</HI> being in a better humour, bore up with us, and after the <HI>Selam,</HI> and three or four Cups drunk to our good Voyage, he asked us if we would go in Con&s;ort, and we agreed to it. A|bout &s;ix a Clock the Wind cea&s;ed, and left us becalmed. About half an hour after ten we had a &s;mall Gale from <HI>North, North Ea&s;t,</HI> which made us bear away <HI>Ea&s;t.</HI> At midnight the Wind veering in to <HI>North-Ea&s;t,</HI> we &s;teered away <HI>Ea&s;t, South-Ea&s;t.</HI> Then we heaved the Lead, and found forty Fathom water.</P>
<P><HI>Sunday</HI> morning the third of <HI>January</HI> we perceived &s;everal peices of Wood floating upon the water, and &s;ome Snakes bigger than ones Thumb, four or five Foot long, and of a blacki&s;h colour; and about noon we &s;aw the Sea water look whiti&s;h; the&s;e were &s;o many &s;igns that we were near the <HI>Indian</HI> &s;hoar. At noon the Gunner took an Ob&s;ervation, but how right, I cannot tell, becau&s;e of the Ships great Travel; and he found that we were in the La|titude of nineteen degrees, fifty four minutes, but we could not tell how much we had run, for in twenty four hours time, we had not heaved the Log, knowing that we were near Land: we only ca&s;t the Lead and found thirty three Fathom water; having ca&s;t it out again at three a Clock in the afternoon, we had no more but thirty Fathom. About five a Clock the Wind turned <HI>Ea&s;t, North Ea&s;t,</HI> and we &s;tood away <HI>South-Ea&s;t.</HI> Half an hour after five, we had again thirty three Fathom water. About eight a Clock the Wind was got into <HI>Ea&s;t</HI> and by <HI>North,</HI> and we &s;teered <HI>South-Ea&s;t</HI> and by <HI>South;</HI> and had &s;till thirty three Fathom water. About half an hour after ten, the Wind turned <HI>North</HI> and by <HI>Ea&s;t,</HI> a brisk Gale, and we bore away <HI>Ea&s;t</HI> and by <HI>North.</HI> At midnight we had twenty five Fathom water.</P>
<P><HI>Monday</HI> the fourth of <HI>January,</HI> half an hour after five in the morning, we had the Wind at <HI>North-Ea&s;t,</HI> and &s;teered away <HI>Ea&s;t, South-Ea&s;t;</HI> but this hot Wind blew &s;o fre&s;h, that we were obliged to furl our Main-Top-Sail; and
<PB N="198" REF="270">
then we had twenty five Fathom water. A <HI>North-Ea&s;t</HI> Wind blows commonly on that Coa&s;t all the Moon of <HI>December,</HI> and the beginning of the Moon of <HI>January,</HI> and after it comes the <HI>North-We&s;t</HI> Wind. About eleven a Clock the Wind flackning a little, we unfurled our Main-Top-Sail again. At noon the Gunner found that we were in the Latitude of nineteen degrees twenty four minutes, and having ca&s;t the Lead, we had two and twenty Fathom water, and at five a Clock the &s;ame. Half an hour after five, the Wind turning <HI>North, North-Ea&s;t,</HI> we &s;teered away <HI>Ea&s;t.</HI> At nine a Clock we had only twenty Fathom water; and at midnight but eighteen.</P>
<P><HI>Tue&s;day</HI> the fifth of <HI>January</HI> after midnight, the Wind was at <HI>North-Ea&s;t</HI> and by <HI>Ea&s;t,</HI> but a very ea&s;ie Gale, and we bore away <HI>South-Ea&s;t</HI> and by <HI>Ea&s;t.</HI> At five a Clock in the morning we had but four Fathom water. At break of day we made the Land of <HI>Ba&s;&s;aim</HI> on Head, which was very near us, and we had made it the day before, if it had not been hazy upon the Land.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ba&s;&s;aim.</NOTE><HI>Ba&s;&s;aim</HI> is a Town held by the <HI>Portugue&s;e,</HI> lying about the nineteenth de|gree and a half of <HI>North</HI> Latitude.

A|bout three a Clock we had a Gale from <HI>We&s;t,</HI> when we lea&s;t expected it; for it &s;eldom blows on that Coa&s;t: that was the rea&s;on we came not to an An|chor, though it began to Ebb, and we &s;tood away <HI>North</HI> and by <HI>Ea&s;t.</HI> Half an hour after five, we had twenty Fathom water, and at &s;ix a Clock we were becalmed.

<P><PB N="199" REF="270">Next morning about nine a Clock, we weighed, though it was &s;till low water, only we had a Gale from <HI>South-Ea&s;t;</HI> we &s;teered <HI>Ea&s;t, North-Ea&s;t,</HI> that we might &s;tand in to &s;hoar, and about half an hour after eleven we came to an Anchor, a League off of the Town of <HI>Daman,</HI> and <HI>We&s;tward</HI> from it. I did not go a &s;hoar, becau&s;e the Captain told me, that I could not &s;tay there above an hour or two, having ordered the Boat that carried a &s;hoar Ma&s;ter <HI>Manuel Mendez,</HI> to return immediately, and being re&s;olved &s;o &s;oon as he had unloaded his Goods to weigh Anchor, and wait for no body: I did not think going a &s;hoar to be worth the pains of running the risk of being taken; for there are <HI>Malabar</HI> Barks commonly upon the &s;cout, e&s;pecially in the evening, skulking behind &s;ome Points of Land, and when they perceive any &s;mall Ve&s;&s;el, make up to it and carry it away.</P>
<P><HI>Daman</HI> is a Town belonging to the <HI>Portugue&s;e,</HI> who have made it very &s;trong,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Daman.</HI> Latitude of <HI>Daman.</HI></NOTE> and have a good Fort in it.

This Town has no other Harbour but a little Canal or Cut which is full at high water, and remains dry when the Tide is out; &s;mall Barks come into it, but Ships ride out in the Road. Ours &s;tayed there a little more than four and twenty hours, for the Boats that were to come for the Goods of Ma&s;ter <HI>Manuel Mendez,</HI> came not a Board of us till the next day, which was <HI>Saturday;</HI> it was noon before we had loaded them, and it behoved us afterwards to &s;tay till two a Clock for our Boat, though we had fired a Gun in the morning as a &s;ignal for them to put off; but the Sea-men being got drunk, made never the more ha&s;te for that: we did not weigh Anchor then, till three a Clock in the afternoon, and we &s;tood away <HI>North,</HI> the Wind being then at <HI>We&s;t, North-We&s;t.</HI> A|bout &s;even a Clock we were forced to come to an Anchor, becau&s;e the Wind was down, and the Tide of Ebb made us lo&s;e way.

<P>Next day being <HI>Sunday</HI> the tenth of <HI>January,</HI> by break of day we were got within a Cannon &s;hot of Land, which was to our Starboard, and to the Larboard we &s;aw two great Ships at Anchor: they were pre&s;ently known to be Ships belonging to the King of <HI>Mogul,</HI> which Trade to <HI>Moca,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ships of the King of <HI>Mo|gul.</HI></NOTE> whither they carry at every Voyage above two Millions.

At length, half an hour after ten, we came to an Anchor at the Bar of <HI>Surrat,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Bar of <HI>Surrat.</HI></NOTE> in &s;ix Fathom and a half water; and pre&s;ently a Cu&s;tom-Hou&s;e Waiter came on Board of us, being there accidentally; for commonly they come not, till after the Captain be gone a &s;hoar.</P>
<P>Next day <HI>Monday</HI> the eleventh of <HI>January,</HI> &s;everal of the Cu&s;tom-Hou&s;e Boats came on Board of us, to take in all the Pa&s;&s;engers and their Goods: we went down into them, and they put off from the Ship about half an hour after two: at fir&s;t we made towards &s;hoar apace, the Wind being good; but it being low water, an hour after we &s;tuck a ground, and it behoved us to &s;tay for Flood to get off again, which was not till half an hour after three, when we weighed again the Anchor which we had dropped. We went on then, with the Tide, for the Wind was contrary; and within half an hour after, ran a ground again; where we were another half hour before we could get off: having afterwards advanced a little farther, we &s;aw a &s;mall I&s;le to our Right Hand, and from thence the Channel grows narrower and narrower.

<HEAD>CHAP. I.</HEAD>
<P>I Set out from <HI>Bal&s;ora</HI> in the Ship <HI>Hopewel,</HI> the &s;ixth of <HI>Novem|ber,</HI> 1665. &s;ix Days before the beginning of the <HI>Mon&s;on,</HI> and the tenth of <HI>January</HI> 1666, arrived at the Bar of <HI>Surrat;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Bar of <HI>Surrat.</HI></NOTE> &s;o that I had above two Months Voyage of it. That place which is about &s;ix French Leagues from <HI>Surrat,</HI> is called, the Bar, becau&s;e of the ma|ny Sand-banks that hinder great Ships from entring the River, be|fore they be unloaded; and the proper &s;ea&s;on for Sailing on the Indian-Sea, is called <HI>Mou&s;&s;on</HI> or <HI>Mon&s;on,</HI> by corruption of <HI>Mou&s;&s;em.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Mon&s;on.</NOTE> I have mention'd in the Second Part of my Travels, that that &s;ea&s;on wherein there is a con|&s;tant Trade-Wind upon that Sea, begins commonly at the end of <HI>October;</HI> that it la&s;ts to the end of <HI>April,</HI> and that that is the time to go from <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> to the <HI>Indies,</HI> if one would avoid the Tempe&s;ts.</P>
<P>Next Day, being the Eleventh, about half an hour after two a Clock in the Morning, I went with the re&s;t of the Pa&s;&s;engers into a Boat, and at Eight at Night we arrived before <HI>Surrat,</HI> near to the Cu&s;tom-hou&s;e, where coming to an Anchor, I pa&s;t the Night in the Boat; and next Day, the twelfth of <HI>Jaauary,</HI> about ten of the Clock in the Morning the Cu&s;tom-hou&s;e being open, our Boat upon the &s;ignal given, put in to Land as near
<PB N="2" REF="273">
as it could: From thence we were carried a&s;hore upon Mens backs, who came up to the middle in the Water to take us up, and immediately we were led into a large Court; having cro&s;&s;ed it, we entred into a Hall, where the Cu&s;tomer waited for us, to have us &s;earched.</P>
<P>Vi&s;ited we were; but in &s;o &s;evere and vexatious a manner, that tho' I did expect it, and had prepared my &s;elf for it before hand, yet I had hard|ly patience enough to &s;uffer the Searchers to do what&s;oever they had a mind to,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A &s;trict &s;earch</NOTE> tho' I had nothing about me but my Cloaths; and indeed, it is incredible what caution and circum&s;pection tho&s;e People u&s;e to prevent be|ing cheated. And in this manner they proceed.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Bar is &s;ix Leagues from the Town.</NOTE>So &s;oon as a Ship comes to an Anchor at the <HI>Bar,</HI> the Ma&s;ter is oblig'd to to go a&s;hore in his Boat, and acquaint the Cu&s;tom-hou&s;e with his arrival, and pre&s;ently he is &s;earch'd from Head to Foot, at the &s;ame time a Waiter is &s;ent on board the Ve&s;&s;el, to hinder them from breaking bulk, running any thing a&s;hore, or on board another Ship that hath been already &s;earch|ed; and in the mean time, if they have &s;till time enough, they &s;end off &s;e|veral Barks to bring the Men and Goods a&s;hore to the Cu&s;tom-hou&s;e. The Waiter has for his dues from every Pa&s;&s;enger an <HI>Aba&s;&s;y</HI> which is worth a|bout eighteen Pence;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Aba&s;&s;y</HI> 18 pennce. Half a <HI>Roupie</HI> 15 pence.</NOTE> and the Bark has half a <HI>Roupie</HI> a Head, that is, about fifteen Pence for the pa&s;&s;age. If when the Pa&s;&s;engers come to the Town, the Cu&s;tom-hou&s;e be not as yet &s;hut, they pre&s;ently come a&s;hore; but if it be, they mu&s;t tarry in the Bark: In the mean while it is never open but from ten in the Morning till Noon, and it requires a whole Tide to come from the Bar to the Town, unle&s;s by good luck one have the Wind and Tide with him.</P>
<P>Seeing the re&s;t of the Day and all the following Night are to be &s;pent in the Bark, Waiters are &s;et over it, Who keep con&s;tant Watch to &s;ee that none enter in or go out. When the Cu&s;tom-hou&s;e is opened, and the Pa&s;|&s;engers &s;uffered to come a&s;hore, then double diligence is u&s;ed, and the num|ber of Waiters encrea&s;ed. One Bark advances at a time, and &s;he lands ju&s;t again&s;t the Cu&s;tom-hou&s;e Gate which is upon the Key.</P>
<P>There is a <HI>Kiochk,</HI> or covered Pavillion, where Sentinels are placed to ob&s;erve and view all that goes in or comes out of the Bark; and the Cu|&s;tom-hou&s;e Porters go into the Water, and bring the Men and Goods a|&s;hore upon their Backs.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Pions.</NOTE>In the mean time, there are upon the River-&s;ide, a great number of <HI>Pi|ons,</HI> who are Men ready to be employ'd in any kind of Service, and to be hired by the Day, if one plea&s;es, as the <HI>Staffieri</HI> in <HI>Italy</HI> are. The&s;e <HI>Pions</HI> of the Cu&s;tom-hou&s;e have great Canes in their Hands to keep off the People with, that tho&s;e who come a&s;hore may not have the lea&s;t communication with any body; and for the greater &s;ecurity, they draw up in both &s;ides, and make a Lane for the Pa&s;&s;engers. This is no incon&s;iderable &s;ervice to new comers, for if any body came near them, they would certainly be ac|cu&s;ed of &s;muggling Goods; and then be&s;ides the Caning they would be ex|pos'd to, they mu&s;t al&s;o expect to be roundly fined, and &s;ome have been fined in above Ten thou&s;and Livres, though, in reality they had not &s;aved a bit of Goods. And, indeed, they who have a mind to conceal any thing, and defraud the Cu&s;tom-hou&s;e, order their Affairs more truly: They &s;tay not till they come to <HI>Surrat,</HI> there to beg the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of their Friends. I have known &s;ome bring in a great many precious Stones, and other rich Jewels, which the Officers of the Cu&s;tom-hou&s;e never &s;aw, nor got one Far|thing by, becau&s;e the Dutch Commander was their Friend, and had a&s;&s;i&s;t|ed them.</P>
<P>From that Court of the Cu&s;tom-hou&s;e, one is led into the Hall, where the chief Cu&s;tomer &s;its on his <HI>Divan,</HI> after the manner of the Orientals, and his Clerks underneath him. I &s;hall &s;ay nothing of the <HI>Indian Divans</HI> in this place, becau&s;e they are like to tho&s;e of <HI>Turky</HI> and <HI>Per&s;ia.</HI> The Pa&s;|&s;engers enter into that place one after another, and but one at a time. Pre|&s;ently they write down in a Regi&s;ter the name of him that enters, and then he is &s;earched. He mu&s;t take off his Cap or Turban, his Girdle, Shoes, Stockins, and all the re&s;t of his Cloaths, if the Searchers think fit.
<PB N="3" REF="273">
They feel his Body all over; and handle every the lea&s;t inch of &s;tuff a|bout him with all exactne&s;s if they perceive any thing hard in it, they immediately rip it up, and all that can be done, is to &s;uffer patiently. That &s;earch is long, and takes up above a quarter of an Hour for every Per&s;on &s;everally, though at that time they only examine what they have a|bout them. If they find Gold or Silver, they take two and a half <HI>per cent.</HI> and give back the re&s;t; then the partie is let go, but mu&s;t leave his Goods and Baggage. He that hath been &s;earched marches out by the Wicket of a Gate that opens into the Street, where there is a Guard that &s;uffers him not to pa&s;s without Orders from the Cu&s;tomer.</P>
<P>Next Day, all who have left their Goods or Baggage, fail not to come to the &s;ame Gate. The Cu&s;tomer comes al&s;o about ten of the Clock in the Morning, and having con&s;idered whether the Seal which the Day before he put upon two great Padlocks that hold the great Gate and Wicket &s;hut, be whole or not, he cau&s;es both to be opened. He and his Men go in; the Gate is &s;hut again, and the Wicket only left open. So all wait with|out till they be called in; and it was my good fortune to be introduc'd with the fir&s;t.</P>
<P>They pre&s;ently bid me own what belong'd to me, and my Cloakbags be|ing brought into the middle of the Hall, they were opened and emptied; every thing was examined one after another: Though I had no Merchant-goods, yet all was &s;earched; my Quilt was ript up, they undid the Pom|mel of one of my Pi&s;tols, with Pegs of Iron felt in the Hol&s;ters; and the Clerks at length, being &s;atisfied with the view of my things, I was let go, and pay'd only Cu&s;tom for my Money. It was no &s;mall fortune for me to be &s;o &s;oon di&s;patched; for Men may wait &s;ometimes a Month before they can get out their Baggage, and e&s;pecially they who have Merchants-goods, for which at that Cu&s;tom-hou&s;e they pay Four in the Hundred,<NOTE PLACE="marg">What is pay'd at the Cu&s;tom-hou&s;e.</NOTE> if they be Chri&s;tians, and Five in the Hundred if they be <HI>Banians.</HI></P>

<P>THe <HI>Great Mogul</HI> de&s;cends in direct line from <HI>Tamerlan,</HI> who&s;e Succe&s;&s;ours that &s;etled in the Indies, took to them&s;elves the Name of <HI>Moguls,</HI> that they might be di&s;tingui&s;hed from tho&s;e to whom that Prince left <HI>Zagatay, Cora&s;&s;an, Per&s;ia,</HI> and other Countries to be Governed after him. They thought that that Name might contribute much to the Glory of their Fa|mily, becau&s;e by taking it they would more ea&s;ily per&s;wade Men, that they are of the Race of <HI>Ginguis Can,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ginguis Can.</NOTE> the Fir&s;t Emperour of the Ancient Moguls, who had carried it above Twelve Ages before them, and who un|der that Title began the Greate&s;t and mo&s;t Powerful Empire in the World.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Mogul.</NOTE><HI>Mogul</HI> was heretofore the Name of a mighty People, who inhabited a va&s;t Country at the extremity of Ea&s;t <HI>Tartary,</HI> towards the North, which &s;ome have called <HI>Mogul,</HI> others <HI>Mongul</HI> and <HI>Mongal,</HI> and others <HI>Moguli&s;tan,</HI> where <HI>Ginguis Can</HI> was Born. That Emperour or Great <HI>Chan,</HI> reduced it wholly under his Obedience, before he undertook the Conque&s;t of the re&s;t of <HI>A&s;ia;</HI> and his Subjects, as well as he, were called <HI>Moguls.</HI> This gave occa&s;ion to tho&s;e of <HI>India,</HI> to take the &s;ame Name, thereby to &s;ignifie that they are de|&s;cended from him.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Tamerlan.</NOTE>As for the Genealogy of <HI>Tamerlan,</HI> it mu&s;t be examined &s;ome where el&s;e than in the relation of Travels, if one would know the truth of it, becau&s;e of the diver&s;ity of opinions that are to be found among&s;t the Oriental wri|ters upon that &s;ubject.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Gazna.</NOTE><HI>Tamerlan</HI> had already given great jealou&s;ie to the Indians, by Conquering the Province of <HI>Gazna,</HI> which had been &s;ometimes in their dependance, though lying a great deal on this &s;ide of the <HI>Indies,</HI> and which in his own lifetime was Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by <HI>Pir Muhemmed,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Pir-Muhem|med.

<P>This young Prince made him&s;elf Ma&s;ter of <HI>Candahar, Caboul,</HI> and many other Towns, the greate&s;t part whereof he lo&s;t &s;ometime after by the Valour of <HI>Chaalem</HI> King of <HI>Bengale</HI> and <HI>Deran;</HI> but he recovered them in proce&s;s of time by the means of <HI>Tahmas</HI> Kings of <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> who&s;e Si&s;ter he Married, and having carried his Conque&s;t farther on, he made <HI>Delby</HI> the Capital of his Kingdom.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ecbar.</NOTE>His Son <HI>Ecbar</HI> Succeded him; and having joyned a great many Provinces of <HI>Judo&s;tan</HI> to tho&s;e which his Father left him, died in the Year 1604.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Gehanguir.</NOTE><HI>Selim</HI> his Elde&s;t Son, was immediately Crowned by the Name of <HI>Gehan|guir;</HI> and having Reigned Three and twenty Years, and enlarged the Con|que&s;t, he died in the Year 1627.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="274">After his death, his Grand&s;on <HI>Boulloquoy</HI> Reigned about Three Months,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Bulloquoy.</NOTE> but he was &s;trangled by Order of <HI>Sultan Corom,</HI> a Rebel Son of <HI>Gehanguir,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Corom.</NOTE> who having made &s;ure of the Empire,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chagehan.</NOTE> took to him&s;elf the Name of <HI>Cha|gehan</HI> in the Year 1628.</P>
<P>Seeing Blood and Rebellion rai&s;ed him to the Throne, he had experi|ence of the &s;ame di&s;orders among&s;t his Children, which he had cau&s;ed to his Father; for through their jealou&s;ie his Empire was almo&s;t always in confu&s;ion,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Auranzeb.</NOTE> and at length fell into the hands of <HI>Auranzeb</HI> the Third of his Four Sons, who Reigns at pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>In mounting to the Throne, this Prince imitated the crimes of his Fa|ther; for he put to death <HI>Dara</HI> his Elde&s;t Brother, impri&s;oned <HI>Mourad</HI> his other Brother who confided in him, and clapt up his own Father in Pri&s;on,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The death of <HI>Chagehan.</HI></NOTE> who died Five or Six Years after, about the end of the Year 1666.</P>
<P>The <HI>Great Mogul</HI> is certainly a mo&s;t Powerful Prince,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Power of the <HI>Mogul.</HI></NOTE> as we may Judge by his Riches, Armies, and the number of People that are within the extent of his Empire.

The <HI>Canon Name,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Regi&s;tred Forces of the <HI>Mogul.</HI></NOTE> which is a Regi&s;ter containing a Li&s;t of his Forces, makes it appear, that that Prince entertains Three hundred thou&s;and Hor&s;e, of which betwixt Thirty and Thirty five thou&s;and, with ten thou&s;and Foot are for a Guard to his Per|&s;on both in time of Peace and War, and are commonly quartered in tho&s;e places where he keeps his Court. This Empire extends from Ea&s;t to We&s;t above Four hundred Leagues, and from North to South above Five hun|dred, and that va&s;t &s;pace, (excepting &s;ome Mountains and De&s;erts,) is &s;o full of Towns, Ca&s;tles, Burroughs and Villages, and by con&s;equence of Inhabitants who till the Land, or emprove it by manufactures, and the commerce which that Country affords, that it is ea&s;ie to judge of the Power of the King who is Ma&s;ter thereof.</P>
<P>The true bounds of his Empire are to the We&s;t,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The bounds of <HI>Moguli&s;tan.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Macran</HI> or <HI>Sinde</HI> and <HI>Candahar;</HI> to the Ea&s;t, it reaches beyond the <HI>Ganges;</HI> to the South it is li|mited by <HI>Decan,</HI> the great Sea and the Gulf of <HI>Bengale;</HI> and to the North by the <HI>Tartars.</HI> The exageration of many Travellers, concerning the ex|tent of the Countries of this great King of the <HI>Indies,</HI> was the cau&s;e that I made it my bu&s;ine&s;s to con&s;ult the mo&s;t knowing Men, that I might learn what they thought of the greatne&s;s of it, and what now I write is their Opinion.</P>
<P>They affirm not as &s;ome do, that when the <HI>Mogul</HI> makes War,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The true For|ces of the <HI>Mo|gul.</HI></NOTE> he &s;ends Three hundred thou&s;and Hor&s;e into the field. They &s;ay, indeed, that he pays &s;o many; but &s;eeing the chief Revenues, or to &s;ay better, the rewards of the Great Men, con&s;i&s;t particularly in the pay which they have for more or fewer Troopers, it is certain that they hardly keep on Foot one half of the Men they are appointed to have; &s;o that when the Great <HI>Mogul</HI> marches upon any expedition of War, his Army exceeds not an Hundred and fifty thou&s;and Hor&s;e, with very few Foot, though he have betwixt Three and four hundred thou&s;and Mouths in the Army.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, I was informed by any Indian who pretends to know the Map of his Country, that they reckon no more but twenty Provinces within the extent of <HI>Moguli&s;tan</HI> in the Indies, and that they who have reckoned more, have not been well informed of their number, &s;ince of one Province they have made two or three.</P>
<P>This Indian had a li&s;t of the Princes Revenues calculated for the twenty Provinces, and I made no doubt of the truth of his Sy&s;tem;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Twenty Pro|vinces or Go|vernments in <HI>Mogulistan.</HI></NOTE> but I had ra|ther call them Governments, and &s;ay that every Government contains &s;e|veral Provinces.

<P>The Hill being high and hard to be mounted, it might be a very ea&s;ie matter to put the fortre&s;s in a condition not to fear any Attack, but at pre|&s;ent it is &s;o much &s;lighted, that there are &s;everal great breaches in the Walls to the Land &s;ide, which no body thinks of repairing.

<P>Going from their Lodgings, one enters by the&s;e high Arches into the <HI>Meidan-Chah,</HI> which &s;ignifies the Kings Square.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Meidan</HI> of <HI>Amedabad.</HI></NOTE> It is a long Square having four hundred Paces in breadth, and &s;even hundred in length, with Trees planted on all &s;ides.

In the mid|dle of the place there is a very high Tree, purpo&s;ely planted for the exer|ci&s;e of tho&s;e who learn to &s;hoot with the Bow, and who with their Ar|rows &s;trive to hit a Ball which for that end is placed on the top of the Tree.</P>
<P>Having viewed the <HI>Meidan,</HI> we entered the Ca&s;tle by a very high Gate,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Ca&s;tle of <HI>Amedabad.</HI></NOTE> which is betwixt two large round Towers about eight fathom high. All the Appartments of it &s;ignifie but little, though the Ca&s;tle be walled about with good Walls of Free&s;tone, and is as &s;pacious as a little Town.</P>

The entry is a large eight-&s;quare Porch arched over like a Dome, where you may find four Gates, and &s;ee a great many Bal|cony's: The&s;e Gates open into the body of the Building, which is a Square of Free&s;tone two Stories high, and varni&s;hed over like Marble, with Chambers on all &s;ides, where Strangers may lodge.</P>

In the middle of the Front of the Temple, there are three great Arches, and at the &s;ides two large &s;quare Gates that open into it, and each Gate is beautified with Pila&s;ters, but without any order of Architecture. On the out&s;ide of each Gate there is a very high Steeple, which hath four lovely Balcony's, from whence the <HI>Muezins</HI> or Beadles of the Mo&s;que, call the People to Prayers. Its chief Dome is pretty enough, and being accompanied with &s;everal little ones, and two <HI>Minarets,</HI> the whole together looks very plea&s;ant; all that pile is &s;upported by forty four Pillars placed two and two, and the Pavement is of Marble.

At each end there is a Stair-ca&s;e two Foot broad to go down to it, with &s;ix Stories or Landings &s;upported by Pila&s;ters eight Foot high: Each Storie hath a Gallerie, or place of four Fathom extent, and the&s;e Gal|leries and Pila&s;ters are of Free&s;tone: Sixteen Pila&s;ters &s;upport each Gallerie, and the Mouths of the Well are about the &s;ame length and breadth that the Galleries are: The Figure of the third Mouth differs from the re&s;t, be|cau&s;e it is an Octogone, and has near it a little turning Stair-ca&s;e that leads down to the Well; the Water of it ri&s;es from a Spring, and it was up to the middle of the fourth Story when I went down, &s;everal little Boys at that time &s;wiming in it from one end to the other among&s;t the Pillars.

The Streets of it are large, and have all Gates at the ends, which are &s;hut in the Night-time: The Hou&s;es are very high, and built of Bricks dried in the Sun, and the Shops are full of Aromatick Perfumes, Spices, Silken and other Stuffs.

The Tides are &s;o &s;wift to the North of the Gulph, that a Man on Hor&s;e-back at full &s;peed, cannot keep pace with the fir&s;t Waves; and this violence of the Sea is one rea&s;on al&s;o why great Ships go but &s;el|dom thither. The Dutch come not there but about the end of <HI>September,</HI> becau&s;e along the Coa&s;t of <HI>India</HI> that looks to <HI>Arabia,</HI> and e&s;pecially in this Gulf of <HI>Cambaye,</HI> it is &s;o bad for Ships in the beginning of this Month, by rea&s;on of a violent We&s;t-wind that blows then, and which is always accom|panied with thick Clouds which they call Elephants, becau&s;e of their &s;hape, that it is almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible to avoid being ca&s;t away.</P>
<P>Having &s;atisfied my curio&s;ity as to what is remarkable in <HI>Cambaye,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ways to return to <HI>Surrat.</HI></NOTE> I took leave of my Friends; and there being &s;everal ways to go from thence to <HI>Surrat,</HI> I advi&s;ed which I had be&s;t to take. One may go by Sea in four and twenty hours,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Almedie.</NOTE> in an <HI>Almadie</HI> which is a kind of Brigantine u&s;ed by the Por|tugue&s;e for Trading along that Coa&s;t: But the&s;e Ve&s;&s;els go not commonly but in the night-time, that they might not be di&s;covered by the <HI>Malabars.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Gulf of <HI>Cambaye</HI> dan|gerous.</NOTE> In the day-time they keep in Harbours, and in the evening the Ma&s;ter goes up to &s;ome height to di&s;cover if there be any <HI>Malabar</HI> Barks at Sea. The <HI>Almadies</HI> Sail &s;o fa&s;t that the <HI>Malabars</HI> cannot come up with them, but they endeavour to &s;urpri&s;e them, and when they di&s;cover any one in a Harbour,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Malabar</HI> Gor|&s;ars.</NOTE> they skulk behind &s;ome Rock, and fall upon it in its pa&s;&s;age. Many of the&s;e <HI>Almadies</HI> are lo&s;t in the Gulf of <HI>Cambaye,</HI> where the Tides are trou|ble&s;ome, and the Banks numerous; and that's one rea&s;on why Men venture not to go to <HI>Surrat</HI> this way by Sea, unle&s;s extraordinary bu&s;ine&s;s pre&s;s them.</P>
<P>There is another way &s;till by Sea, which is to pa&s;s through the bottom of the Gulf in a Chariot, over again&s;t <HI>Cambaye,</HI> at low Water; and one mu&s;t go three Leagues and a half in Water, which then is betwixt two and three foot deep: But I was told that the Waves beat &s;o rudely &s;ometimes again&s;t the Chariot, that it required a great many hands to keep it from falling, and that &s;ome mi&s;chance always happened; which hindred me from undertaking that cour&s;e, though I knew very well that when I was pa&s;t it, I had no more but eight and twenty Leagues to <HI>Surrat.</HI> And there|fore I cho&s;e rather to go by Land, what danger &s;oever there might be of Robbers, as I was a&s;&s;ured there was.</P>
<P>When my Friends found I was re&s;olved to go that way, they advi&s;ed me for my &s;ecurity to take a <HI>Tcheron</HI> with a Woman of his <HI>Ca&s;te</HI> or tribe,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tcheron.</NOTE> to wait upon me till I were out of danger; but I refu&s;ed to do it, and found by the &s;ucce&s;s that I had rea&s;on to do as I did. The&s;e <HI>Tcherons</HI> are a <HI>Ca&s;te</HI> of Gentiles, who are highly e&s;teemed among&s;t the Idolaters: They live, for mo&s;t part at <HI>Baroche, Cambaye,</HI> and <HI>Amedabad:</HI> If one have any of the&s;e with him he thinks him&s;elf &s;afe, becau&s;e the Man acquaints the Robbers they meet, that the Traveller is under his guard, and that if they come near him, he will cut his own Throat, and the Woman threatens them that &s;he'l cut off one of her Brea&s;ts with a Razor which &s;he &s;hews them; and all the Heathen of tho&s;e places look upon it to be a great misfortune, to be the cau&s;e of the death of a <HI>Tcheran,</HI> becau&s;e ever after the guilty per|&s;on is an eye-&s;ore to the whole tribe; he is turned out of it, and for his whole life-time after upbraided with the death of that Gentil. Heretofore
<PB N="14" REF="279">
&s;ome <HI>Tcherons</HI> both Men and Women have killed them&s;elves upon &s;uch oc|ca&s;ions; but that has not been &s;een of a long time, and at pre&s;ent, they &s;ay, they compound with the Robbers for a certain Sum which the Tra|veller gives them, and that many times they divide it with them. The <HI>Banians</HI> make u&s;e of the&s;e People; and I was told that if I would employ them, I might be &s;erved for two <HI>Roupies</HI> a day: Neverthele&s;s I would not do it, as looking upon it to be too low a kind of Protection.</P>
<P>So then I ordered my Coach-man to drive me the &s;ame way I came, and to return to <HI>Souzentra</HI> that I might go to <HI>Surrat</HI> by the ordinary way, though the compa&s;s he fetched made my Journey longer by &s;even Leagues and a half. For all the caution I could u&s;e, my men lo&s;t their way beyond <HI>Petnad,</HI> and we found our &s;elves at the Village of <HI>Bilpar,</HI> the inhabitants wherof who are called <HI>Gratiates,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Gratiates.</NOTE> are for the mo&s;t part all Robbers. I met with one of them towards a little Town named <HI>Selly;</HI> he was a fellow in very bad cloaths, carrying a Sword upon his Shoulder; he called to the Coach-man to &s;top, and a Boy about Nine or Ten years old that was with him, ran before the Oxen: My Men pre&s;ently offered them a <HI>Pecha</HI> which is worth about ten French Deniers, and prayed the little Boy to be gone; but he would not, till the Coach-man growing more ob&s;tinate, obliged the Man to accept of the <HI>Pecha.</HI> The&s;e Blades go &s;ometimes in whole troops, and one of them being &s;atisfied, others come after upon the &s;ame Road, who mu&s;t al&s;o be contented, though they &s;eldom u&s;e violence for fear of offending their <HI>Raja.</HI> I wondered how that <HI>Gratiate</HI> being alone, dur&s;t venture to &s;et upon &s;o many; but the Coach-man told me, that if the lea&s;t injury had been offered to him, he would have given the alarm by knocking with his Fingers upon his Mouth, and that pre&s;ently he would have been a&s;&s;i&s;ted by his Neighbours: In the mean time this &s;mall rancoun|ter convinced me that there was not &s;o great danger upon the Roads, as &s;ome would have made me believe.</P>
<P>We found our way again &s;hortly after: We then cro&s;&s;ed the River of <HI>Mahy,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Mahy</HI> a River. The <HI>Raja</HI> of the <HI>Gratiates</HI> makes good Robberies.</NOTE> and coming out of it I gave half a Roupie to the &s;ame <HI>Gratiates</HI> whom I payed as I went to <HI>Amedabad.</HI> The role belongs to the <HI>Raja</HI> of the Coun|try, who is to an&s;wer for the Robberies committed within his Territories. And the truth is, he is as exact as po&s;&s;ibly he can be to hinder them, and to cau&s;e re&s;titution to be made of what is taken, e&s;pecially if it be Mer|chants Goods, or other things of con&s;equence: And my Coach-man told me, that one day having lo&s;t an Ox, he went to the <HI>Raja</HI> to demand his Ox; The <HI>Raja</HI> &s;ent for tho&s;e who he thought had &s;toln it, and cau&s;ing them to be cudgelled, till one of them confe&s;&s;ing he had it, he obliged him to bring it out, and re&s;tore it to the Coach-man, who was to give him only a <HI>Roapie</HI> for the blows he had received. But the <HI>Raja</HI> of the <HI>Gratiates</HI> do's much more; for if he that comes to complain, have not time to &s;tay till what he hath lo&s;t be found, it is enough if he tell the place of his abode, and he fails not to &s;end it him back by one of his People, though it be eight days Journey off. He is &s;o much a Gentleman, that mo&s;t commonly he &s;ends Pre&s;ents to People of fa&s;hion who pa&s;s by <HI>Bilpar,</HI> and do's them all the good Offices they de&s;ire of him.</P>
<P>Seeing the Caravans that pa&s;s by that place on their way to <HI>Agra,</HI> pay him ten <HI>Roupies</HI> a Man,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Raja</HI> treats the Ca|ravan <HI>gratis.</HI></NOTE> he treats the whole Caravan <HI>gratis,</HI> and &s;ends Pro|vi&s;ions and Victuals into the Camp; which he orders his Cooks to dre&s;s. The&s;e do what they can to plea&s;e the Caravan, and earn &s;ome <HI>Pechas</HI> from them, and they are reckoned the be&s;t Cooks in the Countrey; but in truth, their Ragoes are not at all good: Nor do's their Ma&s;ter forget to &s;end Dancing Girls to divert the Company; and when they are ready to go, he furni&s;hes the Caravan with &s;everal Hor&s;e-men for their &s;ecurity, until they be out of his Juri&s;diction. His Territories comprehend all the Villa|ges from <HI>Cambaye</HI> to <HI>Baroche,</HI> and all his Subjects are called <HI>Gratiates.</HI></P>
<P>Next Day I came to the Town of <HI>Baroche,</HI> and &s;tay'd only a few Hours to refre&s;h my Men and Oxen. The Officers of the Cu&s;tom-hou&s;e asked me at parting, If I had any Merchants-goods, and having an&s;wered them that I had none; they took my word, and u&s;ed me civily: So I cro&s;&s;ed the River at <HI>Oucli&s;&s;er,</HI> from whence next day I went to <HI>Surrat.</HI></P>

Then they come down, and climb not up the Tree again till they perceive that the Pitcher is full, and then they empty the <HI>Tary</HI> into another Pot fa&s;tened to their girdle. That kind of Palm-tree bears no Dates, when they draw <HI>Tary</HI> from it; but when they draw none, it yields wild Dates.</P>
<P>They take another cour&s;e in drawing that Liquor from the <HI>Coco</HI>-tree.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Coco</HI>-tree.</NOTE> They make no hole, but only cut the lower branches to a Foot length. They fa&s;ten Pots to the end of them, and the <HI>Tary</HI> Di&s;tils into the Ve&s;&s;els. Seeing the Operation I have been &s;peaking of is but once a year performed on the&s;e Palm-trees, they who&s;e Trade it is to fell <HI>Tary;</HI> have a prodigious number of the&s;e Trees, and there are a great many Merchants that Farm them.

That which is drawn in the day-time is eager, and mo&s;t commonly made Vinegar of, becau&s;e it ea&s;ily cor|rupts and decays. That kind of Palm, or <HI>Coco</HI>-tree, is fit for many other u&s;es,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Coco.</NOTE> for of its trunk they make Ma&s;ts and Anchors, nay, and the hulks of Ships al&s;o; and of its bark Sails and Cables. The Fruit that &s;prings from its feathered branches, is as big as an ordinary Melon, and contains a very whole&s;ome Juice, which hath the colour and ta&s;te of Whitewine. The Dutch have a great many of the&s;e <HI>Coco</HI>-trees in <HI>Batavia,</HI> which turn to great profit to them. The Revenue alone of tho&s;e which belong to the Compa|ny near the Town, with the impo&s;ition on every Stand of tho&s;e who &s;ell any thing in the Market-place, is &s;ufficient to pay their Gari&s;on: But they are &s;o rigorous in exacting it, that if any one leave his Stand, to take a minutes refre&s;hment in the Rain, or for any other nece&s;&s;ary occa&s;ion, though he immediately come back, yet mu&s;t he pay a &s;econd time if he will challenge the &s;ame Stand.</P>

This Governour meddles not at all in Criminal Affaires; an Officer named <HI>Cotoual</HI> takes cogni&s;ance of them.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Criminal Judge <HI>Cotoual:</HI></NOTE> In <HI>Turky</HI> he is called <HI>Sousba&s;&s;a,</HI> and in <HI>Per&s;ia Deroga.</HI> He orders the Criminals to be pun|i&s;hed in his pre&s;ence, either by Whipping or Cudgelling, and that cor|rection is inflicted many times in his Hou&s;e, and &s;ometimes in the Street at the &s;ame place where they have commited the fault. When he goes a|broad through the Town, he is on Hor&s;e-back, attended by &s;everal Officers on Foot, &s;ome carrying Batons and great Whips, others Lances, Swords, Targets, and Maces of Iron like the great Pe&s;tles of a Morter; but all have a dagger at their &s;ides. Neverthele&s;s neither the Civil nor Criminal Judge can put any one to death. The King re&s;erves that Power to him&s;elf; and therefore when any Man de&s;erves death, a Courier is di&s;patched to know his plea&s;ure, and they fail not to put his Orders in execution, &s;o &s;oon as the Courier is come back.</P>
<P>The <HI>Cotoual</HI> is obliged to go about the Street in the Night-time, to pre|vent di&s;orders; and &s;ets guards in &s;everal places. If he find any Man a|broad in the Streets, he commits him to Pri&s;on, and very rarely does he let him go out again, without being Ba&s;tonadoed or Whipt. Two of the Of|ficers that wait on him, about nine of the Clock beat two little Drums, whil'&s;t a third &s;ounds two or three times a long Copper-Trumpet, which I have de&s;cribed in my Voyage into <HI>Per&s;ia.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The cry of <HI>Caberdar.</HI></NOTE> Then the Officers or Serjeants cry as loud as they can, <HI>Caberdar,</HI> that's to &s;ay, <HI>take heed;</HI> and they who are in the Neighbouring Streets, an&s;wer with another cry, to &s;hew that they are not a&s;leep.

<P>In the mean time the Governour told the <HI>Cotoual,</HI> that he mu&s;t forthwith pay the Money, becau&s;e if the Emperour came to know of the matter, all the fault would be laid at their door, that perhaps they might be &s;erved wor&s;e than to be made pay the Money that had been &s;tollen from <HI>Cogea Minas,</HI> and that therefore they had be&s;t &s;end for the <HI>Armenian,</HI> and learn from him how much he had really lo&s;t.

<P>This thought was &s;ugge&s;ted in <HI>Surrat,</HI> &s;o &s;oon as it was known that there was a De&s;ign in <HI>France</HI> of &s;ending Ships to trade in the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indies;</HI> and the Calumny was ea&s;ily believ'd, becau&s;e one <HI>Lambert Hugo,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Lambert Hugo</HI> a Cor&s;ar.</NOTE> a Dutch|man, who had had French on Board of him, and whom they brought fre&s;h into the Peoples Minds, had been two Years before at <HI>Moca</HI> with French Colours, and a Commi&s;&s;ion from the Duke of <HI>Vendo&s;me</HI> then Ad|miral of <HI>France,</HI> and had taken &s;ome Ve&s;&s;els: But that which offended mo&s;t, was the &s;tory of the Ship that carried the Goods of the Queen of <HI>Vi&s;iapour,</HI> and was &s;tranded about <HI>Socotra;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Queen of <HI>Vi&s;iapour.

It being difficult for the Cor&s;ar to approach the Ship in the place where &s;he lay, he lo&s;t no courage, but patiently expected what might be the i&s;&s;ue of her &s;tranding: His expectation was not in vain; for the Indians want|ing Water for a long time, and finding none where they were, &s;uffered great extremity; and therefore having hid in the Sea what Gold, Silver, and pretious Stones they could, they re&s;olved to have recour&s;e to the Cor|&s;ar him&s;elf to &s;ave their lives, hopeing that he would be &s;atisfied with what remained in the Ship.</P>

<P>There were five little artificial Towers upon the Water-&s;ide full of Fire-lances and Squibs, which were &s;et on fire one after another; but &s;eeing the Indian Squibs make no noi&s;e no more than their Fire-lances, all they did, was to turn violently about, and dart a great many &s;treaks of Fire in|to the Air, &s;ome &s;treight up like Water-works, and others obliquely, re|pre&s;enting the branches of a Tree of Fire: They put fire next to a Ma|chine which &s;eemed to be a blew Tree when it was on fire, becau&s;e there was a great deal of Brim&s;tone in the Fire-work: After that, upon a long Bar of Iron fixed in the ground they placed a great many artificial Wheels, which play'd one after another and &s;pread abundance of Fire: They al&s;o burnt divers Pots full of Powder, from which large flakes of Artificial Lightning glanced up in the Air; and all this while, Squibs and Serpents flew about in va&s;t numbers; and with them many Fire-lances, in which was a great deal of Camphire, that yielded a whiti&s;h dazling flame.</P>

The bottom is paved with large Free-&s;tone, and there are Steps almo&s;t all round in form of an Amphi|theatre, reaching from the brim to the bottom of the Ba&s;on; they are each of them half a Foot high, and are of lovely Free-&s;tone that hath been brought from about <HI>Cambaye;</HI> where there are no Steps there is a &s;loaping de&s;cent to the Ba&s;on; and there are three places made for Bea&s;ts to wa|ter at.</P>
<P>In the middle of this Re&s;ervatory there is a Stone-Building about three Fathom every way, to which they go up by two little Stair-ca&s;es.<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Building in the middle of the <HI>Tanquie.</HI></NOTE> In this place they go to divert them&s;elves, and take the fre&s;h Air; but they mu&s;t go to it in Boat. The great Ba&s;on is filled with Rain-water in the &s;ea&s;on when the Rains fall, for after it hath run through the Fields, where it makes a kind of a great Chanal, over which they have been obliged to make Bridges, it &s;tops in a place enclo&s;ed within Walls, from whence it pa&s;&s;es into the <HI>Tanquie</HI> through three round holes, which are above four Foot Diametre, and hard by there is a kind of Mahometan Chap|pel.</P>
<P>This <HI>Tanquie</HI> was made at the charges of a rich <HI>Banian</HI> named <HI>Gopy,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Gopy.</NOTE> who built it for the publick; and heretofore all the Water that was drank in <HI>Surrat</HI> came from this Re&s;ervatory, for the five Wells which at pre&s;ent &s;upply the whole Town, were not found out till long after it was built. It was begun at the &s;ame time the Ca&s;tle was, and they &s;ay, that the one co&s;t as much as the other. It is certainly a Work worthy of a King, and it may be compared to the faire&s;t that the Romans ever made for publick be|nefit. But &s;eeing the Levantines let all things go to ruine for want of re|pair, it was above &s;ix Foot filled with Earth when I &s;aw it, and in dan|ger &s;ometime or other to be wholly choaked up, if &s;ome Charitable Ba|nian be not at the charge of having it clean&s;ed.</P>
<P>Having viewed that lovely Re&s;ervatory,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Prince&s;&s;es Garden.</NOTE> we went a quarter of a League farther to &s;ee the Prince&s;&s;es Garden, &s;o called, becau&s;e it belongs to the <HI>Great Moguls</HI> Si&s;ter. It is a great Plot of Trees of &s;everal kinds; as <HI>Man|guiers, Palms, Mirabolans, Wars, Mai&s;a-trees,</HI> and many other planted in a &s;treight line.

In the middle of the Garden there is a Building with four Fronts, each whereof hath its Divan, with a Clo&s;et at each corner; and before every one of the&s;e Di|vans there is a &s;quare Ba&s;on full of Water, from whence flow the little Brooks which run through the chief Walks. After all, though that Gar|den be well contriv'd, it is nothing to the gallantry of ours. There is no|thing to be &s;een of our Arbours, Borders of Flowers, nor of the exactne&s;s of their Compartments, and far le&s;s of their Water-works.</P>
<P>About an hundred, or an hundred and fifty Paces from that Garden,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The War-tree.</NOTE> we &s;aw the War-tree in its full extent. It is likewi&s;e called <HI>Ber,</HI> and the Tree of <HI>Banians,</HI> as al&s;o the Tree of Roots, becau&s;e of the facility where|with the branches that bear large Filaments, take Rooting, and by con|&s;equence produce other branches; in&s;omuch that one &s;ingle Tree is &s;uffi|cient to fill a great &s;pot of Ground; and this I &s;peak of, is very large and high, affording a mo&s;t &s;pacious &s;hade. Its circuit is round, and is four&s;core Paces in Diametre, which make above thirthy Fathom. The Branches that had irregularly taken Root, have been &s;o skilfully cut, that at pre&s;ent one may without any trouble walk about every where un|der it.</P>

<P>Whil&s;t we were abroad in the Fields, we con&s;idered the Soyl of <HI>Surrat,</HI> it is of a very brown Earth; and they a&s;&s;ured us, that it was &s;o very rich, that they never dunged it.

They lay their pieces of Canes over the&s;e Fi&s;h, end to end, and from every joint of Cane &s;o interred, their Springs a Sugar-cane, which they reap in their &s;ea&s;on.</P>
<P>The Soyl about <HI>Surrat</HI> is good for Rice al&s;o, and there is a great deal &s;own. <HI>Manguiers</HI> and Palm-trees of all kinds, and other &s;orts of Trees thrive well there, and yield great profit.

The King thinking that his Father kept intelligence with him, cau&s;ed him to be arre&s;ted; and he dying in Pri&s;on, <HI>Sivagy</HI> conceived &s;o great a hatred again&s;t the King, that he u&s;ed all endeavours to be revenged on him. In a very &s;hort time he plundered part of <HI>Vifiapour,</HI> and with the Booty he took made him&s;elf &s;o &s;trong in Men, Arms and Hor&s;es, that he found him&s;elf able enough to &s;eize &s;ome Towns, and to form a little State in &s;pight of the King, who died at that time. The Queen,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Queen Re|gent of <HI>Vifia|pour.</HI></NOTE> who was Regent having other Affairs in hand, did all &s;he could to reduce <HI>Sivagy</HI> to duty; but her endeavours being un&s;ucce&s;sful, &s;he accepted of the Peace he propo|po&s;ed to her, after which &s;he lived in quiet.</P>
<P>In the mean while, the Raja, who could not re&s;t, plundered &s;ome pla|ces belonging to the <HI>Great Mogul;</HI> which obliged that Emperour to &s;end Forces again&s;t him, under the conduct of <HI>Cha&s;ta-Can</HI> his Uncle,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Cha&s;ta-Can</HI> Uncle to the <HI>Mogul.</HI></NOTE> Governour

Ch<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;ta-Can</HI> having far more Forces than <HI>Sivagy</HI> had, vigo|rou&s;ly pur&s;ued him, but the <HI>Raja</HI> having his retreat always in the Moun|tains, and being extreamly cunning, the <HI>Mogul</HI> could make nothing of him.</P>
<P>However that old Captain, at length, thinking that the turbulent Spi|rit of <HI>Sivagy</HI> might make him make &s;ome fal&s;e &s;tep, judged it be&s;t to temporize, and lay a long while upon the Lands of the <HI>Raja.</HI> This Pa|tience of <HI>Cha&s;ta-Can</HI> being very trouble&s;ome to <HI>Sivagy,</HI> he had his recour&s;e to a Stratagem.<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Stratagem of War.</NOTE> He ordered one of his Captains to write to that <HI>Mogul,</HI> and to per&s;wade him that he would come over to the &s;ervice of the <HI>Great Mogul,</HI> and bring with him five hundred Men whom he had under his Command. <HI>Cha&s;ta-Can</HI> having receiv'd the Letters, dur&s;t not tru&s;t them at fir&s;t; but receiving continually more and more, and the Captain giving him &s;uch rea&s;ons for his di&s;content as looked very probable, he &s;ent him word that he might come and bring his Men with him. No &s;ooner was he come into the Camp of the <HI>Moguls,</HI> but he de&s;ired a Pa&s;s-port to go to the King that he might put him&s;elf into his Service: But <HI>Cha&s;ta-Can</HI> thought it enough to put him in hopes of it, and kept him with him.</P>
<P><HI>Sivagy</HI> had ordered him to do what he could to in&s;inuate him&s;elf into the favour of <HI>Cha&s;ta-Can,</HI> and to &s;pare no means that could bring that a|bout, to &s;hew upon all occa&s;ions the greate&s;t rancour and animo&s;ity ima|ginable; and in a particular manner to be the fir&s;t in Action again&s;t him or his Subjects. He fail'd not to obey him: He put all to Fire and Sword in the <HI>Raja</HI>'s Lands, and did much more mi&s;chief than all the re&s;t be&s;ides; which gained him full credit in the Mind of <HI>Cha&s;ta-Can,</HI> who at length made him Captain of his Guards. But he guarded him very ill, for ha|ving one Day &s;ent word to <HI>Sivagy,</HI> that on a certain Night he &s;hould be upon Guard at the General's Tent; the <HI>Raja</HI> came there with his Men, and being introduced by his Captain,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Sivagy</HI> &s;urpri|zes <HI>Cha&s;ta-Can.</HI></NOTE> came to <HI>Cha&s;ta-Can,</HI> who awaking flew to his Arms, and was wounded in the Hand; however he made a &s;hift to e&s;cape, but a Son of his was killed, and <HI>Sivagy</HI> thinking that he had killed the General him&s;elf, gave the &s;ignal to retreat: He marched off with his Captain and all his Hor&s;e in good order. He carried off the Generals Trea&s;ure, and took his Daughter, to whom he rendered all the Honour he could. He commanded his Men under rigorous pains, not to do her the lea&s;t hurt, but on the contrary, to &s;erve her with all re&s;pect; and being inform'd that her Father was alive, he &s;ent him word, That if he would &s;end the Summ which he demanded for her Ran&s;om, he would &s;end him back his Daughter &s;afe and &s;ound; which was punctually per|formed.</P>
<P>He wrote afterwards to <HI>Cha&s;ta-Can</HI> praying him to withdraw, and own|ed that the &s;tratagem that had been practi&s;ed was of his own contrivance; that he hatched a great many others for his ruine, and that if he drew not off out of his Lands,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Cha&s;ta-Can</HI> re|tires for fear of <HI>Sivagy.</HI></NOTE> he &s;hould certainly lo&s;e his Life. <HI>Cha&s;ta-Can</HI> &s;lighted not the Advice: He informed the King, that it was impo&s;&s;ible to force <HI>Sivagy</HI> in the Mountains; that he could not undertake it, unle&s;s he re&s;olved to ruine his Troops; and he received Orders from Court to draw off under pretext of a new Enterprize. <HI>Sivagy,</HI> in the mean time, was re&s;olved to be revenged on the <HI>Mogul</HI> by any means what&s;oever, provided it might be to his advantage; and knowing very well that the Town of <HI>Sur|rat</HI> was full of Riches, he took mea&s;ures how he might plunder it: But that no body might &s;u&s;pect his De&s;ign, he divided the Forces he had into two Camps; and &s;eeing his Territories lie chiefly in the Mountains, upon the Road betwixt <HI>Ba&s;&s;aim</HI> and <HI>Chaoul,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><P><HI>Sivagy</HI>'s fir&s;t Camp towards <HI>Chaoul.</HI></P>
<P>The other to|wards <HI>Ba&s;&s;aim.</HI></P></NOTE> he pitched one Camp towards <HI>Cha|oul,</HI> where he planted one of his Pavillions, and po&s;ted another at the &s;ame time towards <HI>Ba&s;&s;aim;</HI> and having ordered his Commanders not to plunder, but on the contrary, to pay for all they had, he &s;ecretly di&s;|gui&s;ed him&s;elf in the habit of a <HI>Faquir.</HI> Thus he went to di&s;cover the mo&s;t commodious ways that might lead him &s;peedily to <HI>Surrat:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Sivagy</HI> at <HI>Sur|rat</HI> in the ha|bit of a <HI>Faquir.</HI></NOTE> He entred the Town to examine the places of it, and by that means had as much time as he plea&s;ed to view it all over.</P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="286">Being come back to his chief Camp,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Savagy</HI> re|turns to his Camp.</NOTE> he ordered four thou&s;and of his Men to follow him without noi&s;e, and the re&s;t to remain encamped, and to make during his ab&s;ence as much noi&s;e as if all were there, to the end none might &s;u&s;pect the enterpri&s;e he was about,<NOTE PLACE="marg">And comes back to <HI>Surrat</HI> with four thou|&s;and men.</NOTE> but think he was &s;till in one of his Camps. Every thing was put in execution according to his or|ders. His march was &s;ecret enough, though he ha&s;tened it to &s;urpri&s;e <HI>Sur|rat;</HI> and he came and Encamped near <HI>Brampour-gate.</HI> To amu&s;e the Go|vernour who &s;ent to him, he demanded guides under pretence of marching to another place; but the Governour without &s;ending him any An&s;wer, retired into the Fort with what he had of the greate&s;t value, and &s;ent for a&s;&s;i&s;tance on all hands.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Plunder+ing of <HI>Surrat.</HI></NOTE> Mo&s;t of the Inhabitants in con&s;ternation for&s;ook their Hou&s;es and fled into the Country. <HI>Sivagy's</HI> Men entered the Town and plundered it for the &s;pace of four days burning &s;everal Hou&s;es. None but the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and <HI>Dutch</HI> &s;aved their quarters from the pillage, by the vi|gorous defence they made, and by means of the Cannon they planted, which <HI>Sivagy</HI> would not venture upon, having none of his own.</P>
<P>Nor dur&s;t he venture to attack the Ca&s;tle neither, though he knew very well that the riche&s;t things they had were conveighed thither, and e&s;pecial|ly a great deal of ready Money. He was affraid that attack might co&s;t him too much time, and that a&s;&s;i&s;tance coming in might make him leave the Plunder he had got in the Town; be&s;ides, the Ca&s;tle being in a condition to make defence, he would not have come off &s;o ea&s;ily as he had done el&s;e|where. So that he marched off with the Wealth he got: And it is believ|ed at <HI>Surrat</HI> that this <HI>Raja</HI> carried away in Jewels, Gold and Silver, to the va|lue of above thirty French Millions;<NOTE PLACE="marg">22 <ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> of Pearls in the hou&s;e of one <HI>Banian.</HI></NOTE> for in the Hou&s;e of one <HI>Banian</HI> he found twenty two Pound weight of &s;trung Pearls, be&s;ides a great quantity of others that were not as yet pierced.</P>
<P>One may indeed wonder that &s;o populous a Town &s;hould &s;o patiently &s;uffer it &s;elf to be Plundered by a handful of Men; but the <HI>Indians</HI> for the mo&s;t part are cowards. No &s;ooner did <HI>Sivagy</HI> appear with his &s;mall body of Men, but all fled, &s;ome to the Country to &s;ave them&s;elves at <HI>Baroche,</HI> and others to the Ca&s;tle, whither the Governour retreated with the fir&s;t. And none but the Chri&s;tians of <HI>Europe</HI> made good their Po&s;t and pre&s;erved them&s;elves. All the re&s;t of the Town was Plundered,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><P>The Chri&s;tians of <HI>Europe</HI> de|fended them|&s;elves again&s;t <HI>Sivagy.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Capucins</HI> e&s;caped.</P></NOTE> except the Mona|&s;tery of the <HI>Capucins.</HI> When the Plunderers came to their Convent, they pa&s;t it by; and had Orders from their General to do &s;o, becau&s;e the fir&s;t day in the Evening, Father <HI>Ambro&s;e,</HI> who was Superiour of it, being mo|ved with compa&s;&s;ion for the poor Chri&s;tians living in <HI>Surrat,</HI> went to the <HI>Raja</HI> and &s;pake in their favour, praying him at lea&s;t not to &s;uffer any vio|lence to be done to their Per&s;ons. <HI>Sivagy</HI> had a re&s;pect for him, took him into his protection, and granted what he had de&s;ired in favour of the Chri&s;tians.</P>
<P>The <HI>Great Mogul</HI> was &s;en&s;ibly affected with the Pillage of that Town, and the boldne&s;s of <HI>Sivagy;</HI> but his Affairs not &s;uffering him to pur&s;ue his revenge at that time, he di&s;&s;embled his re&s;entment and delayed it till another opportunity.</P>
<P>In the Year One thou&s;and &s;ix hundred &s;ixty &s;ix,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Auran-Zeb</HI> prai&s;es <HI>Sivagy</HI> that he may allure him to his Court.</NOTE> <HI>Auran-Zeb</HI> re&s;olved to di&s;patch him, and that he might accompi&s;h his de&s;ign, made as if he ap|proved what he had done, and prai&s;ed it as the action of a brave Man, re|jecting the blame upon the Governour of <HI>Surrat,</HI> who had not the courage to oppo&s;e him. He expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf thus to the other <HI>Rajas</HI> of Court, among&s;t whom he knew <HI>Sivagy</HI> had a great many Friends; and told them that he e&s;teemed that <HI>Raja</HI> for his Valour, and wi&s;hed he might come to Court; &s;aying openly that he would take it as a plea&s;ure if any would let him know &s;o much. Nay he bid one of them write to him, and gave his Royal word that he &s;hould receive no hurt; that he might come with all &s;ecurity, that he forgot what was pa&s;t, and that his Troops &s;hould be &s;o well treated, that he &s;hould have no cau&s;e to complain. Several <HI>Rajas</HI> wrote what the King had &s;aid, and made them&s;elves in a manner &s;ureties for the perfor|mance of his word; So that he made no difficulty to come to Court, and to bring his Son with him, having fir&s;t ordered his Forces to be always up|on
<PB N="30" REF="287">
their Guard,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Sivagy's</HI> com|ing to Court.</NOTE> under the command of an able Officer whom he left to head them.</P>
<P>At fir&s;t he met with all imaginable care&s;&s;es, but &s;ome Months after, per|ceiving a dryne&s;s in the King, he openly complained of it, and boldly told him, that he believed he had a mind to put him to death, though he was come on his Royal word to wait upon him,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The boldne&s;s of <HI>Sivagy</HI> in &s;peaking to the King.</NOTE> without any con&s;traint or nece&s;&s;ity that obliged him to it; but that his Maje&s;ty might know what Man he was, from <HI>Cha&s;ta-Can</HI> and the Governour of <HI>Surrat:</HI> That after all if he Peri&s;hed, there were tho&s;e who would revenge his death; and that hopeing they would do &s;o, he was re&s;olved to die with his own hands, and drawing his Dagger, made an attempt to kill him&s;elf, but was hindered and had Guards &s;et upon him.</P>
<P>The King would have willingly put him to death, but he feared an in&s;ur|rection of the <HI>Rajas.</HI> They already murmured at this u&s;age notwith&s;tanding the promi&s;e made to him; And all of them were &s;o much the more con|cerned for him, that mo&s;t part came only to Court upon the Kings word. That con&s;ideration obliged <HI>Auran-Zeb</HI> to treat him well, and to make much of his Son. He told him that it was never in his thoughts to have him put to death, and flattered him with the hopes of a good Government which he promi&s;ed him,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Sivagy's</HI> pre|tence.</NOTE> if he would go with him to <HI>Candabar,</HI> which then he de&s;igned to Be&s;iege. <HI>Sivagy</HI> pretended to con&s;ent, provided he might Command his own Forces. The King having granted him that, he de&s;i|red a Pa&s;&s;-port for their coming, and having got it, re&s;olved to make u&s;e of it for withdrawing from Court. He therefore gave Orders to tho&s;e whom he entru&s;ted with that Pa&s;&s;-port, and whom he &s;ent before under pretence of calling his Forces, to provide him Hor&s;es in certain places which he named to them, and they failed not to do it. When he thought it time to go meet them,<NOTE PLACE="marg">His e&s;cape.</NOTE> he got him&s;elf and his Son both to be carried privately in Panniers to the River-&s;ide. So &s;oon as they were over, they mounted Hor&s;es that were ready for them, and then he told the Water-man, that he might go and acquaint the King, that he had carried over <HI>Raja Si|vagy.</HI> They Po&s;ted it day and night, finding always fre&s;h Hor&s;es in the places he had appointed them to be brought to; and they pa&s;&s;ed every where by vertue of the Kings Pa&s;&s;-port: But the Son unable to bear the fa|tigue of &s;o hard Riding, died upon the Road. The <HI>Raja</HI> left Money to have his body honourably Burnt, and arrived afterwards in good health in his own territories.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Sivagy's</HI> &s;hape and way of li|ving.</NOTE><HI>Auran-Zeb</HI> was extreamly vext at that e&s;cape. Many believed that it was but a fal&s;e report, and that he was put to death; but the truth &s;oon was known. This <HI>Raja</HI> is &s;hort and tawny, with quick eyes that &s;hew a great deal of wit. He eats but once a day commonly, and is in good health; and when he Plundered <HI>Surrat</HI> in the Year One thou&s;and &s;ix hundred and &s;ixty four, he was but thirty five years of Age.</P>

<P>He employs his intere&s;t pretty often for the Heathen; and I &s;aw a Pagan whom they carried to Pri&s;on for a &s;light fault, delivered at his reque&s;t.

So that every one employs that day wherein they believe that God takes an account of the Actions of Men, in Praying to him, doing Alms-deeds, and &s;ending one another Pre|&s;ents. They end the Fe&s;tival with Lights and Bon-fires kindled in the Streets and publick places, and a great many Fire-works which flie about on all hands, whil'&s;t the Rich mutually treat one another with Collations and Fea&s;ts which they make in the very Streets or Shops.</P>

<P><HI>AGra</HI> is one of the large&s;t Provinces of <HI>Moguli&s;tan,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Agra.</NOTE> and its Capital Town which bears the &s;ame Name, is the greate&s;t Town of the <HI>Indies.</HI> It is di&s;tant from <HI>Surrat</HI> about two hundred and ten Leagues, which they make commonly in five and thirty or &s;ix and thirty days Journey of Caravan, and it lies in the Latitude of twenty eight degrees and half on the River <HI>Gemna,</HI> which &s;ome call <HI>Geminy,</HI> and Pliny <HI>Jomanes.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><P><HI>Gemna</HI> a Ri|ver.</P>
<P><HI>Jomanes</HI> River. The cour&s;e of the <HI>Gemna.</HI></P></NOTE> This River hath its &s;ource in the Mountains to the North of <HI>Dehly,</HI> from whence de&s;cending towards this Town, and receiving &s;everal rivulets in its cour&s;e, it makes a very con&s;iderable River. It runs by <HI>Agra,</HI> and having traver&s;ed &s;everal Countries, falls into the <HI>Ganges</HI> at the great Town of <HI>Halbas.</HI></P>
<P>There is no need of taking the pains that &s;ome have done,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Bacchus.</NOTE> to have re|cour&s;e to <HI>Bacchus</HI> for illu&s;trating <HI>Agra</HI> by an ancient Name. Before King <HI>Ecbar,</HI> it was no more but a Bourg which had a little Ca&s;tle of Earth, and pretended to no privilege over its Neighbours upon account of Antiquity; and indeed, there were never any marks of that to be found.</P>
<P>That Prince being plea&s;ed with the &s;eat of it, joyned &s;everal Villages thereunto: He gave them the form of a Town by other buildings which he rai&s;ed, and called it after his own Name <HI>Ecbar-Abad,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Agra</HI> called <HI>Bebar-Abad.</HI></NOTE> the habitation of <HI>Ecbar,</HI> where he e&s;tabli&s;hed the &s;eat of his Empire, in the year One thou|&s;and five hundred three&s;core and &s;ix. His declaration of that was enough to People it; for when the Merchants came to under&s;tand that the Court was there, they came from all parts,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Merchants Flock to <HI>Agra.</HI></NOTE> and not only the <HI>Banian</HI> Traders flock|ed thither, but Chri&s;tians al&s;o of all Per&s;wa&s;ions, as well as Mahometans, who &s;trove in emulation who &s;hould furni&s;h it with greate&s;t variety of Goods; and &s;eeing that Prince called the Je&s;uits thither,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Je&s;uits at <HI>Agra.</HI></NOTE> and gave them a Pen&s;ion to &s;ub&s;i&s;t on, Catholick Merchants made no &s;cruple to come and live there, and to this day the&s;e Fathers take the care of Spirituals, and teach their Children.</P>
<P>Though this Prince pretended to make <HI>Agra</HI> a place of con&s;equence, yet he Fortified it not neither with ramparts, Walls, nor Ba&s;tions, but only with a Ditch, hopeing to make it &s;o &s;trong in Soldiers and Inhabitants, that it &s;hould not need to fear the attempts of any Enemy.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ca&s;tle of <HI>Agra.</HI></NOTE> The Ca&s;tle was the fir&s;t thing that was built, which he re&s;olved to make the bigge&s;t at that time in the <HI>Indies:</HI> and the &s;ituation of the old one appearing good and commodious, he cau&s;ed it to be demoli&s;hed, and the foundations of the pre&s;ent to be laid. It was begirt with a Wall of Stone and Brick terra&s;&s;ed in &s;everal places, which is twenty Cubits high, and betwixt the Ca&s;tle and River a large place was left for the exerci&s;es the King &s;hould think fit to di|vert him&s;elf with.</P>
<P>The Kings Palace is in the Ca&s;tle.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Kings Pa|lace at <HI>Agra.</HI></NOTE> It contains three Courts adorned all round with Porches and Galleries that are Painted and Gilt; nay there are &s;ome peeces covered with plates of Gold. Under the Galleries of the fir&s;t Court, there are Lodgings made for the Kings Guards: The Officers Lodg|ings are in the &s;econd; and in the third, the &s;tately appartments of the King and his Ladies; from whence he goes commonly to a lovely Divan which looks to the River, there to plea&s;e him&s;elf with &s;eeing Elephants fight, his Troops exerci&s;e, and Plays which he orders to be made upon the Water, or in the open place.</P>
<P><PB N="34" REF="289"><NOTE PLACE="marg">Palaces of the great men at <HI>Agra.</HI></NOTE>This Palace is accompanied with five and twenty or thirty other very large ones, all in a line, which belong to the Princes and other great Lords of Court; and all together afford a mo&s;t delightful pro&s;pect to tho&s;e who are on the other &s;ide of the River, which would be a great deal more a|greeable, were it not for the long Garden-walls, which contribute much to the rendering the Town &s;o long as it is. There are upon the &s;ame line &s;everal le&s;s Palaces and other Buildings. All being de&s;irous to enjoy the lovely pro&s;pect and convenience of the Water of the <HI>Gemna,</HI> endeavoured to purcha&s;e ground on that &s;ide, which is the cau&s;e that the Town is very long but narrow, and excepting &s;ome fair Streets that are in it, all the re&s;t are very narrow, and without Symmetry.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Square places at <HI>Agra.</HI></NOTE>Before the Kings Palace, there is a very large Square, and twelve other be&s;ides of le&s;s extent within the Town.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Sepulchre of King <HI>Ecbar.</HI></NOTE>King <HI>Gebanguir</HI> cau&s;ed one to be built for King <HI>Ecbar</HI> his Father, upon an eminence of the Town.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Air of <HI>Agra.</HI></NOTE>Now after all the Air of <HI>Agra</HI> is very incommodious in the Summer-time, and it is verv likely that the exce&s;&s;ive heat which &s;corches the Sands that environ this Town, was one of the chief cau&s;es which made King <HI>Cha-Gehan</HI> change the Climate,<NOTE PLACE="marg">King <HI>Cha-Ge|han</HI> pri&s;oner in his Palace.</NOTE> and chu&s;e to live at <HI>Dehly.</HI> Little thought this Prince that one day he would be forced to live at <HI>Agra,</HI> what aver&s;ion &s;oe|ver he had to it, and far le&s;s &s;till, that he &s;hould be Pri&s;oner there in his own Palace, and &s;o end his days in affliction and trouble. That misfor|tune though,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Auran-Zeb</HI> impri&s;oned the King his Fa|ther.</NOTE> befel him, and <HI>Auran-Zeb</HI> his third Son, was the cau&s;e of it, who having got the better of his Brothers, both by cunning and force, made &s;ure of the Kings Per&s;on and Trea&s;ures, by means of Soldiers whom he craftily &s;lipt into the Palace, and under who&s;e Cu&s;tody the King was kept till he died.</P>

<P>The Town of <HI>Agra</HI> is Populous as a great Town ought to be, but not &s;o as to be able to &s;end out Two hundred thou&s;and &s;ighting men into the Field, as &s;ome have written. The Palaces and Gardens take up the greate&s;t part of it, &s;o that its extent is no infallible Argument of the number of its In|habitants. The ordinary Hou&s;es are low, and tho&s;e of the commoner &s;ort of People are but Straw, containing but few People a piece; and the truth is, one may walk the Streets without being crouded, and meet with no throng but when the Court is there: But at that time, I have been told there is great confu&s;ion, and infinite numbers of People to be &s;een; and no won|der indeed, &s;eeing the Streets are narrow, and that the King be&s;ides his Hou&s;hold, (who are many,) is always attended by an Army for his Guard; and the <HI>Rajas, Omras, Man&s;epdars</HI> and other great Men, have great Retinues, and mo&s;t part of the Merchants al&s;o follow the Court, not to reckon a va&s;t number of Trade&s;men, and thou&s;ands of followers who have all their &s;ub|&s;i&s;tence from it.</P>
<P>Some affirm that there are twenty five thou&s;and Chri&s;tian Families in <HI>Agra,</HI> but all do not agree in that. This indeed is certain,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chri&s;tians at <HI>Agra.</HI></NOTE> that there are few Heathen and <HI>Par&s;is</HI> in re&s;pect of <HI>Mahometans</HI> there, and the&s;e &s;urpa&s;s all the other Sects in power, as they do in number.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dutch Factory at <HI>Agra.</HI></NOTE> The Dutch have a Factory in the Town; but the Engli&s;h have none now, becau&s;e it did not turn to account.</P>
<P>The Officers are the &s;ame as at <HI>Surrat,</HI> and do the &s;ame Duties, and it is ju&s;t &s;o in all the great Towns of the Empire. We told you that the <HI>Four&s;|dar</HI> or Prevo&s;t, is to an&s;wer for all the Robberies committed in the Coun|try; And that was the rea&s;on why Mr. <HI>Beber,</HI> one of the Envoys to the great <HI>Mogul,</HI> for the concerns of the <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> Company in <HI>France,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Mr. <HI>Beber</HI> Rob|bed.</NOTE> having been Robbed, demanded from that Officer of <HI>Agra,</HI> the Sum of thirty one thou&s;and two hundred <HI>Roupies,</HI> which he affirmed were taken from him. That Sum a&s;toni&s;hed the <HI>Four&s;dar</HI> who told him that he did not believe he had lo&s;t &s;o much; and becau&s;e the Envoy made An&s;wer that the &s;um would certainly encrea&s;e, if he delayed to pay down the Money, and if he gave him time to call to mind a great many things which he had forgot; He wrote to the <HI>Great Mogul,</HI> and informed him that it was impo&s;&s;ible that that Envoy could have lo&s;t &s;o great a Sum. <HI>Mon&s;ieur Beber</HI> had al&s;o made his addre&s;&s;es at Court; but it being pretty difficult to give an equitable &s;en|tence in the Ca&s;e, the King, that he might make an end of it, command|ed the <HI>Four&s;dar</HI> to pay the Envoy fifteen thou&s;and <HI>Roupies,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Liberality of the Great <HI>Mo|gul.</HI></NOTE> and becau&s;e he was wounded when he was Robbed, he ordered him out of his Exchequer, ten thou&s;and <HI>Roupies</HI> for his Blood.</P>

The Breeches of the Indians are commonly of Cotten-cloath, they come down to the mid leg, and &s;ome wear them a little longer, &s;o that they reach to the Anckle. They who affect Rich cloathing, wear Silk breeches &s;triped with different colours, which are &s;o long that they mu&s;t be plated upon the Leg, much in the &s;ame manner as formerly Silk-&s;tockings were worn in <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Shirts.</NOTE>The Shirt hangs over the Breeches, as the fa&s;hion is all over the <HI>Levant.</HI> The&s;e Shirts are fa&s;tened as the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> are, and heretofore had no greater opening than theirs; but becau&s;e the Moors Shirts are open from top to bottom, as their upper Garments, which they call <HI>Cabas</HI> are; many People at pre&s;ent wear them in that fa&s;hion, becau&s;e they find them more com|modious, being more ea&s;ily put on and off: Be&s;ides that when one is alone, he may open them and take the fre&s;h Air.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Arcaluck.</NOTE>When it is cold Weather, the Indians wear over their Shirt an <HI>Arcaluck</HI> or <HI>Ju&s;t au corps</HI> quilted with Cotten and Pinked, the out&s;ide whereof is commonly of a &s;chite or Painted &s;tuff. The colours upon them are &s;o good and lively, that though they be &s;oiled by wearing, yet they look as fre&s;h again as at fir&s;t when they are wa&s;hed.

It hath a collar two fingers breadth high, of the &s;ame Stuff with the re&s;t, they button not that Ve&s;t as we do our Coats, but they fold it cro&s;s ways over the Stomack; fir&s;t from the right to the left, and then from the left to the right. They tie it with Ribbons of the &s;ame Stuff, which are two Fingers broad and a Foot long; and there are &s;even or eight of them from the upper part down to the Haunches, of which they only tie the fir&s;t and la&s;t, and let the re&s;t hang negligently as being more graceful.</P>
<P>The&s;e <HI>Cabas</HI> are commonly made of white Stuff, that's to &s;ay of Cotten-cloath, to the end they may be the lighter, and the neater by being often wa&s;hed; and that agrees with the fa&s;hion of the Ancient <HI>Indians.</HI> I &s;ay of Cotten-cloath,<NOTE PLACE="marg">There is no Flax in the <HI>In|dies.</HI></NOTE> becau&s;e they u&s;e no other in the <HI>Indies,</HI> and have no Flax there: Neverthele&s;s &s;ome wear them of Painted cloath, but that is not the Gentile&s;t manner of Apparel, and when the Rich do not wear White they, u&s;e Silk, and chu&s;e the broade&s;t Stuff they can find, which commonly is &s;treaked with &s;everal colours.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Fighting of Bea&s;ts.</NOTE>THere are a great many at <HI>Agra,</HI> who are curious in breeding up of Bea&s;ts, to have the plea&s;ure to make them Fight together: But &s;eeing they cannot reach to Elephants and Lions, becau&s;e it co&s;ts dear to feed them, mo&s;t part content them&s;elves with He-goats, Weathers, Rams, Cocks, Quailes, Stags, and Antilopes, to entertain their Friends with the Fightings of the&s;e Bea&s;ts.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Indian</HI> Anti|lopes.</NOTE>The <HI>Indian</HI> Antilopes, are not altogether like tho&s;e of other Countries; they have even a great deal more courage, and are to be di&s;tingui&s;hed by the Horns. The Horns of the ordinary Antilopes are greyi&s;h, and but half as long as the Horns of tho&s;e in the <HI>Indies,</HI> which are blacki&s;h, and a large Foot and a half long. The&s;e Horns grow winding to the point like a &s;crew; and the <HI>Faquirs</HI> and <HI>Santons</HI> carry commonly two of them pieced together; they are armed with Iron at both ends, and they make u&s;e of them, as of a little Staff.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Pidgeons.</NOTE>There are Pidgeons in that Country all over green, which differ from ours only in colour: The Fowlers take them with Bird-lime, in this man|ner;<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Screen for Fowling.</NOTE> they carry before them a kind of light Shed or Screen, that covers the whole Body, and has holes in it to &s;ee through; the Pidgeons &s;eeing no Man, are not at all &s;cared when the Fowler draws near, &s;o that he cunningly catches them, one after another, with a Wand and Bird lime on it, none offering to flie away.

<P>The <HI>Indians</HI> are very dexterous at Game; they take Water-fowl with great facility, as thus: The Fowlers &s;wim almo&s;t upright, yet &s;o, that they have their Head above Water,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The catching of Water-fowl.</NOTE> which they hide with a Pot full of holes, to let in the Air, and give them &s;ight.

<P>The Hunt&s;men of <HI>Agra</HI> go five Days Journey from the Town, as far as a Mountain called <HI>Nerouer,</HI> where there is a mine of excellent Iron;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nerouer.</NOTE> but their bu&s;ine&s;s in going &s;o far is only to catch a kind of Wild Cows which they call <HI>Merous,</HI> that are to be found in a Wood round this Hill,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Merous,</HI> Wild-Cows.</NOTE> which is upon the Road from <HI>Surrat</HI> to <HI>Golconda;</HI> and the&s;e Cows being commonly very lovely, they make great advantage of them.</P>
<P>One may &s;ee a great many Pictures in the Indies upon Paper and Pa&s;t-board, but generally they are dull pieces,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Indian Pi|ctures.</NOTE> and none are e&s;teemed but tho&s;e of <HI>Agra</HI> and <HI>Dehly:</HI> However, &s;ince tho&s;e of <HI>Agra</HI> are for the mo&s;t part indecent, and repre&s;ent Lacivious Po&s;tures, wor&s;e than tho&s;e of <HI>Aretin,</HI> there are but few civil Europeans that will buy them.</P>
<P>They have a way in this Town of working in Gold upon Agat,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Working upon Agat and Chry&s;tal.</NOTE> Chry|&s;tal, and other brittle matters, which our Gold&s;miths and Lapidaries have not. When the Indians would beautifie Ve&s;&s;els, Cups, or Coffers; be&s;ides the Circles of Gold they put about them, they engrave Flowers and other Figures, and al&s;o encha&s;e Stones upon them. They cut leaves of Gold to fill up the void &s;paces of the Figures, lay &s;everal pieces one upon another, and encha&s;e them &s;o artificially in the hollow places, with an Iron In&s;trument like a Graver, that when the void &s;paces are fil|led up, it looks like Ma&s;&s;ie Gold. They do the &s;ame with Stones, they encompa&s;s them al&s;o with &s;uch pieces of Leaf-Gold, and pre&s;s them in &s;o clo&s;e that the Stones hold very well.</P>
<P>They make Rings about Ve&s;&s;els, either about the middle or brims, of a kind of Gold made into little round Rods, which they beat upon an An|vil, till they be reduced into flat thin Plates; then they take the mea&s;ure of the part of the Ve&s;&s;el which they would incircle, and having mo&s;t ex|actly bent the Ring, they Soulder the two ends of it together, and put it upon the part of the Ve&s;&s;el they intend it for; &s;o that it holds very well, provided one have the skill to adju&s;t it true to the place marked: If Han|dles be nece&s;&s;ary to the Ve&s;&s;els, or Locks for the Coffers of Agat or Cry|&s;tal, they &s;oulder them to the Ring with the &s;ame Art that they &s;ouldered the two ends of it; but they do it after another way than our Gold|&s;miths do. For that end they make u&s;e of little red Beans which are black at the end, and are the fruit of a <HI>Convolvulus,</HI> called in Indian <HI>Gomt|chi,</HI> and in the <HI>Telenghi</HI> Language, <HI>Gourghindel.</HI> They peel off the Skin which is dry and hard, and taking the in&s;ide of the Bean that is yellowi&s;h, they grind it upon an Iron-Plate with a little Water till it be di&s;&s;olved in|to a Liquid Solution; then they pound a little bit of Borax, mix it with that Solution, and with this mixture dawb the ends which they in|tend to &s;oulder, and having heated them with a Coal, joyn them toge|ther; &s;o that the two &s;ides clo&s;e fa&s;t and hold extraordinarily well.</P>
<P>This work is performed by poor People, and &s;ometimes by little Boys, who do it very skilfully and quickly, for a matter of two Crowns for each tole of Gold; and &s;omething is al&s;o given to him that beats and flat|tens the Rods of Gold: However none of the&s;e People know how to Enammel Gold.</P>

The two chief Streets of <HI>Dehly</HI> may be reckoned a|mong&s;t the rarities of it, for they are wide, &s;treight, and very long: They have Arches all along on both &s;ides, which &s;erve for Shops for tho&s;e who have their Ware-hou&s;e backwards. Over the&s;e Arches there is a Terras-walk to take the Air on when they come out of their Lodgings; and the&s;e Streets ending at the great Square and Ca&s;tle, make the lovelie&s;t Pro|&s;pect that can be &s;een in a Town. There is nothing el&s;e con&s;iderable in <HI>Dehly.</HI> The ordinary Hou&s;es are but of Earth and Canes; and the other Streets are &s;o narrow, that they are altogether incommodious.</P>
<P>But that inconvenience &s;eems to contribute &s;omewhat to the Reputation of that Capital City of the Empire of the Mogul, for &s;eeing there is an extra|ordinary croud in the Streets while the Court is there, the Indians are per|&s;waded that it is the mo&s;t populous City in the World; and neverthele&s;s I have been told,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Great Mo|gul</HI>'s Court is very nume|rous.</NOTE> that it appears to be a De&s;art when the King is ab&s;ent.

When I &s;ay, we con&s;ider <HI>Dehly</HI> void of all tho&s;e I have mentioned, and of many more &s;till, it will ea&s;ily be believed, that that Town is no great matter when the King is not there; and if there have been four hundred thou&s;and Men in it when he was there, there hardly remains the &s;ixth part in his ab&s;ence.

<P>THeir Swords are four Fingers broad, very thick,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Mogul</HI>'s Arms.</NOTE> and by con&s;equence heavy; they are crooked a little, and cut only on the convex &s;ide.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The form of the <HI>Mogul</HI>'s Swords.</NOTE> The Guard is very plain; commonly no more but a handle of Iron, with a cro&s;s Bar of the &s;ame underneath the Pummel which is al&s;o of I|ron, is neither Round nor Oval, but is flat above and below like a Whir|ligigg, that the Sword may not &s;lip out of their Hands when they fight. The Swords made by the Indians are very brittle; but the Engli&s;h furni&s;h them with good ones brought from <HI>England.</HI> The <HI>Mogul</HI>'s u&s;e Wa&s;te-belts for their Swords; they are two Fingers broad, and have two Hangers in|to which the Sword is put, &s;o that the Point is always upwards; and all the ordinary &s;ort of People in the <HI>Indies</HI> carry them commonly in their Hand, or upon their Shoulder like a Musket.</P>
<P>It is their cu&s;tom al&s;o to carry a Dagger by their &s;ides,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Moguls</HI> Dagger.</NOTE> the Blade being near a Foot long, and above four Fingers broad at the Handle.

<P>The Indians never want one of the&s;e Daggers by their &s;ide, betwixt the Girdle and <HI>Caba;</HI> they carry it always bending a little &s;ideways, &s;o that the end of the Guard comes pretty high, and the Point pretty low upon their Stomach.

<P>Their other offen&s;ive Arms are the Bow and Arrow, the Javelin or <HI>Za|gaye,</HI> and &s;ometimes the Pi&s;tol: The Foot carry a Musket, or a Pike twelve Foot long.</P>
<P>They have Cannon al&s;o in their Towns,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Moguls</HI> Cannon good for nothing.</NOTE> but &s;ince they melt the Metal in diver&s;e Furnaces, &s;o that &s;ome of it mu&s;t needs be better melted than others when they mingle all together, their Cannon commonly is good for nothing.</P>

<P>An hour after, the Groom gives the Hor&s;e Gra&s;s, and continues to do &s;o at certain times, every hour of the day after; and about four of the Clock, after noon, he gives him three Pound of dried Pea&s;e brui&s;ed; he mingles Water with them, and &s;ometimes a little Sugar, according to the di&s;po|&s;ition the Hor&s;e is in;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Litter of dry Hor&s;e-dung.</NOTE> and when Night is drawing on, he carefully pre|pares his Hor&s;es litter, which is of dry Dung, laid very thick, which he is very careful to provide.

<P>When an Elephant is in his ordinary di&s;po&s;ition,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Elephants do|cile.</NOTE> his Governour can make him do what he plea&s;es with his Trunck.

The governour &s;its on the Elephants Neck, when he makes him do any thing, and with a prick of Iron in the end of a Stick, he commonly makes him Obey him. In a word, an Elephant is a very tractable Crea|ture, provided he be not angry, nor in lu&s;t; but when he is &s;o, the Go|vernour him&s;elf is in much danger, and &s;tands in need of a great deal of art, to avoid ruin; for then the Elephant turns all things top&s;y-turvy,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Elephants fu|rious.</NOTE> and would make &s;trange havock, if they did not &s;top him, as they commonly do, with fire-works that they throw at him.</P>

The Courts of the Palace are covered all over with Pavillions of Rich Stuffs; all that is magnificent in Pretious Stones, Gold and Silver is expo&s;ed to view in the Halls; particularly the great and glittering Throne, with tho&s;e others that are carried about in progre&s;&s;es, which are likewi&s;e adorned with Jewels.

The fir&s;t day of the Fea&s;t, the Throne was placed in the Roy|al Hall, and was covered all over with the Jewels of the Crown; the num|ber of them was the greater, that there was but one of the Kings Thrones
<PB N="50" REF="297">
brought; and that (as it is u&s;ual) the Jewels of the other little Thrones had been taken off, for the adorning of this.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A Fair of the Ladies of the <HI>Serraglio.</HI></NOTE>The Fe&s;tival began in the <HI>Serraglio,</HI> by a Fair that was kept there. The Ladies and Daughters of the great Lords, were permitted to come to it; and the Court-Ladies of le&s;s Quality, (who thought them&s;elves witty enough to make their Court,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The great La|dies, Shop-keepers.</NOTE> by putting off the curious Things that they had brought thither) were the Shop-keepers: But the&s;e had not all the Trade to them|&s;elves; for the Wives of the <HI>Omras</HI> and <HI>Rajas</HI> (who were allowed to come in) opened Shop al&s;o, and brought with them the riche&s;t Goods they could find; and which they thought &s;uited be&s;t with the King, and the Prince&s;&s;es of his <HI>Serraglio.</HI> Many had occa&s;ion by &s;elling, and di&s;puting plea&s;antly and wittily, about the Price of the things, which the King and his Wives came to cheapen, to make their Husbands Court; and to &s;lip in Pre&s;ents to tho&s;e that could &s;erve them in bettering their Fortune, or keeping them as they were.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Begum.</NOTE>The King and his <HI>Begum,</HI> pay'd often double value for a thing, when the Shop-keeper pleas'd them; but that was, when they rallied wittily and gen|tilely (as People of Quality commonly do) in buying and &s;elling: And &s;o it happened, that the wittie&s;t and faire&s;t were always mo&s;t favoured. All the&s;e &s;tranger Ladies, were entertained in the <HI>Serraglio</HI> with Fea&s;ting, and Dancings of <HI>Quenchenies,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Quenchenies.</NOTE> who are Women and Maids of a Ca&s;te of that name, having no other Profe&s;&s;ion but that of Dancing: And this Fair la&s;t|ed five days.</P>
<P>It is true, The Commodities &s;old there, were not &s;o fine, nor rich, as they would have been, had the Fe&s;tival been kept in <HI>Dehly</HI> or <HI>Agra;</HI> but the be&s;t, and mo&s;t pretious Things that were to be found in <HI>Azmer,</HI> and in the neare&s;t Towns, were expo&s;ed to Sale there; wherewith the King was ve|ry well &s;ati&s;fied.</P>
<P>During the&s;e rejoycings of the <HI>Serraglio,</HI> The great Men, who kept Guard, entertained them&s;elves at their Po&s;ts, or el&s;ewhere; And there were a great many Tables &s;erved at the Kings charges, which gave them occa&s;ion to Celebrate the <HI>Neurous,</HI> or New Years Fea&s;t merrily.</P>
<P>The King appeared daily in the <HI>Amcas,</HI> at his u&s;ual hour, but not in ex|traordinary Magnificence before the &s;eventh day; and then the Lords (who had every day changed Cloaths) appeared in their riche&s;t Apparel.

The Fe&s;tival concluded at Court, by a review of the Kings Elephants and Hor&s;es, pompou&s;ly equipped; and in the Town by a great many Fire-works, that came after their Fea&s;ting. <HI>Gehanguir,</HI> indeed, gave not the Princes, and great Lords, the equivalent of the Pre|&s;ents they made him at this Solemnity: But he rewarded them afterwards by Offices, and Employments.

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. XXIX.</HI> Of the Bea&s;ts of the Country of <HI>Azmer,</HI> and of the Saltpetre.</HEAD>
<P>THere is in the&s;e Countries, a Bea&s;t like a Fox in the Snout, which is no bigger than a Hare: the Hair of it, is of the colour of a Stags, and the Teeth like to a Dogs. It yields mo&s;t excellent Musk; for at the Belly it hath a Bladder full of corrupt Blood, and that Blood maketh the Musk,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Musk Animal.</NOTE> or is rather the Musk it &s;elf: They take it from it, and immediately cover the place where the Bladder is cut, with Leather, to hinder the &s;cent from evaporating: But after this Operation is made, the Bea&s;t is not long liv'd.</P>
<P>There are al&s;o towards <HI>Azmer,</HI> Pullets who&s;e Skin is all over black,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Pullets.</NOTE> as well as their Bones, though the Fle&s;h of them be very white, and their Feathers of another colour.</P>
<P>In the extremity of this Province, the Maids are very early Marriageable,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Maids Marri|ageable at 8 or 9 years of age.</NOTE> and &s;o they are in many other places of the <HI>Indies,</HI> where mo&s;t part can en|joy Man, at the age of eight or nine years, and have Children at ten. That's a very ordinary thing in the Country, where the young ones go naked, and wear nothing on their Bodies, but a bit of Cloath to cover their Privities.</P>
<P>Mo&s;t of the Children in the&s;e Countries have the &s;ame playes to divert them with, as among&s;t us: they commonly make u&s;e of Tops, Giggs,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Childrens playes.</NOTE> and Bull-flies in the &s;ea&s;on; of Childrens Trumpets, and many other Toys of that nature. The People are rude and uncivil: The Men are great clowns, and very impudent; they make a horrid noi&s;e when they have any quar|rel, but what Pa&s;&s;ion &s;oever they &s;eem to be in, and what bitter words &s;o|ever they utter, they never come to blows. The Servants are very unfaith|ful, and many times rob their Ma&s;ters.</P>
<P>There are very venemous Scorpions in that Country,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Venemous Scorpions. The remedy of Fire.</NOTE> but the <HI>Indians</HI> have &s;everal remedies to cure their Stinging, and the be&s;t of all is Fire. They take a burning Coal, and put it near the wound; they hold it there as long and as near as they can: The venom keeps one from being incommoded by the heat of the Fire; on the contrary, the Poi&s;on is perceived to work out of the Wound by little and little, and in a &s;hort time after, one is perfectly cured.</P>
<P>The ways of this Country being very Stony,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Oxen are &s;hod.</NOTE> they &s;hoe the Oxen when they are to Travel far on the&s;e ways. They ca&s;t them with a Rope fa&s;ten|ed to two of their Legs, and &s;o &s;oon as they are down, they tye their four Feet together, which they put upon an Engine made of two Sticks in form of an X; and then they take two little thin and light pieces of Iron, which they apply to each Foot, one piece covering but one half Foot, and that they fa&s;ten with three Nails above an Inch long, which are clenched upon the &s;ide of the Hooffs, as Hor&s;es with us are &s;hod.</P>
<P>Seeing the Oxen in the <HI>Indies</HI> are very tame,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Indian</HI> Oxen.</NOTE> many People make u&s;e of them in Travelling, and ride them like Hor&s;es; though commonly they goe but at a very &s;low pace. In&s;tead of a Bit, they put one or two &s;mall &s;trings through the Gri&s;tle of the Oxes No&s;trils, and throw over his Head a good large Rope fa&s;tened to the&s;e &s;trings, as a Bridle, which is held up by the bunch he hath on the fore part of his back, that our Oxen have not. They Saddle him as they do a Hor&s;e, and if he be but a little &s;purred, he'll go very fa&s;t; and there are &s;ome that will go as fa&s;t as a good Hor&s;e.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Oxen are Saddled.</NOTE> The&s;e Bea&s;ts are made u&s;e of generally all over the <HI>Indies;</HI> and with them only

When People of quality have lovely Oxen,<NOTE PLACE="marg">They have great care of the Oxen.</NOTE> they keep them with a great deal of care; they deck the ends of their Horns with &s;heaths of Copper; they u&s;e them to Cloaths as Hor&s;es are, and they are daily curried and well fed.

<P>After all, no part of this Province is fertile, but the Countries about <HI>Azmer,</HI> and <HI>Soret,</HI> for the Countries of <HI>Ge&s;&s;elmere,</HI> and <HI>Bando,</HI> are Barren.

The <HI>Indians</HI> fill a great hole with that Earth, and pound it in Water with great pounders of very hard Timber, when they have reduced it into a Liquid ma&s;h, they let it re&s;t, to the end the Water may imbibe all the Saltpetre out of the Earth:<NOTE PLACE="marg">The way of making Salt|petre.</NOTE> This mixture having continued &s;o for &s;ome time, they draw off what is clear, and put it into great Pots, wherein they let it boil, and continually &s;cum it; when it is well boiled, they again drain what is clear out of the&s;e Pots, and that being congealed and dryed in the Sun, where they let it &s;tand for a certain time, it is in its perfection; and then they carry it to the Sea-port Towns, and e&s;pecially to <HI>Surrat,</HI> where the <HI>Europeans</HI> and others buy it to Balla&s;t their Ships with, and &s;ell el&s;ewhere.</P>

Some, (I confe&s;s,) have the Chariot &s;ur|rounded with Balli&s;ters of Ivory, but few are willing to be at the charges of that, and the Cu&s;tom of making u&s;e of that Net-work of Leather, makes that mo&s;t part cares not for Balli&s;ters, but go &s;o about the Town, &s;itting after the <HI>Levantine</HI> manner, upon a neat Carpet that covers the bottom of the Chariot. Some cover it above with a &s;light Imperial, but that com|monly is only when they go into the Country, to defend them from the Sun-beams.</P>
<P>This Machine hath no more but two Wheels put under the &s;ide of the Chariot, and not advancing outwards,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Wheeles of the <HI>Indian</HI> Chariots.</NOTE> they are of the height of the fore Wheels of our Coaches; have eight &s;quare &s;poaks, are four or five fingers thick, and many times are not &s;hod.

<P>The Wheels of Waggons or Carts, for carrying of Goods,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cart-Wheeles.</NOTE> have no Spoaks; they are made of one whole piece of &s;olid Timber, in form of a Mill-&s;tone, and the bottom of the Cart, is always a thick frame of Wood. The&s;e Carts are drawn by eight or ten Oxen, according to the heavine&s;s of the Loads. When a Merchant conveys any thing of con&s;equence, he ought to have four Soldiers, or four Pions, by the &s;ides of the Waggon; to hold the ends of the Rope that are tyed to it, to keep it from overturn|ing, if it come to heeld in bad way; and that way is u&s;ed in all Caravans, though commonly they con&s;i&s;t of above two hundred Waggons.</P>

The Comman|ders and Officers of the&s;e Towns are <HI>Mahometans;</HI> and by con&s;equence, it may be &s;aid, that mo&s;t part of the Inhabitants are of the &s;ame Religion: But it contains a great many <HI>Banians</HI> al&s;o,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Banians.</NOTE> for <HI>Multan</HI> is their chief Rendez|vous for Trading into <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> where they do what the Jews do in other places; but they are far more cunning, for nothing e&s;capes them, and they let &s;lip no occa&s;ion of getting the penny, how &s;mall &s;oever it be.</P>
<P>The Tribe of the&s;e <HI>Banians,</HI> is the fourth in dignity among&s;t the Ca&s;tes, Tribes, or Sects of the Gentiles; of whom we &s;hall treat in the &s;equel of this Relation.

They are of a plea&s;ing humour, for they reject no &s;ervice, whether honoura|ble or ba&s;e, and are always ready to &s;atisfie tho&s;e who employ them; and therefore, every one hath his <HI>Banian</HI> in the <HI>Indies,</HI> and &s;ome per&s;ons of Qua|lity intru&s;t them with all they have, though they be not ignorant of their Hypocri&s;ie and Avarice.

They are commonly very Jealous of their Wives, who at <HI>Multan</HI> are fairer than the Men, but &s;till of a very brown complexion, and love to Paint.</P>

However, all the&s;e Rivers have their Sources in the Mountains of the North, and make up the <HI>Iudus,</HI> that for a long way, goes by the name of <HI>Sinde,</HI> into which they fall; and that's the rea&s;on why this River is &s;ometime called <HI>Indy,</HI> and &s;om|times <HI>Sindy.</HI> The chief Town is not now upon the <HI>Ravy</HI> as it was for a long time, becau&s;e that River having a very flat Channel, has fallen off from it above a quarter of a League.</P>

The chief Town (lying upon the &s;ide of the <HI>Ganges,</HI> at the mouth of the River <HI>Gemini</HI>) bears the name of the Province; for a long time it was one of the Bulwarks of the Kingdom of the <HI>Patans,</HI> and is the &s;ame Town which <HI>Pliny</HI> calls <HI>Chry&s;obacra.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Chry&s;obacra.</NOTE> It fell under the power of the Great Mogul <HI>Ecbar,</HI> after he had &s;ubdued the Kingdom of <HI>Bengala:</HI> He cau&s;ed the &s;trong Citadel to be built there, which &s;tands upon a tongue of Land, begirt with three Walls, whereof the la&s;t (I mean the outmo&s;t Wall) was of very hard red Stone. That Ca&s;tle is adorned with a very ancient Obelisk; it is above &s;ixty Foot high from the ground, and has many In&s;criptions upon it; but the Letters of itare &s;o worn out, that one cannot &s;o much as di&s;tingui&s;h the Character.</P>
<P>The Kings Palace is al&s;o a fair pile of Building; and underneath it there are places Arched, where the Pagods are carefully kept, which the Peo|ple of the Countrey attribute to <HI>Adam</HI> and <HI>Eve,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Adam, Eve.</NOTE> who&s;e Religion they pre|tend to follow: Thither comes at certain times an incredible concours of People, in Pilgrimage from all parts of the <HI>Indies;</HI> and they are drawn thi|ther by the belief they have, that <HI>Adam</HI> and <HI>Eve</HI> were created there: But be|fore they approach that place (which they look upon to be holy) they throw them&s;elves &s;tark naked into the <HI>Ganges</HI> to be purified,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Indians</HI> Purification in the <HI>Ganges.</HI></NOTE> and they have their Beards and Hair, that they may merit the Honour of being introduced.

It many times happens that a <HI>Banian</HI> will give a <HI>Faquir</HI> con&s;iderable Sums of Money, be|cau&s;e he has the boldne&s;s to place him&s;elf near his Shop,<NOTE PLACE="marg">F<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">quirs.</NOTE> and to prote&s;t that he'll kill him&s;elf if he be not &s;upplied with what he demands: The <HI>Banian</HI> promi&s;es fair, and brings it him; but becau&s;e the fanta&s;tical <HI>Faquir</HI> under|&s;tands that &s;everal have contributed to that Charity, he openly refu&s;es it, and goes about to execute what he hath threatned, if the <HI>Banian</HI> alone fur|ni&s;h not the Sum; and the <HI>Banian</HI> knowing that &s;ome <HI>Faquirs</HI> have been &s;o de&s;perate as to kill them&s;elves upon the like occa&s;ion, is &s;o much a fool as to give it out of his own Pur&s;e, and to give the others back again what they had contributed.</P>
<P>The&s;e <HI>Faquirs</HI> (who give them&s;elves out to be of a Religious Order) have commonly no place to retreat unto, unle&s;s it be &s;ome Pagods; and they cannot be better compared (if you'll &s;et a&s;ide the Penances they do) than to <HI>Gyp&s;ies,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Gyp&s;ies, Fa|quirs.</NOTE> for their way of Living is like theirs; and I believe their Profe&s;&s;ion has the &s;ame Original, which is <HI>Libertini&s;me.</HI> However, they attribute it to a Prince named <HI>Revan,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Prince <HI>Revan.

But if &s;ome of the&s;e <HI>Faquirs</HI> be good Men,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Faquirs</HI> Rogues.</NOTE> there are al&s;o very Rogues a|mong&s;t them; and the <HI>Mogul</HI> Princes are not troubled, when &s;uch of them as commit violences are killed.</P>
<P>One may meet with &s;ome of them in the Countrey &s;tark naked with Co|lours and Trumpets, who ask Charity with Bow and Arrow in hand; and when they are the &s;tronge&s;t, they leave it not to the di&s;cretion of Travellers to give or refu&s;e. The&s;e wretches have no con&s;ideration even for tho&s;e that feed them; I have &s;een &s;ome of them in the <HI>Caravanes,</HI> who made it their whole bu&s;ine&s;s to play tricks, and to mole&s;t Travellers, though they had all their &s;ub&s;i&s;tence from them. Not long &s;ince I was in a <HI>Caravane,</HI> where &s;ome of the&s;e <HI>Faquirs</HI> were, who took a fancy to &s;uffer no body to &s;leep: All night long they did nothing but Sing and Preach; and in&s;tead of banging them &s;oundly to make them hold their peace (as they ought to have been &s;erved) the Company prayed them civilly, but they took it ill; &s;o that they doubled their Cries and Singing, and they who could not Sing, laugh'd and made a mock of the re&s;t of the <HI>Caravane.</HI></P>
<P>The&s;e <HI>Faquirs</HI> were &s;ent by their Superiours, into I know not what Coun|trey full of <HI>Banians,</HI> to demand of them Two thou&s;and <HI>Roupies,</HI> with a cer|tain quantity of Rice and <HI>Mans</HI> of Butter; and they had orders not to return without fulfilling their Commi&s;&s;ion. This is their way all over the <HI>Indies,</HI> where by their <HI>Mammeries,</HI> they have accu&s;tomed the Gentiles to give them what they demand, without daring to refu&s;e. There are a great many <HI>Faquirs</HI> among the <HI>Mahometans,</HI> as well as among&s;t the Idolaters, who are al&s;o Vagabonds, and wor&s;e than they: and commonly both of them are treated alike.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Pagods of <HI>Elora.</HI></NOTE>AT <HI>Surrat</HI> I was told great matters of the Pagods of <HI>Elora;</HI> and there|fore I had a mind to &s;ee them, &s;o that &s;o &s;oon as I came to <HI>Aurangea|bad,</HI> I &s;ought out for an Interpreter to go along with me; but it being im|po&s;&s;ible for me to find one, I re&s;olved to take my Servants with me, and make that little Journey alone. And becau&s;e my Oxen were weary, I hi|red a little Waggon to carry me thither, and took two <HI>Pions</HI> more be&s;ides tho&s;e I had: I gave all the four, half a Crown Piece, and leaving my Man to look after my Baggage, I parted about nine of the Clock at Night. They told me that there was &s;ome danger of meeting Robbers, but being well Armed, (as my Men al&s;o were,) I was not much concerned; and I cho&s;e rather to run &s;ome little risk, than to mi&s;s an oppertunity of &s;eeing tho&s;e Pagods, which are &s;o renowned all over the <HI>Indies:</HI> We marched &s;oftly becau&s;e of the unevenne&s;s of the Country, and about two of the Clock in the Morning, came near to <HI>Doltabad,</HI> where we re&s;ted till five.</P>
<P>We had a rugged Mountain to a&s;cend, and very hard for the Oxen to climb up, though the way cut out of the Rock, be almo&s;t every where as &s;mooth,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A lovely way in a Mountain.</NOTE> as if it were Paved with Free-&s;tone: It had on the &s;ide a Wall three Foot thick, and four Foot high, to hinder the Waggons and Chariots from falling down into the Plain, if they chanced to be overthrown. My <HI>Pious</HI> thru&s;t forward the Waggon with all their force, and contributed as much as the Oxen to get it up to the top of the Hill. When I arrived there, I di&s;covered a &s;pacious Plain of well cultivated Land, with a great many Villages, and Bourgs amid&s;t Gardens, plenty of Fruit-trees and Woods: We Travelled at lea&s;t for the &s;pace of an hour over Plow'd Land, where I &s;aw very fair Tombs &s;everal &s;tories high, and covered with domes built of large grayi&s;h Stones,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fair Tombs at <HI>Elora.</HI></NOTE> and about half an hour after &s;even, having pa&s;&s;ed by a great <HI>Tanquie,</HI> I alighted near a large Court paved with the &s;ame Stones.

of that In&s;cription is, <HI>In the Name of God.</HI> There was no light into the <HI>Mo&s;que,</HI> but what entered by that Door; but there were many Lamps burning in it, and &s;everal old Men that were there, invited me to come in, which I did. I &s;aw nothing rare in it, but two Tombs covered with Carpet: And I was extreamly troubled for want of an Interpreter, for el&s;e I had known a great many particulars, that I could not be inform|ed of.</P>
<P>A little farther We&s;tward, my <HI>Pions</HI> and I were above half an hour clambering down a Rock, into another very low Plain. The fir&s;t thing I &s;aw were very high Chappels, and I entered into a Porch cut out of the Rock, which is of a dark grayi&s;h Stone, and on each &s;ide of that Porch, there is a Gigantick figure of a Man cut out of the natural Rock,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gigantick Fi|gures of Men cut in the Rock.</NOTE> and the Walls are covered all over with other figures in relief, cut in the &s;ame manner. Having pa&s;&s;ed that Porch, I found a Square Court, an hundred paces e|very way: The Walls are the natural Rock, which in that place is &s;ix Fathom high, Perpendicular to the Ground-plat, and cut as &s;mooth and even, as if it were Pla&s;ter &s;moothed with a Trewel. Before all things, I re&s;olved to view the out&s;ide of that Court, and I perceived that the&s;e Walls, or rather the Rock hangs, and that it is hollowed underneath;<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Gallery in the Rock.</NOTE> &s;o that the void &s;pace makes a Gallery almo&s;t two Fathom high, and four or five broad: It hath the Rock for Ground,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Pillars cut in the Rock.</NOTE> and is &s;upported only by a row of Pillars cut in the Rock, and di&s;tant from the floor of the Gallery, about the length of a Fathom, &s;o that it appears as if there were two Galleries.

At the farther end of the Court, I found two Stair-ca&s;es cut in the Rock, and I went up with a little Bramen, who appeared to have a great deal of Wit: Being at the top, I per|ceived a kind of Platform, (if the &s;pace of a League and a half, or two Leagues, may be called a Platform) full of &s;tately Tombs,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Pagods of <HI>Elora.</HI></NOTE> Chappels and Temples, which they call Pagods, cut in the Rock. The little Bramen led me to all the Pagods, which the &s;mall time I had allowed me to &s;ee: With a Cane he &s;hew'd me all the Figures of the&s;e Pagods, told me their Names, and by &s;ome Indian words which I under&s;tood, I perceived very well, that he gave me a &s;hort account of the Hi&s;tories of them; but &s;eeing he under|&s;tood not the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Tongue, nor I the <HI>Indian,</HI> I could make nothing at all of it.</P>
<P>I entered into a great Temple built in the Rock; it has a flat Roof, and adorned with Figures in the infide, as the Walls of it are:<NOTE PLACE="marg">A great Temple built in the ve|ry Rock.</NOTE> In that Temple there are eight rows of Pillars in length, and &s;ix in breadth, which are a|bout a Fathom di&s;tant from one another.</P>
<P>The Temple is divided into three parts: The Body of it, (which takes up two thirds and a half of the length,) is the fir&s;t part, and is of an equal breadth all over; The Quire, which is narrower, makes the &s;econd part; And the third, which is the end of the Temple, is the lea&s;t, and looks only like a Chappel; in the middle whereof, upon a very high Ba&s;is, there is a Gigantick Idol, with a Head as big as a Drum, and the re&s;t proportionable.<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Gigantick Idol.</NOTE> All the Walls of the Chappel are covered with Gigantick Figures in relief, and on the out&s;ide all round the Temple, there are a great many little Chappels adorned with Figures of an ordinary bigne&s;s in relief,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Figures of Men and Women.</NOTE> repre&s;enting Men and Women, embracing one another.</P>
<P><PB N="76" REF="310">Leaving this place, I went into &s;everal other Temples of different &s;tructure, built al&s;o in the Rock, and full of Figures, Pila&s;ters, and Pillars: I &s;aw three Temples, one over another, which have but one Front all three; but it is divided into three Stories, &s;upported with as many rows of Pillars, and in every Story, there is a great door for the Temple; the Stair-ca&s;es are cut out of the Rock. I &s;aw but one Temple that was Arched, and therein I found a Room, whereof the chief Ornament is a &s;quare Well, cut in the Rock, and full of Spring-water, that ri&s;es within two or three foot of the brim of the Well.

<P>In the&s;e Pagods I &s;aw &s;everal <HI>Santo's</HI> or <HI>Sogues</HI> without Cloaths, except on the parts of the Body which ought to be hid: They were all co|vered with A&s;hes, and I was told that they let their Hair grow as long as it could. If I could have &s;tayed longer in tho&s;e quarters, I &s;hould have &s;een the re&s;t of the Pagods, and u&s;ed &s;o much diligence, as to have found out &s;ome body, that might have exactly informed me of every thing; but it behoved me to re&s;t &s;atisfied as to that, with the information I had from the Gentiles of <HI>Aurangeabad,</HI> who upon my return told me, that the con|&s;tant Tradition was,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The time when the&s;e Pagods were made</NOTE> that all the&s;e Pagods, great and &s;mall with their Works and Ornaments, were made by Giants, but that in what time it was not known.</P>

I &s;pent only two hours in &s;eeing what now I have de&s;cribed, and it may ea&s;ily be judged, that I needed &s;everal days to have examined all the rarities of that place; but &s;eeing I wanted time, and that it behoved me to make ha&s;te, if I intended to find my com|pany &s;till at <HI>Aurangeabad,</HI> I broke off my curio&s;ity, and I mu&s;t confe&s;s it was with regret: I therefore got up into my Waggon again, which I found at a Village called <HI>Rougequi,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Rougequi.

The Town is indifferently big, it reaches from Ea&s;t to We&s;t, and is much longer than broad; it is Walled round with Free-&s;tone, and has Battle|ments and Towers mounted with Cannon. But though the Walls and

This is all I could &s;ee from the place, where I was without the Town: But I learnt afterwards from a Frenchman who had lived two years therein; that be&s;ides the Cita|del, there are three other Forts in the Place, at the foot of the Hill,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Barcot.

There is a Pagod under that Tree, and many Tombs, and hard by a Garden planted with Citron-trees.</P>
<P>We &s;aw a &s;tately <HI>Tanquie</HI> at the Town of <HI>Ambar,</HI> it is &s;quare,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ambar.</NOTE> and on three &s;ides faced with Free-&s;tone, with fair &s;teps to go down to it: In the middle of the fourth &s;ide there is a Divan, that runs out into the Water about two Fathom; it is covered with Stone, and &s;upported by &s;ixteen Pil|lars a Fathom high: It &s;tands at the foot of a fair Hou&s;e, from whence they go down into that Divan, by two fine pair of Stairs at the &s;ides of it, there to take the Air and Divert them&s;elves. Near the Divan there is a little Pagod under Ground, which receives day-light by the door, and by a &s;quare airie, and many Devout People are there, becau&s;e of the conveni|ence of the Water. On the Road we met with a great many Troopers who were going to <HI>Aurangeabad,</HI> where there was a Rendez-vous appointed for an Army, which was to march again&s;t <HI>Viziapour.</HI></P>
<P>Five Leagues from the Town of <HI>Nander,</HI> near a Village called <HI>Patoda,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Nander.</HI> Extraordinary feats of Agility of Body.</NOTE> we had the Diver&s;ion of &s;eeing Feats of Agility of Body: There was a great concour&s;e of People, and we had a place given us, on an Eminence, under the &s;hade of a great Tree, from whence we might ea&s;ily &s;ee all the Plays. The Tumblers did all that the Rope-dancers of <HI>Europe</HI> do, and much more: The&s;e People are a &s;upple as an Eel, they'll turn their whole body into a Bowl, and then others rowl them with the hand. The fine&s;t tricks were performed by a Girl of thirteen or fourteen years of Age, who Played for the &s;pace of two hours and more. This among&s;t other Feats of Agility which &s;he did, appeared to me extreamly difficult: She &s;at down upon the Ground, holding cro&s;s-ways in her Mouth a long cutting Sword; with the right Hand &s;he took hold of her left Foot, brought it up to her Brea&s;t, then to her left &s;ide, and without letting go that Foot, &s;he put her Head underneath her right Arm, and at the &s;ame time, brought her Foot down along the &s;mall of her Back: Then &s;he made it pa&s;s under her &s;itting, and over the right Leg four or five times without re&s;ting, being always in danger of cutting her Arm or Leg with the edge of the Sword: And &s;he did the &s;ame thing with the left Hand and right Foot.</P>
<P><PB N="78" REF="311">Whil'&s;t &s;he was &s;hewing of that trick, they dug a hole in the Ground two foot deep, which they filled with Water. So &s;oon as the Girl had re&s;ted a little, they threw into the hole a little Hook made like a Cla&s;p, for her to fetch out with her No&s;e, without touching it with her Hands: She put her two Feet on the &s;ides of the Pit, and turned her &s;elf backwards, upon her two Hands, which &s;he placed on the &s;ides of the hole where her Feet had &s;tood. Then &s;he dived headlong into the Water, to &s;earch after the Hook with her No&s;e: The fir&s;t time &s;he mi&s;&s;ed it, but the pit being filled full of Water again, &s;he plunged backwards into it a &s;econd time, and upholding her &s;elf only with the left hand, &s;he gave a &s;ign with the right hand, that &s;he had found what &s;he &s;ought for, and &s;he rai&s;ed her &s;elf again with the Cla&s;p at her No&s;e.</P>
<P>Then a Man took this Girl, and &s;etting her upon his Head, ran at full &s;peed through the place, &s;he in the mean time not tottering in the lea&s;t: Setting her down, he took a large Earthen pot, like to tho&s;e round Pitch|ers that the Indian Maids make u&s;e to draw Water in; and put it upon his Head with the mouth upwards. The Girl got on the top of it, and he car|ried her about the place with the &s;ame &s;ecurity, as he had done without the Pot: which he did twice more, having put the Pot with the mouth downwards once, and then with the mouth &s;ide-ways. The &s;ame trick he &s;hewed in a Ba&s;on wherein he turned the Pot three different ways: Then he took the Ba&s;on and turned its bottom up upon his Head, with the Pitch|er over it. The Girl &s;hewed the &s;ame tricks upon it. And at length, having put into the Ba&s;on upon his Head, a little wooden Truncheon a foot high, and as big as ones Arm, he cau&s;ed the Girl to be &s;et upright upon that Stake, and carried her about as before; &s;ometimes &s;he only &s;tood upon one Foot, taking the other in her Hand; and &s;ometimes &s;he hurkled down upon her Heels, nay, and &s;at down, though the carrier in the mean time, went on as formerly. Then the Man took the Ba&s;on from under the Stake, and put it on the top of it, where the Girl likewi&s;e appeared: Then changeing the Play, he put into the Ba&s;on four Pins, or little Stakes of Wood, four Inches high, &s;et &s;quare-ways with a Board upon each of them, two Fingers breadth, and upon the&s;e Boards four other Pins or little Stakes, with as many Boards more, making in all, two Stories over the Ba&s;on, &s;upported with the great Stake or Pillar: And that Girl getting upon the upper Story, he ran with her through the place with the &s;ame &s;wiftne&s;s as at other times, &s;he not appearing in the lea&s;t, afraid of falling, though the Wind was high. The&s;e People &s;hew'd a hundred other tricks of Agility, which I &s;hall not de&s;cribe, that I may not be tedious; only I mu&s;t &s;ay, that the fine&s;t I &s;aw Acted, were performed by Girls. We gave them at par|ting three <HI>Roupies,</HI> for which they gave us a thou&s;and Ble&s;&s;ings: We &s;ent for them at Night to our Camp, where they diverted us again, and gained two <HI>Roupies</HI> more.</P>

<P>When I came down, I perceived at the foot of the Hill, on the Ea&s;t &s;ide, a building, which I was not told of; I went thither alone with my <HI>Pions,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">A fair Building near <HI>Chitana|gar.</HI></NOTE> but found nothing but the beginnings of a Palace, the Walls whereof were of the &s;ame Stone as the Pagod. The Thre&s;hold of each Door is of one piece of Stone, a Fathom and a half long: It is all Built of very great Stones, and I mea&s;ured one of them, that was above four Fathom long. Near to that Building, there is a Re&s;ervatory as broad as the <HI>Seine</HI> at <HI>Paris;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">A very great Re&s;ervatory.</NOTE> but &s;o long, that from the highe&s;t place I went to, I could not di&s;cover the length of it.

<P>This Town hath good Walls, with Towers and great Guns, and the I&s;le it &s;elf is Walled round, with Gates towards the Land, to hinder the Slaves from running away, which they do not fear (towards the Sea) becau&s;e all the little I&s;les and Penin&s;ules that are there, belong to the <HI>Portugue&s;e,</HI> and are full of their Subjects.

It is a great Town, and full of fair Churches, lovely Convents, and Palaces well beautified; there are &s;everal Orders of Religious, both Men and Women there, and the Je&s;uits alone have five publick Hou&s;es; few Nations in the World were &s;o rich in the <HI>Indies</HI> as the <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> were, before their Commerce was ruined by the <HI>Dutch,</HI> but their vanity is the cau&s;e of their lo&s;s; and if they had feared the <HI>Dutch</HI> more than they did, they might have been &s;till in a con|dition to give them the Law there, from which they are far enough at pre&s;ent.</P>

<P>THe mo&s;t powerful of the Kings of <HI>Decan,</HI> next to <HI>Viziapour,</HI> is the King of <HI>Golconda.</HI> His Kingdom borders on the Ea&s;t &s;ide,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Golconda.</NOTE> upon the Sea of <HI>Bengala;</HI> to the North, upon the Mountains of the Countrey of <HI>Orixa;</HI> to the South, upon many Countries of <HI>Bi&s;uagar,</HI> or Ancient <HI>Nar|&s;ingue,</HI> which belongs to the King of <HI>Viziapour;</HI> and to the We&s;t, upon the Empire of the <HI>Great Mogul,</HI> by the province of <HI>Balagate,</HI> where the Village of <HI>Calvar</HI> is, which is the la&s;t place of <HI>Mogoli&s;tan,</HI> on that &s;ide. There are

very in&s;olent collectors of Tolls at <HI>Calvar,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Calvar.</NOTE> and when they have not what they demand,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Li, li, li.</NOTE> they cry with all their force, their <HI>Li, li, li,</HI> &s;triking their Mouth with the palm of their Hand, and at that kind of alarm-bell, which is heard at a great di&s;tance, naked Men come running from all parts, carrying Staves, Lances, Swords, Bows, Arrows, and &s;ome, Mu&s;quets, who make Travellers pay by force what they have demanded, and when all is payed, it is no ea&s;ie matter &s;till to get rid of them.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The bounds of <HI>Mogulistan.

The Nadab or Governour of the Province, lives in the little Town of <HI>Marcel,</HI> and we made that Journey in &s;ix days of Caravan: In &s;hort, there are few or no Countries, that delight Travellers with their verdure, more than the Fields of this Kingdom, becau&s;e of the Rice and Corn that is to be &s;een every where, and the many lovely Re&s;ervatories that are to be found in it.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Bagnagar. Aider-abad.</NOTE>The Capital City of this Kingdom is called <HI>Bagnagar,</HI> the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> call it <HI>Aider-abad;</HI> it is fourteen or fifteen Leagues from <HI>Viziapour,</HI> &s;ituated in the Latitude of &s;eventeen Degrees ten Minutes, in a very long plain, hemmed in with little Hills, &s;ome Coffes di&s;tant from the Town, which makes the Air of that place very whole&s;ome, be&s;ides that, the Countrey of <HI>Golconda</HI> lies very high. The Hou&s;es of the Suburbs, where we arrived, are only built of Earth and thatched with Straw, they are &s;o low and ill contrived, that they can be reckoned no more than Huts. We went from one end to the other of that Suburbs, which is very long, and &s;topt near the Bridge which is at the farther end of it. There we &s;tayed for a note from the <HI>Cotoual</HI> to enter the Town, becau&s;e of the Merchants Goods of the Caravan, which were to be carried to the <HI>Cotouals</HI> Hou&s;e to be &s;earched: But a <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> named <HI>Ak-Nazar,</HI> a favorite of the Kings, who knew the chief of the Caravan, being informed of its arrival, &s;ent imme|diately a Man with orders, to let us enter with all the Goods, and &s;o we pa&s;t the Bridge, which is only three Arches over. It is about three Fathom broad,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nerva.</NOTE> and is paved with large flat Stones: The River of <HI>Nerva</HI> runs under that Bridge, which then &s;eemed to be but a Brook, though in time of the Rains, it be as broad as the <HI>Seine</HI> before the <HI>Louvre</HI> at <HI>Paris.</HI> At the end of the Bridge, we found the Gates of the City, which are no more but Bar|riers: Being entered, we marched a quarter of an hour through a long Street with Hou&s;es on both &s;ides, but as low as tho&s;e of the Suburbs, and built of the &s;ame materials, though they have very lovely Gardens.</P>
<P>We went to a <HI>Carvan&s;eray</HI> called <HI>Nimet-ulla,</HI> which has its entry from the &s;ame Street: Every one took his lodging there, and I hired two little Cham|bers, at two <HI>Roupies</HI> a Month. The Town makes a kind of Cro&s;s, much longer than broad, and extends in a &s;treight line, from the Bridge to the four Towers; but beyond the&s;e Towers the Street is no longer &s;treight, and whil'&s;t in walking I mea&s;ured the length of the Town, being come to the
<PB N="95" REF="321">
four Towers, I was obliged to turn to the left, and entered into a <HI>Meidan,</HI> where there is another Street that led me to the Town-Gate, which I look|ed for. Having adju&s;ted my mea&s;ures, I found that <HI>Bagnagar</HI> was five thou&s;and &s;ix hundred and fifty Paces in length, to wit, two thou&s;and four hundred and fifty from the Bridge to the Towers, and from thence, through the <HI>Meidan</HI> to the Gate which leads to <HI>Ma&s;ulipatan,</HI> three thou&s;and two hundred Paces. There is al&s;o beyond that Gate, a Suburbs eleven hundred Paces long.</P>
<P>There are &s;everal <HI>Meidans</HI> or Publick places in this Town,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Meidan</HI> of <HI>Bagnagar.</HI></NOTE> but the faire&s;t is that before the Kings Palace: It hath to the Ea&s;t and We&s;t two great Di|vans very deep in the Ground, the Roof whereof being of Carpenters work, is rai&s;ed five Fathom high, upon four Wooden Pillars; this Roof is flat, and hath Bali&s;ters of Stone ca&s;t over Arch-ways, with Turrets at the cor|ners. The&s;e two Divans &s;erve for Tribunals to the <HI>Cotoual,</HI> who&s;e Pri&s;ons are at the bottom of the&s;e Divans, each of them having a Ba&s;on of Water before them. The like Bali&s;ters go round the Terra&s;s-walks of the place: The Royal Palace is to the North of it, and there is a Portico over again&s;t it, where the Mu&s;icians come &s;everal times a day to play upon their In&s;tru|ments, when the King is in Town.</P>
<P>In the middle of this place, and in &s;ight of the Royal Palace, there is a Wall built, three Foot thick, and &s;ix Fathom in height and length,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fightings of Elephants.</NOTE> for the fighting of Elephants, and that Wall is betwixt them, when they ex|cite them to fight; but &s;o &s;oon as they are wrought up to a rage, they quick|ly throw down the Wall. The ordinary Hou&s;es there, are not above two Fathom high; they rai&s;e them no higher, that they may have the fre&s;h Air during the heats, and mo&s;t part of them are only of Earth; but the Hou&s;es of Per&s;ons of Quality are pretty enough.</P>
<P>The Palace which is three hundred and four&s;core Paces in length, takes up not only one of the &s;ides of the Place,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Palace of <HI>Bagnagar.</HI></NOTE> but is continued to the four Towers, where it terminates in a very loftly Pavillion. The Walls of it which are built of great Stones, have at certain di&s;tances half Towers, and there are many Windows towards the place, with an open Gallery to &s;ee the &s;hews. They &s;ay it is very plea&s;ant within, and that the Water ri&s;es to the highe&s;t Appartments: The Re&s;ervatory of that Water, which is brought a great way off, is in the top of the four Towers, from whence it is conveyed into the Hou&s;e by Pipes. No Man enters into this Palace, but by an expre&s;s Order from the King, who grants it but &s;eldom; nay, com|monly no body comes near it, and in the place there is a circuit &s;taked out, that mu&s;t not be pa&s;&s;ed over. There is another &s;quare <HI>Meidan</HI> in this Town, where many great Men have well built Hou&s;es. The <HI>Carvan&s;eras</HI> are gene|rally all hand&s;ome, and the mo&s;t e&s;teemed is that which is called <HI>Nimet-ulla</HI> in the great Street oppo&s;ite to the Kings Garden: It is a &s;pacious &s;quare, and the Court of it is adorned with &s;everal Trees of different kinds, and a large Ba&s;on where the <HI>Mahometans</HI> performe their Ablutions.</P>
<P>That which is called the four Towers, is a &s;quare building,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The four Tow|ers.</NOTE> of which each face is ten Fathom broad, and about &s;even high: It is opened in the four &s;ides, by four Arches, four or five Fathom high, and four Fathom wide, and every one of the&s;e Arches fronts a Street, of the &s;ame breadth as the Arch. There are two Galleries in it, one over another, and over all a Terra&s;s that &s;erves for a Roof, bordered with a Stone-Balcony; and at each corner of that Building, a Decagone Tower about ten Fathom high, and each Tower hath four Galleries, with little Arches on the out&s;ide; the whole Building being adorned with Ro&s;es and Fe&s;tons pretty well cut: It is vaulted underneath, and appears like a Dome, which has in the in&s;ide all round Bali&s;ters of Stone, pierced and open as the Galleries in the out&s;ide, and there are &s;everal Doors in the Walls to enter at. Under this Dome there is a large Table placed upon a Divan, rai&s;ed &s;even or eight Foot from the Ground, with &s;teps to go up to it. All the Galleries of that Building, &s;erve to make the Water mount up, that &s;o being afterwards conveyed to the Kings Palace, it might reach the highe&s;t Appartments. Nothing in that Town &s;eems &s;o lovely as the out&s;ide of that Building, and
<PB N="96" REF="322">
neverthele&s;s it is &s;urrounded with ugly &s;hops made of Wood, and covered with Straw, where they &s;ell Fruit, which &s;poiles the pro&s;pect of it.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Gardens near <HI>Bagnagar.</HI></NOTE>There are many fair Gardens in this Town, their beauty con&s;i&s;ts in ha|ving long walks kept very clean, and lovely Fruit-trees; but they have neither Beds of Flowers nor Water-works, and they are &s;atisfied with &s;e|veral Ci&s;terns or Ba&s;ons with Water. The Gardens without the Town are the lovelie&s;t, and I &s;hall only de&s;cribe one of them, that is reckoned the plea&s;ante&s;t of the Kingdom. At fir&s;t one enters into a great place which is called the fir&s;t Garden; it is planted with Palms and <HI>Areca</HI> trees, &s;o near to one another, that the Sun can hardly pierce through them. The Walks of it are &s;treight and neat, with borders of white Flowers which they call <HI>Ghoul Daouds, the Flowers of</HI> David, like Camomile-Flowers; there are al&s;o <HI>Indian</HI> Gilly-flowers, with &s;ome other &s;orts. The Hou&s;e is at the end of this Garden, and has two great Wings adjoyning the main Body of it: It is two Story high, the fir&s;t con&s;i&s;ting in three Halls, of which the greate&s;t is in the middle, the main Body of the Hou&s;e, and in each Wing there is one, all three having Doors and Windows, but the great Hall has two Doors, higher than the others, which open into a large <HI>Kioch</HI> or Divan, &s;upported by eight great Pillars in two rows. Cro&s;&s;ing the Hall and Divan, one goes down a pair of Stairs into another Divan of the &s;ame form, but longer, which (as the former) hath a Room on each &s;ide, open|ed with Doors and Windows. The &s;econd Story of the Building is like the fir&s;t, &s;ave that it hath but one Divan; but it hath a Balcony that reaches the whole length of that front of it. The Hou&s;e is covered with a flat Roof of &s;o great extent, that it reaches over the outmo&s;t Divan of the low|er Story, and is &s;upported by &s;ix eight-cornered Wooden Pillars, &s;ix or &s;even Fathom high, and proportionably big.</P>
<P>From the lower Divan, a Terra&s;s-walk two hundred Paces long, and fifty broad, faced with Stones runs along all the Front of the Hou&s;e; and two little groves of Trees, that are on the &s;ides of it. This Terra&s;s that is at the head of the &s;econd Garden, (which is much larger than the fir&s;t,) is rai&s;ed a Fathom and a halfe above it, and has very neat Stairs for going down into it. The fir&s;t thing that is to be &s;een (looking forwards,) is a great &s;quare Re&s;ervatory or <HI>Tanquie,</HI> each &s;ide whereof is above two hun|dred Paces long; in it there are a great many Pipes that ri&s;e half a Foot above Water, and a Bridge upon it, rai&s;ed about a Foot over the &s;urface of the Water, and above &s;ix Foot broad, with wooden Railes. This Bridge is four&s;core Paces long, and leads into a Platform of an Octogone figure in the middle of the Re&s;ervatory, where there are Steps to de&s;cend into the Water, which is but about a Foot lower than the Platform: There are Pipes in the eight Angles of it, and in the Pillars of the Railes, from whence the Water plays on all &s;ides, which makes a very lovely &s;ight. In the middle of the Platform there is a little Hou&s;e built two Stories high, and of an Octogone figure al&s;o; each Story hath a little Room with eight Doors, and round the &s;econd Story there is a Balcony to walk in: The Roof of this Building which is flat, is bordered with Bali&s;ters, and covers the whole Platform al&s;o: That Roof is &s;upported by &s;ixteen woodden Pil|lars, as big as a Mans Body, and about three Fathom high, (if you com|prehend their Capitals,) and there are two of them at each Angle, of which one re&s;ts upon the Wall of the Hou&s;e, and the other is near the Railes that go round it.</P>
<P>The Garden wherein this Re&s;ervatory is, is planted with Flowers and Fruit-trees: All are in very good order, and in this, as well as in the fir&s;t Garden, there are lovely Walks well Gravelled, and Bordered with divers Flowers: There runs a Canal in the middle of the great Walk, which is four Foot over, and carries away what it receives from &s;everal little Foun|tains of Water, that are al&s;o in the middle of that Walk, at certain di|&s;tances: In &s;hort, this Garden is very large, and bounded by a Wall which hath a great Gate in the middle that opens into a Clo&s;e of a large extent, Planted with Fruit-trees, and as nearly contrived as the Gardens.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. V.</HI> Of the Inhabitants of <HI>Bagnagar.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THere are many Officers and Men of Law at <HI>Bagnagar,</HI> but the mo&s;t con&s;iderable is the <HI>Cotoual:</HI> He is not only Governour of the Town,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Inhabi|tants of <HI>Bag|nagar.</HI></NOTE> but al&s;o chief Cu&s;tomer of the Kingdom. He is be&s;ides, Ma&s;ter of the Mint-hou&s;e, and Supream Judge of the City, as well in Civil as Criminal matters; he rents all the&s;e places of the King, for which he pays a good deal of Money. There are in this Town many Rich Merchants, Bankers and Jewellers, and va&s;t numbers of very skilful Arti&s;ans. Among&s;t the Inhabitants of <HI>Bagnagar,</HI> we are to recken the forty thou&s;and Hor&s;e, <HI>Per|&s;ians, Moguls,</HI> or <HI>Tartars,</HI> whom the King entertains, that he may not be again &s;urpri&s;ed, as he hath been heretofore by his Enemies.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the <HI>Indian</HI> Merchants that are at <HI>Bagnagar,</HI> there are many <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> and <HI>Armenians,</HI> but through the weakne&s;s of the Government, the <HI>Omras</HI> &s;ometimes &s;queeze them; and whil'&s;t I was there, an <HI>Omra</HI> detained in his Hou&s;e a Gentile Banker whom he had &s;ent for, and made him give him five thou&s;and <HI>Chequins;</HI> upon the report of this Extortion, the Bankers &s;hut up their Offices, but the King Commanded all to be re&s;tored to the Gentile, and &s;o the matter was taken up.</P>
<P>The Trade&s;men of the Town, and tho&s;e who cultivate the Land, are Natives of the Country. There are many Franks al&s;o in the Kingdome, but mo&s;t of them are <HI>Portugue&s;e,</HI> who have fled thither for Crimes they have committed: However the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and <HI>Dutch</HI> have lately &s;etled there, and the la&s;t make great profits. They e&s;tabli&s;hed a Factory there, (three years &s;ince) where they buy up for the Company, may <HI>Chites</HI> and other Cloaths, which they vent el&s;ewhere in the <HI>Indies.</HI> They bring from <HI>Ma&s;ulipatan</HI> up|on Oxen, the Goods which they know to be of readie&s;t &s;ale in <HI>Bagnagar;</HI> and other Towns of the Kingdom, as Cloves, Pepper, Cinnamon, Silver, Copper, Tin, and Lead, and thereby gain very much; for they &s;ay, they get five an twenty for one, of profit; and I was a&s;&s;ured that this profit a|mounted yearly to eleven or twelve hundred thou&s;and French <HI>Livres.</HI> They are made welcome in that Countrey, becau&s;e they make many Pre&s;ents, and a few days before I parted from <HI>Bagnagar,</HI> their Governour began to have Trumpets and Tymbals, and a Standard carried before him, by Orders from his Superiours.</P>
<P>Publick Women are allowed in the Kingdom, &s;o that no body minds it when they &s;ee a Man go to their Hou&s;es,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Publick Wo|men.</NOTE> and they are often at their Doors well dre&s;t, to draw in Pa&s;&s;engers: But they &s;ay, mo&s;t of them are &s;poiled.

<P>When a Theft is committed at <HI>Bagnagar,</HI> or el&s;ewhere, they puni&s;h the Thief by cutting off both his Hands; which is the Cu&s;tome al&s;o in mo&s;t Countries of the <HI>Indies.</HI></P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Golconda</HI> a Ca&s;tle.</NOTE>THe Ca&s;tle where the King commonly keeps his Court, is two Leagues from <HI>Bagnagar;</HI> it is called <HI>Golconda,</HI> and the Kingdom bears the &s;ame name. <HI>Cotup-Cha</HI> the fir&s;t, gave it that name, becau&s;e after his U&s;urpa|tion &s;eeking out for a place where he might build a &s;trong Ca&s;tle, the place where the Ca&s;tle &s;tands was named to him by a Shepheard, who guided him through a Wood to the Hill where the Palace is at pre&s;ent; and the place appearing very proper for his de&s;igne, he built the Ca&s;tle there, and called it <HI>Golconda,</HI> from the word <HI>Golcar,</HI> which in the <HI>Telenghi</HI> Language &s;ignifies a Shepheard: all the Fields about <HI>Golconda</HI> were then but a Fore&s;t, which were cleared by little and little, and the Wood burnt. This place is to the We&s;t of <HI>Bagnagar;</HI> the plain that leads to it, as one goes out of the Suburbs, affords a mo&s;t lovely &s;ight, to which the pro&s;pect of the Hill that ri&s;es like a Sugar-loaf in the middle of the Ca&s;tle, which has the Kings Palace all round upon the &s;ides of it, contributes much by its natural &s;itu|ation. This Fort is of a large compa&s;s, and may be called a Town; the Walls of it are built of Stones three Foot in length, and as much in breadth, and are &s;urrounded with deep Ditches, divided into <HI>Tanquies,</HI> which are full of fair and good Water.</P>
<P>But after all, it hath no works of Fortification but five round Towers, which (as well as the Walls of the place) have a great many Cannon mount|ed upon them, for their defence. Though there be &s;everal Gates into this Ca&s;tle, yet two only are kept open, and as we entered, we cro&s;&s;ed over a Bridge built over a large <HI>Tanquie,</HI> and then went through a very narrow place betwixt two Towers, which turning and winding, leads to a great

Be&s;ides the Kings Palace there is no good building in this Ca&s;tle, unle&s;s it be &s;ome Officers lodgings; but the Palace is great, and well &s;ituated for good Air, and a lovely Pro&s;pect; and a <HI>Flemi&s;h</HI> Chirurgeon who is in the Kings &s;ervice, told me, that the Chamber where he waited on the King, hath a <HI>Kiock,</HI> from whence one may di&s;cover not only all the Ca&s;tle and Countrey about, but al&s;o all <HI>Bagnagar,</HI> and that one mu&s;t pa&s;s through twelve Gates before one comes to the appartment of the Prince.

<P>The King will have the good Workmen to live there, and therefore ap|points them lodgings, for which they pay nothing: He makes even Jewellers lodge in his Palace, and to the&s;e only he tru&s;ts Stones of con&s;equence, &s;trict|ly charging them not to tell any what work they are about, lea&s;t if <HI>Auran-Zeb</HI> &s;hould come to know that his workmen are employed about Stones of great value, he might demand them of him: The Workmen of the Ca|&s;tle are taken up about the Kings common Stones, of which he hath &s;o many that the&s;e Men can hardly work for any body el&s;e.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The cutting of Saphirs.</NOTE></P>

<P>The Sepulchres of the King who built <HI>Golconda,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Sepulchres of the Kings and Princes of <HI>Golconda.</HI></NOTE> and of the five Princes who have Reigned after him, are about two Mu&s;quet-&s;hot from the Ca&s;tle. They take up a great deal of Ground, becau&s;e every one of them is in a large Garden; the way to go thither is out at the We&s;t Gate, and by it not only the Bodies of Kings and Princes, but of all that die in the Ca&s;tle are carried out; and no intere&s;t can prevail to have them conveyed out by any other Gate. The Tombs of the &s;ix Kings are accompanied with tho&s;e of their Relations, their Wives, and chief Eunuchs. Every one of them is in the middle of a Garden; and to go &s;ee them, one mu&s;t a&s;cend by five or &s;ix &s;teps to a walk built of tho&s;e Stones, which re&s;emble the <HI>Theban.</HI> The Chappel which contains the Tomb is &s;urrounded by a Gallery with open Arches: It is &s;quare, and rai&s;ed &s;ix or &s;even Fathom high; it is beau|tified with many Ornaments of Architecture, and covered with a Dome, that at each of the four corners has a Turret; few people are &s;uffered to go in, becau&s;e the&s;e places are accounted Sacred. There are <HI>Santo's</HI> who keep the entry, and I could not have got in, if I had not told them that I was a Stranger. The floor is covered with a Carpet, and on the Tomb there is a Satten Pall with white Flowers, that trails upon the Ground. There is a Cloath of State of the &s;ame Stuff a Fathom high, and all is lighted with many Lamps. The Tombs of the Sons and Daughters of the King are on the one &s;ide, and on the other all that Kings Books, on folding &s;eats,
<PB N="100" REF="324">
which for the mo&s;t part are <HI>Alcorans</HI> with their Commentaries, and &s;ome other Books of the <HI>Mahometan</HI> Religion. The Tombs of the other Kings are like to this, &s;ave only that the Chappels of &s;ome are &s;quare in the in|&s;ide as on the out&s;ide, and of others built in form of a Cro&s;s; &s;ome are lined with that lovely Stone I have mentioned, others with black Stone, and &s;ome others with white, &s;o Varni&s;hed as that they appear to be Poli&s;h|ed Marble, nay, &s;ome of them are lined with Pur&s;lane. The Tomb of the King that died la&s;t is the fine&s;t of all, and its Dome is Varni&s;hed over with Green. The Tombs of the Princes their Brothers, of their other Re|lations, and of their Wives al&s;o, are of the &s;ame form as their own are; but they are ea&s;ily to be di&s;tingui&s;hed, becau&s;e their Domes have not the cre&s;cent which is upon the Domes of the Monuments of the Kings. The Sepulchres of the chief Eunuchs are low and flat Roofed without any Dome, but have each of them their Garden: All the&s;e Sepulchres are Sanctuaries, and how criminal &s;oever a Man may be that can get into them, he is &s;ecure. The <HI>Gary</HI> is rung there as well as in the Ca&s;tle, and all things are mo&s;t ex|actly regulated among&s;t the Officers.

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. VII.</HI> Of the King of <HI>Golconda</HI> that Reigns.</HEAD>
<P>THe King that Reigns is a <HI>Chiai</HI> by Religion, that's to &s;ay, of the Sect of the <HI>Per&s;ians;</HI> he is the &s;eventh &s;ince the U&s;urpation made upon the Succe&s;&s;our of <HI>Chaalem</HI> King of <HI>Decan,</HI> and he is called <HI>Abdulla Cotup-Cha.</HI> I have already ob&s;erved, that the name of all the Kings of <HI>Golconda</HI> is <HI>Cotup-Cha,</HI> as <HI>Edel-Cha</HI> is the name of the Kings of <HI>Viziapour.</HI> This King is the Son of a <HI>Bramen</HI> Lady, who hath had other Princes al&s;o by the late King her Husband, and was very witty. He was but fifteen years of Age when his Father (who left the Crown to his Elde&s;t Son) died; but the Elde&s;t be|ing le&s;s beloved of the Queen than <HI>Abdulla</HI> his younger Brother, he was clapt up in Pri&s;on, and <HI>Abdulla</HI> placed upon the Throne. He continued in Pri&s;on until the year One thou&s;and &s;ix hundred fifty eight; when <HI>Auran-Zeb</HI> com|ing into the Kingdom with an Army, the captive Prince had the boldne&s;s to &s;end word to the King, that if he plea&s;ed to give him the command of his Forces, he would meet the <HI>Mogul</HI> and fight him. The King was &s;tartled at that bold propo&s;al, and was &s;o far from granting him what he deman|ded, that he cau&s;ed him to be poy&s;oned.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The number of Soldiers.</NOTE>The King of <HI>Golconda</HI> pays above Five hundred thou&s;and Soldiers; and that makes the Riches of the <HI>Omras,</HI> becau&s;e he who has Pay for a thou&s;and Men, entertains but Five hundred, and &s;o do the re&s;t proportionably. He allows a Trooper (who ought to be either a <HI>Mogul</HI> or <HI>Per&s;ian</HI>) ten <HI>Chequins</HI> a month, and for that Pay, he ought to keep two Hor&s;es and four or five Servants. A Foot-Soldier (of the&s;e Nations) hath five <HI>Chequins,</HI> and ought to entertain two Servants, and carry a Musket. He gives not the <HI>Indians</HI> (his own Subjects) above two or three Roupies a month, and the&s;e carry only the Lance and Pike. Seeing the late King gave his Soldiers better Pay than this do's, he was far better &s;erved: He entertained always a &s;trong Ar|my, and the number of Men he payed was always compleat. By that
<PB N="101" REF="324">
means he ea&s;ily hindred the <HI>Great Mogul</HI> from attempting any thing again&s;t him, and was not tributary to him as his Son is.</P>
<P>Heretofore the King went ever now and then to his Palace of <HI>Bagnagar,</HI> but he hath not been there this eight years; &s;ince <HI>Auran-Zeb</HI> (who was then but Governour of a Province) &s;urprized him in it, having marched his Forces with &s;o great diligence, that they were at the Gates of <HI>Bagnagar,</HI> be|fore the King had any News that they were marched from <HI>Aurangeabad,</HI> &s;o that he ea&s;ily made him&s;elf Ma&s;ter of the Town: Neverthele&s;s, the King in di&s;gui&s;e, e&s;caped by a private door, and retreated to the Fort of <HI>Gol|conda.</HI> The <HI>Mogul</HI> plundered the Town and Palace, carrying away all the Riches, even to the Plates of Gold, wherewith the Fleors of the Kings ap|partment were covered. The Queen Mother (at length) had the Art to ap|pea&s;e the Conquerour; &s;he treated with him in name of the King, and granted him one of his Daughters in Marriage for his Son, with promi&s;e that he &s;hould leave the Kingdom to him, if he had no Male i&s;&s;ue, and he hath none. Had it not been for that Accommodation, he was upon the point of lo&s;ing his Kingdom, and perhaps his life too. Since that time he is apprehen&s;ive of every thing; and next to the Queen mother, he tru&s;ts no body but <HI>Sidy Mezafer</HI> (his favourite) and the <HI>Bramens,</HI> becau&s;e that Queen is of the <HI>Bramen</HI> Ca&s;tle, and continually &s;urrounded by them. The King knows of nothing but by them, and there are &s;ome appointed to hearken to what the <HI>Vizier</HI> him&s;elf, and other Officers have to &s;ay to the King; but his fear is much encrea&s;ed &s;ince the <HI>Great Mogul</HI> hath been in War with the King of <HI>Viziapour,</HI> whom in the beginning he a&s;&s;i&s;ted with Two hundred thou&s;and Men, commanded by an Eunuch, who was almo&s;t as &s;oon recalled as &s;ent, upon the complaints made by the <HI>Moguls</HI> Emba&s;&s;adour at <HI>Golconda.</HI> The King (to excu&s;e him&s;elf) &s;aid, that that Army was &s;ent without his knowledge; and he is &s;till in great apprehen&s;ion of having the <HI>Moguls</HI> upon his back, if they &s;ucceed again&s;t the King of <HI>Viziapour,</HI> who hath hitherto defended him&s;elf very bravely. This &s;hews the weakne&s;s of that King; he dares not put to death his <HI>Omras,</HI> even when they de&s;erve it; and if he find them guilty of any Crime, he condemns them only to pay a Fine, and takes the Money. Nay, the <HI>Dutch</HI> begin to in&s;ult over him, and it is not long &s;ince they obliged him to abandon to them an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Ship, which they had &s;eized in the Road of <HI>Ma&s;ulipatan,</HI> though he had undertaken to protect her.</P>
<P>There is a Prince al&s;o at his Court, who begins to create him a great deal of trouble, and it is he whom they call the Kings little Son-in-law, who hath married the third of the Prince&s;&s;es his Daughters, becau&s;e he is of the Blood Royal: He pretends to the Crown, what promi&s;e &s;oever hath been made to the <HI>Great Mogul;</HI> he makes him&s;elf to be &s;erved as the King him|&s;elf is, who hitherto loved him very tenderly; but at pre&s;ent he is jealous of that Son-in-law as well as of the re&s;t, and fancies that he intends to de&s;troy him, that he him&s;elf may Reign, tho' he be reckoned a Man of great in|tegrity. There was in <HI>Bagnagar</HI> a Moori&s;h <HI>Santo</HI> that lived near the Car|van&s;ery of <HI>Nimet-Ulla,</HI> who was held in great veneration by the <HI>Mahometans;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">A Moori&s;h <HI>Santo.</HI></NOTE> the Hou&s;e he lived in was built for him by a great <HI>Omra,</HI> but he kept his Windows &s;hut all day, and never opened them till towards the Evening, to give his Benedictions to a great many people, who asked them with cries, pro&s;tating them&s;elves, and ki&s;&s;ing the ground in his pre&s;ence. Mo&s;t part of the <HI>Omras</HI> vi&s;ited that cheat every evening; and when he went abroad (which happened &s;eldom) he went in a <HI>Palanquin,</HI> where he &s;hewed him|&s;elf &s;tark naked after the <HI>Indian</HI> fa&s;hion, and the People reverenced him as a Saint. The great Lords made him Pre&s;ents, and in the Court of his Hou&s;e he had an Elephant chained, which was given him by a great <HI>Omra.</HI> Whil'&s;t I was on my Journey to <HI>Carnates,</HI> the Kings little Son-in-law gave to this <HI>Santo</HI> a great many Jewels belonging to the Prince&s;s his Wife, Daughter to the King; and &s;ince no Man knew the motive of &s;o great a Pre&s;ent, which perhaps was only &s;ome Super&s;titious Devotion, it was pre&s;ently given out that it was to rai&s;e Forces again&s;t the King, that with the concurrence of the <HI>Santo</HI> he might invade the Crown.

<P>The&s;e <HI>Omras</HI> generally make a very hand&s;ome Figure; when they go through the Town, an Elephant or two goes before them, on which three Men carrying Banners are mounted; fifty or &s;ixty Troopers well cloathed, and riding on <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> or <HI>Tartarian</HI> Hor&s;es, with Bows and Arrows, Swords by their &s;ides, and Bucklers on their backs, follow them at &s;ome di&s;tance; and after the&s;e come other Men on Hor&s;e-back, &s;ounding Trumpets, and playing on Fifes.</P>
<P><PB N="103" REF="325">After them comes the <HI>Omra</HI> on Hor&s;e-back, with thirty or forty Foot-men about him, &s;ome making way, others carrying Lances, and &s;ome with fine Napkins driving away the Flies.

The <HI>Palanquin</HI> carried by four Men, comes next with two other Porters for change; and all this pomp is brought up by a Camel or two, with Men beating of Timbals on their backs.</P>
<P>When the <HI>Omra</HI> plea&s;es, he takes his <HI>Palanquin,</HI> and then his Hor&s;e is led by him.

<P>The King of <HI>Candis</HI> (in the I&s;le of <HI>Ceilan</HI>) is always an enemy to the <HI>Dutch;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The King of <HI>Candis.</HI></NOTE> the cau&s;e of that Enmity is, That this Prince having a&s;&s;i&s;ted them to drive the <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> out of the places they po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in <HI>Ceilan,</HI> they u&s;ed him as an Enemy after they had taken <HI>Colombo;</HI> which made him &s;ay <HI>That he had cha|&s;ed away the Dogs to bring in the Lions;</HI> they defeated his Forces, and he had no way to &s;ave his life but by flight. He is a learned King, under&s;tands &s;e|veral Languages, and is very liberal; it is &s;aid in the Countrey that he is va&s;tly rich, but that no body but him&s;elf knows where his Trea&s;ure is, be|cau&s;e, when he thinks fit to go thither to put in or take out any thing, he takes no body with him but a <HI>Moor,</HI> whom he kills on his return, lea&s;t he may di&s;cover the place where his Riches are.</P>

The Tree is produced after this manner, There is a kind of Birds in the I&s;land, that having picked of the green Husk &s;wallow the Nuts, which ha|ving been &s;ometime in their Stomach, they void by the ordinary way; and they fail not to take rooting in the place where they fall, and in time to grow up to a Tree.

<P><PB N="110" REF="329"><NOTE PLACE="marg">Of <HI>Japan.</HI></NOTE>A friend of mine at <HI>Surrat</HI> gave me a &s;hort relation of the Affairs of the <HI>Dutch</HI> in <HI>Japan,</HI> which I look upon to be curious enough to de&s;erve a place here. It &s;ays, that after the horrible Per&s;ecution of the Chri&s;tians in that Kingdom; the <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> (by the artifice of the <HI>Dutch</HI>) having been depri|ved of their Trade, the Emperour of that Countrey &s;uffered the la&s;t comers to take the place of the <HI>Portugue&s;e;</HI> but fearing le&s;t that if he gave them too much liberty, they might abu&s;e it; he ordered them to live in a little Penin|&s;ule (called <HI>Di&s;ima,</HI>) which is at the bottom of a Channel, near the Town of <HI>Man&s;aque,</HI> which in &s;ome Relations of the Je&s;uits is termed <HI>Manga&s;aquy.</HI> This Penin&s;ule is about two thou&s;and Paces in circuit; they go to the Town by a point of Land, and on another &s;ide there is a Bridge. The <HI>Dutch</HI> have built Hou&s;es there of Stones, which they brought from <HI>Batavia;</HI> but they are forbidden to bind them with any Mortar or Ciment; and they have ob|tained no more liberty but to Pile them up one upon another, to hinder People only from &s;eeing what they are doing at home; yet they cut and po|li&s;h them &s;o ingeniou&s;ly, that their dry Walls are as good as if they were built with Mortar. They have made two Streets and three publick Gates, but they do nothing but what the Governour of the Town knows, either by Spies, or by Guards he &s;ets at the Gates, whom he obliges every evening to give him an account of what pa&s;&s;es in the day-time; and the&s;e Guards are chang'd every day.</P>
<P>None of the <HI>Dutch</HI> dare go out of the Penin&s;ule without the Governours leave, under pain of being cut; they dare not &s;o much as have a Candle lighted in the night-time, nor make the lea&s;t noi&s;e; and if the Guard hear any, they blow a Horn, and immediately the Governour &s;ends a Com|mi&s;&s;ary to know what news there is; this Commi&s;&s;ary goes into the Streets, makes enquiry, and leaves not the Penin&s;ule till he knew who made the noi&s;e, and why? And he has Orders to check, not only tho&s;e that made it, but al&s;o tho&s;e who are appointed to keep all things quiet and in order. In this con&s;traint the <HI>Dutch</HI> live during eight months of the year.</P>
<P>When the <HI>Mou&s;on</HI> or Sea&s;on (for &s;ailing upon the&s;e Seas) is come, the Governour places Sentinels upon hills to di&s;cover the <HI>Dutch</HI> Fleet. So &s;oon as ever it appears, they give him advice, and he &s;peedily &s;ends, out towards the Fleet as many Boats and Waiters as there are Ships &s;een; no &s;ooner are they brought into Port, but the Governour &s;ends notice of it to the Empe|rour by Expre&s;&s;es, (for they have regulated Po&s;ts) and the <HI>Dutch</HI> cannot di&s;|po&s;e of any thing before the return of tho&s;e Expre&s;&s;es. In the mean time they make Inventories of what is on Board the Ships; each Waiter takes one in the Ship that is a&s;&s;igned to him; and the <HI>Dutch</HI> Captain is obliged to write down the Name, Age, Stature and Office of all the Men in his Ship, and to give that Li&s;t of them to the Waiter, that he may &s;end to have it Tran&s;lated into the Language of the Countrey: When one of the Couriers is comeback from Court, the <HI>Dutch</HI> go a-Shoar one after another, accord|ing to the order and rank of the Ships wherein they &s;erve: The fir&s;t Ships crew go a-Shoar fir&s;t, and then the re&s;t in order; all are Mu&s;tered before the Commi&s;&s;aries; and the <HI>Dutch</HI> Clerk who has the Li&s;t, and the Secre|tary or Japane&s;e Clerk that has the Tran&s;lation of it, name them aloud ac|cording as they pa&s;s, and tell their Quality, Age, Stature and Office.</P>
<P>After they have been thus examined a-Shoar, they are put on Board a|gain; the Yards are lower'd, and the Sails, Arms, Guns and Powder of the Ship are carried a-Shoar; the Hatches are &s;hut, and &s;ealed up, with a Seal put upon a piece of Paper, tied with Straw, whereon they ca&s;t a certain knot, which the <HI>Japane&s;e</HI> alone can untie; and the Carpenter of the Ship covers the&s;e Seals with Boxes of Wood, for fear they &s;hould be broken when they wa&s;h the Ship, or are about any other bu&s;ine&s;s; but there is &s;uch a con&s;traint upon all the Crew, that if any one &s;tand in need of a bit of Meat or any other thing that is in the hold, he cannot have it without a particu|lar permi&s;&s;ion from the Governour him&s;elf, who &s;ends a Man expre&s;s to open the Hatches, and go below decks with the <HI>Dutch;</HI> after which he a|gain &s;huts and &s;eals them up.</P>
<P>They are neither permitted to light a Candle nor make a noi&s;e on Ship-board,
<PB N="111" REF="329">
no more than on Shoar in the Penin&s;ule, nor is one Ve&s;&s;el allowed to have any communication with another: No Man is &s;uffered to go a-Shoar, no not the Officers them&s;elves; &s;o that it is a great joy to them to be deput|ed to carry the Emperour (who re&s;ides in the Town of <HI>Yonde,</HI> which &s;ome Relations call <HI>Yando,</HI>) the Pre&s;ent which the States make him yearly; but they are conducted under a good Guard, and when they have made their Pre&s;ent, and the Emperour hath given them another for the States, they are conducted back to their Ship, and they employ three months and a half in making that Journey.</P>
<P>I have been informed by a <HI>Dutch</HI> Commander, who hath accompanied that Pre&s;ent, that the Emperours Palace is as large as a little Town;<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Palace of the Empe|rour of <HI>Japan.</HI></NOTE> that the <HI>Dutch</HI> &s;alute the Emperour on the knee with their hands joyned, and that they make the &s;ame &s;ubmi&s;&s;ions to the Governours; and other great Lords of <HI>Japan.</HI> The <HI>Japane&s;e</HI> have no more liberty (in relation to the Fleet) than the <HI>Dutch</HI> have. None of them dare go on Board a Ship to buy and &s;ell be|fore the appointed time, and it they did, they would be cut; only &s;ome are &s;uffered to carry on board Provi&s;ions, but they cannot take Money for them; they only keep an account, and they are payed when the permi&s;&s;ion for Traffick is come from Court.</P>
<P>That permi&s;&s;ion is not granted till three months and a half after the arri|val of the Fleet, but then the Merchants may buy;<NOTE PLACE="marg">The time of Traffick in <HI>Japan.</HI></NOTE> and they carry Barks on board the <HI>Dutch</HI> Ships to take in the Goods, and carry them to the <HI>Di&s;ima.</HI> The <HI>Japane&s;e</HI> allow, or rather order &s;ix Men of every Ve&s;&s;el, to come a-Shoar, and buy and &s;ell upon their own account, and to &s;tay four days in the Penin&s;ule or in the Town at their Option; when the four days are o|ver, they are had back again to their Ships; then pre&s;ently they &s;end &s;ix o|thers, and the &s;ame thing is done every four days, during the &s;ix weeks liberty of Trading; but the&s;e &s;ix Men mu&s;t be of the Ships Company, for Merchants would not be &s;uffered; and that permi&s;&s;ion is in &s;ome mea&s;ure granted con|trary to the will of the <HI>Dutch</HI> Company. The <HI>Japane&s;e</HI> make it a point of honour to breed Merchants; they &s;ay in their Language that after one hath been little he mu&s;t become great, and its &s;aid, they have made it an Article in their Treaty. The&s;e new Merchants hire a little Shop, for which they pay about a <HI>Pia&s;tre</HI> for the four days, and he that lets them the Shop, &s;erves them for a Servant and Broaker to bring as many Cu&s;tomers as he can.</P>
<P>As concerning the Goods of the Company, the <HI>Dutch</HI> &s;et the price, and write a Li&s;t or Envoice of them, with the price on the Margin; when that Li&s;t is Tran&s;lated into <HI>Japane&s;e,</HI> the two Li&s;ts are affixt to the Gate of the Town which leads to the <HI>Penin&s;ule,</HI> that all may read them; and when they have fitted them&s;elves they pay in Silver, but having no Coined Sil|ver, they give Bullion by weight; they have pieces of Silver often Crowns, five Crowns, one Crown, and of &s;maller value too; their &s;mall Money is of Copper, of the bigne&s;s of <HI>French</HI> Doubles.</P>
<P>The Commodities the <HI>Dutch</HI> carry to <HI>Japan</HI> are Cloves,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Dutch</HI> Commodities at <HI>Japan.</HI></NOTE> but in a &s;mall quantity, and they do &s;o that the <HI>Japane&s;e</HI> may not be glutted with them, and that they may have the price which they have &s;et upon them at fir&s;t, which is ten Crowns the pound; they carry thither al&s;o Cinnamon, Sugar and Cloaths. The Goods they buy are Silver, Purcelin and Gold; but the Gold they buy only privately, becau&s;e it is prohibited to be exported: They carry off Copper in little Che&s;ts, which are commonly an hundred and thirty pound weight, and they pay for them twelve Crowns apiece. When the &s;ix weeks (wherein it is allowed to Trade) are over, there is no more Traffick, and the <HI>Japane&s;e</HI> are no longer &s;uffered to go to the Penin&s;ule, nor the <HI>Dutch</HI> to come out of their Ships, &s;o that there being nothing more for them to do in that Countrey, the Fleet returns, and the <HI>Dutch</HI> of the <HI>Di&s;ima</HI> remain alone until the <HI>Mon&s;on</HI> next year.</P>
<P>The only diver&s;ion they have, is with the <HI>Japane&s;e</HI> Curti&s;ans, becau&s;e they are ea&s;ie to be had: This being no di&s;graceful Trade in <HI>Japan,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Curti&s;ans <HI>in</HI> Japan.</NOTE> There are tho&s;e who Traffick that way, and keep &s;everal Girls in their Hou&s;es to be

<P>The Town of <HI>Cachan</HI> is begirt with a Ditch and two Walls,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cachan.</NOTE> which began to be ruinous; it is two hours march in circuit; the <HI>Bazars</HI> of the Town are Arched, and have the light by round Windows, which are in the Arches at a Fathoms di&s;tance one from another, and the&s;e <HI>Bazars</HI> being very large, I went too and again in them a long while on Hor&s;e-back: This is a Town of much Trade, and the Shops areas well furni&s;hed as at <HI>I&s;pahan.</HI></P>
<P>They work here in Gold and Silk, and the lovely Flowered Girdles that are carried to <HI>I&s;pahan,</HI> are made in this Town, as al&s;o mo&s;t excellent Earthen Ware, which is &s;old through the re&s;t of <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> and in the <HI>Indies.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Kervan&s;eras</HI> are pretty well built, but the private Hou&s;es are &s;o ugly, (that except the Kings Hou&s;e,) there is not any worth the minding: There is a <HI>Meidan</HI> there as in other Towns, and I was told there were Scorpions there as long as ones finger, who&s;e Sting was mortal; but the people of the Coun|trey affirm, that they do no hurt to &s;trangers, which I take to be a Fable, and I &s;aw none of them; we &s;tayed three days there, and leaving it on the third, we came to the Town of <HI>Com.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Com.</NOTE></P>
<P>This Town hath a Ditch and Earthen Walls like to tho&s;e of a Village, and are ruined in &s;everal places; it will require two hours to make the cir|cuit of it. The Streets are wide and &s;treight, and the <HI>Bazars</HI> narrow; the <HI>Meidan</HI> is a pretty hand&s;om &s;quare; the Palace of the King, and Hou&s;es of the great Men are in the Suburbs. King <HI>Cha-Abas</HI> the Second died there, and there lyes buried.</P>

<P>The Body of the Mo&s;que goes quite round the Chappel of <HI>Ma&s;oume,</HI> the Pavement of it is covered with Carpet; at the end of the Temple (on the richt &s;ide,) is the Chappel of <HI>Cha-Sefi,</HI> which is Arched,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Chappel of <HI>Cha-Sefi.</HI></NOTE> and the entry into it is by two Silver-Gates, the Thre&s;holds being of the &s;ame Metal; his Tomb is covered with Cloath of Gold, and I found there a <HI>Moula</HI> repeating the <HI>Al|coran;</HI> behind the Tomb there is a Silver-Grate a Fathom nigh and three Fathom broad, going out of that Chappel one &s;ees the Chappel of <HI>Cha-Abas</HI> the Second, which is directly oppo&s;ite to it; it hath likewi&s;e the Doors and
