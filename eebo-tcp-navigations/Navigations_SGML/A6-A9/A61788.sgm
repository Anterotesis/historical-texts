<HEAD>Strange News from <HI>Virginia,</HI> being a full and true account of the Life and Death of <HI>Nathanael Bacon</HI> E&s;qiure, who was the only Cau&s;e and Original of all the late Trou|bles in that Country.</HEAD>
<P>THERE is no Nation this day under the copes of Hea|ven can &s;o experimentally &s;peak the &s;ad Effects of men of great Parts being reduc't to nece&s;&s;ity, as <HI>England;</HI> but not to rake up the notorious mi&s;de|meanours of the dead, I &s;hall endeavour to prevent the &s;ad ef|fects of &s;o deplorable a Cau&s;e, by giving you an account of the remarkable Life and Death of this Gentleman of whom I am about to di&s;cour&s;e. And becau&s;e when a man has once ingag'd him&s;elf in an ill action, all men are ready to heap an innumera|ble a&s;per&s;ions upon him, of which he is no ways guilty, I &s;hall be &s;o ju&s;t in the Hi&s;tory of his Life as not to rob him of tho&s;e Commendations which his Birth and Acqui&s;itions claim as due, and &s;o kind both to Loyalty and the whol&s;om con&s;tituted Laws of our Kingdom, as not to &s;mother any thing which would render him to blame.</P>
<P>This Gentleman who has of late becconed the attention of all men of under&s;tanding who are any ways de&s;irous of Novelty, or care what becomes of any part of the World be&s;ides that them&s;elves live in, had the honour to be de&s;cended of an An|cient and Honourable Family, his Name <HI>Nathanael Bacon,</HI> to which to the long known Title of Gentleman, by his long &s;tudy in the Inns of Court he has &s;ince added that of E&s;quire. He was the Son of Mr. <HI>Thomas Bacon</HI> of an ancient Seat known by the denomination of <HI>Free&s;tone-Hall</HI> in the County of <HI>Suffolk,</HI> a Gentleman of known loyalty and ability. His Father as he was
<PB N="3" REF="2">able &s;o he was willing to allow this his Son a very Gentile Com|petency to &s;ub&s;i&s;t upon, but he as it proved having a Soul too large for that allowance, could not contain him&s;elf within bounds; which his careful Father perceiving, and al&s;o that he had a mind to Travel (having &s;een divers parts of the World before) con&s;ented to his inclination of going to <HI>Virginia,</HI> and accommodated him with a Stock for that purpo&s;e, to the value of 1800 <HI>l. Starling,</HI> as I am credibly informed by a Merchant of very good worth, who is now in this City, and had the for|tune to carry him thither.</P>
<P>He began his Voyage thitherwards about Three years &s;ince, and lived for about a years &s;pace in that Continent in very good repute, his extraordinary parts like a Letter of recommendation rendring him acceptable in all mens company, whil&s;t his con&s;i|derable Concerns in that place were able to bear him out in the be&s;t of Society. The&s;e Accompli&s;hments of mind and fortune rendred him &s;o remarkable, that the worthy Governour of that Continent thought it requi&s;ite to take him into his Privy Council.</P>
<P>That Plantation which he cho&s;e to &s;ettle in is generally known by the name of <HI>Curles,</HI> &s;ituate in the upper part of <HI>James</HI> River, and the time of his Revolt was not till the beginning of <HI>March</HI> 1675/6. At which time the <HI>Su&s;quo-hannan Indians</HI> (a known Ene|my to that Country) having made an In&s;urrection, and kild di|vers of the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> among&s;t whom it was his fortune to have a Servant &s;lain; in revenge of who&s;e death, and other dammages he received from tho&s;e turbulent <HI>Su&s;quohanians,</HI> without the Governour's con&s;ent he furiou&s;ly took up Arms again&s;t them, and was &s;o fortunate as to put them to flight, but not content therewith; the afore&s;aid <HI>Governour</HI> hearing of his eager pur&s;uit after the vanqui&s;ht <HI>Indians,</HI> &s;ent out a &s;elect Company of Soul|diers to command him to de&s;i&s;t; but he in&s;tead of li&s;tning there|unto, per&s;i&s;ted in his Revenge, and &s;ent to the <HI>Governour</HI> to intreat his Commi&s;&s;ion, that he might more chearfully pro&s;e|cute his de&s;ign; which being denyed him by the Me&s;&s;enger he
<PB N="4" REF="3">&s;ent for that purpo&s;e, he notwith&s;tanding continued to make head with his own Servants, and other <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> then re&s;ident in <HI>Curles</HI> again&s;t them. In this interim the People of <HI>Henrica</HI> had returned him Burge&s;s of their County; and he in order thereunto took his own Sloop and came down towards <HI>James Town,</HI> conducted by thirty odd Souldiers, with part of which he came a&s;hore to Mr. <HI>Laurences</HI> Hou&s;e, to under&s;tand whether he might come in with &s;afety or not, but being di&s;covered by one Par&s;on <HI>Clough,</HI> and al&s;o it being perceived that he had lined the Bu&s;hes of the &s;aid Town with Souldiers, the Governour thereupon ordered an allarm to be beaten through the whole Town, which took &s;o hot, that <HI>Bacon</HI> thinking him&s;elf not &s;e|cure whil&s;t he remained there within reach of their Fort, im|mediately commanded his men aboard, and tow'd his Sloop up the River; which the Governour perceiving, ordered the Ships which lay at <HI>Sandy-point</HI> to pur&s;ue and take him; and they by the indu&s;try of their Commanders &s;ucceeded &s;o well in the at|tempt, that they pre&s;ently &s;topt his pa&s;&s;age; &s;o that Mr. <HI>Bacon</HI> finding him&s;elf pur&s;ued both before and behind, after &s;ome ca|pitulations, quietly &s;urrendred him&s;elf Pri&s;oner to the Gover|nours Commi&s;&s;ioners, to the great &s;atisfaction of all his Friends; which action of his was &s;o obliging to the Governour, that he granted him his liberty immediately upon Paroll, without con|fining him either to Pri&s;on or Chamber, and the next day, af|ter &s;ome private di&s;cour&s;e pa&s;&s;ed betwixt the Governour, the Privy Council, and him&s;elf, he was amply re&s;tored to all his former Honours and Dignities, and a Commi&s;&s;ion partly pro|mi&s;ed him to be General again&s;t the <HI>Indian</HI> Army; but upon farther enquiry into his Affairs it was not thought fit to be grant|ed him; whereat his ambitious mind &s;eem'd mightily to be di&s;pleas'd; in&s;omuch that he gave out, that it was his intenti|on to &s;ell his whole concerns in <HI>Virginia,</HI> and to go with his whole Family to live either in <HI>Merry-land</HI> or the <HI>South,</HI> becau&s;e he would avoid (as he &s;aid) the &s;candal of being accounted a factious per&s;on there. But this re&s;olution it &s;eems was but a
<PB N="5" REF="3">pretence, for afterwards he headed the &s;ame-Runnagado <HI>En|gli&s;h</HI> that he formerly found ready to undertake and go &s;harers with him in any of his Rebellions, and adding to them the a&s;|&s;i&s;tance of his own Slaves and Servants, headed them &s;o far till they toucht at the <HI>Occonegies</HI> Town, where he was treated very civilly, and by the Inhabitants informed where &s;ome of the <HI>Su&s;quohanno's</HI> were inforted, whom pre&s;ently he a&s;&s;ails, and after he had vanqui&s;hed them, &s;lew about &s;eventy of them in their Fort: But as he returned back to the <HI>Occoneges,</HI> he found they had fortified them&s;elves with divers more <HI>Indians</HI> than they had at his fir&s;t arrival; wherefore he de&s;ired Ho&s;tages of them for their good behaviour, whil&s;t he and his followers lay with|in command of their Fort. But tho&s;e treacherous <HI>Indians</HI> grown confident by rea&s;on of their late recruit, returned him this An|&s;wer, <HI>That their Guns were the only Ho&s;tages he was like to have of them, and if he would have them he mu&s;t fetch them.</HI> Which was no &s;ooner &s;poke, but the <HI>Indians</HI> &s;allied out of the Fort and &s;hot one of his Sentinels, whereupon he charged them &s;o fierce|ly, that the Fight continued not only all that day, but the next al&s;o, till the approach of the Evening, at which time finding his men grow faint for want of Provi&s;ion, he laid hold of the opportunity, being befriended by a gloomy night, and &s;o made an honourable retreat homewards.</P>
<P><HI>Howbeit</HI> we may judge what re&s;pect he had gain'd in <HI>James-Town</HI> by this &s;ub&s;equent tran&s;action. When he was fir&s;t brought hither it was frequently reported among the Com|monalty that he was kept clo&s;e Pri&s;oner, which report cau|&s;ed the people of that Town, tho&s;e of <HI>Charles-City, Henrico,</HI> and <HI>New-Kent</HI> Countries, being in all about the Number of eight hundred, or a thou&s;and, to ri&s;e and march thitherwards in or|der to his re&s;cue; whereupon the Governor was forced to de|&s;ire Mr. <HI>Bacon</HI> to go him&s;elf in Per&s;on, and by his open appea|rance quiet the people.</P>
<P>This being pa&s;t, Mr. <HI>Bacon,</HI> about the 25th. of <HI>June</HI> la&s;t, di&s;|&s;atisfied that he could not have a Commi&s;&s;ion granted him to
<PB N="6" REF="4">go again&s;t the <HI>Indians,</HI> in the night time departed the Town unknown to any body, and about a week after got together between four and five hundred men of <HI>New-Kent</HI> County, with whom he marched to <HI>James-Town,</HI> and drew up in order before the Hou&s;e of State; and there peremptorily demanded of the Governor, <HI>Council</HI> and <HI>Burge&s;&s;es</HI> (there then collected) a Com|mi&s;&s;ion to go again&s;t the <HI>Indians,</HI> which if they &s;hould refu&s;e to grant him, he told them that neither he nor ne're a man in his Company would depart from their Doors till he had ob|tained his reque&s;t; whereupon to prevent farther danger in &s;o great an exigence, the Council and Burge&s;&s;es by much intrea|ty obtain'd him a Commi&s;&s;ion Signed by the <HI>Governor,</HI> an Act for one thou&s;and men to be Li&s;ted under his command to go again&s;t the <HI>Indians,</HI> to whom the &s;ame pay was to be grant|ed as was allowed to them who went again&s;t the <HI>Fort.</HI> But <HI>Bacon</HI> was not &s;atisfied with this, but afterwards earne&s;tly im|portuned, and at length obtained of the <HI>Hou&s;e,</HI> to pa&s;s an Act of Indemnity to all Per&s;ons who had &s;ided with him, and al&s;o Letters of recommendations from the Governor to his Maje&s;ty in his behalf; and moreover cau&s;ed Collonel <HI>Claybourn</HI> and his Son Captain <HI>Claybourn,</HI> Lieutenant Collonel <HI>We&s;t,</HI> and Lieu|tenant Collonel <HI>Hill,</HI> and many others, to be degraded for ever bearing any Office, whether it were Military or Civil.</P>
<P>Having obtained the&s;e large Civilities of the <HI>Governor, &amp;c.</HI> one would have thought that if the Principles of hone&s;ty would not have obliged him to peace and loyalty, tho&s;e of gratitude &s;hould. But, alas, when men have been once flu&s;ht or entred with Vice, how hard is it for them to leave it, e&s;pecially if it tends towards ambition or greatne&s;s, which is the general lu&s;t of a large Soul, and the common error of va&s;t parts, which fix their Eyes &s;o upon the lure of greatne&s;s, that they have no time left them to con&s;ider by what indirect and unlawful means they mu&s;t (if ever) attain it.</P>
<P>This certainly was Mr. <HI>Bacon</HI>'s Crime, who after he had once lanched into Rebellion, nay, and upon &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion had been par|doned
<PB N="7" REF="4">for it, and al&s;o re&s;tored, as if he had committed no &s;uch hainous offence, to his former honour and dignities (which were con&s;iderable enough to content any rea&s;onable mind) yet for all this he could not forbear wading into his former mi&s;|demeanors, and continued his oppo&s;ition again&s;t that prudent and e&s;tabli&s;hed Government, ordered by his Maje&s;ty of <HI>Great Brittain</HI> to be duly ob&s;erved in that Continent.</P>
<P>In fine, he continued (I cannot &s;ay properly in the Fields, but) in the Woods with a con&s;iderable Army all la&s;t Summer, and maintain'd &s;everal Bru&s;hes with the Governors Party: &s;ome|time routing them, and burning all before him, to the great damage of many of his Maje&s;ties loyal Subjects there re&s;ident; &s;ometimes he and his Rebels were beaten by the Governor, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and forc't to run for &s;helter among&s;t the Woods and Swomps. In which lamentable condition that unhappy Continent has re|main'd for the &s;pace of almo&s;t a Twelve-month, every one there|in that were able being forc't to take up Arms for &s;ecurity of their own lives, and no one reckoning their Goods, Wives, or Children to be their own, &s;ince they were &s;o dangerou&s;ly expos'd to the doubtful Accidents of an uncertain War.</P>
<P>But the indulgent Heavens, who are alone able to compute what mea&s;ure of puni&s;hments are adequate or fit for the &s;ins or tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions of a Nation, has in its great mercy thought fit to put a &s;top, at lea&s;t, if not a total period and conclu&s;ion to the&s;e <HI>Virginian</HI> troubles, by the death of this <HI>Nat. Bacon,</HI> the great Mole&s;tor of the quiet of that mi&s;erable Nation; &s;o that now we who are here in <HI>England,</HI> and have any Relations or Corre&s;pon|dence with any of the Inhabitants of that Continent, may by the arrival of the next Ships from that Coa&s;t expect to hear that they are freed from all their dangers, quitted of all their fears, and in great hopes and expectation to live quietly under their own Vines, and enjoy the benefit of their commendable labours.</P>
<P>I know it is by &s;ome reported that this Mr. <HI>Bacon</HI> was a very hard drinker, and that he dyed by inbibing, or taking in two much Brandy. But I am informed by tho&s;e who are Per&s;ons of
<PB N="8" REF="5">undoubted Reputation, and had the happine&s;s to &s;ee the &s;ame Letter which gave his Maje&s;ty an account of his death, that there was no &s;uch thing therein mentioned: he was certainly a Per&s;on indued with great natural parts, which notwit&s;t&s;tand|ing his juvenile extravagances he had adorned with many ela|borate acqui&s;itions, and by the help of learning and &s;tudy knew how to manage them to a Miracle, it being the general vogue of all that knew him, that he u&s;ually &s;poke as much &s;en&s;e in as few words, and delivered that &s;en&s;e as opportunely as any they ever kept company withal: Wherefore as I am my &s;elf a Lover of Ingenuity, though an abhorrer of di&s;turbance or Rebellion, I think fit &s;ince Providence was plea&s;ed to let him dye a Natural death in his Bed, not to a&s;per&s;e him with &s;aying he kill'd him|&s;elf with drinking.</P>
