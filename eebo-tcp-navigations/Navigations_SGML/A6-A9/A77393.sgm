<HEAD>A Continuation of the <HI>TURKS</HI> Proceedings, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>_IN all This Action the <HI>Grand Vi|zier</HI> has playd both the <HI>Fox,</HI> and the <HI>Lion,</HI> mingling <HI>Fair words,</HI> and <HI>Threatnings;</HI> and Publi&s;hing &s;till before the Blow, &s;uch pro|mi&s;es of <HI>Liberty,</HI> and <HI>Immunity</HI> to &s;uch as would range them&s;elves under his pro|tection, as he well knew mo&s;t likely to work upon the People, he had to deal with. It is true, that the&s;e Overtures of Clemency, from &s;o barbarous an Enemy, were look'd upon
<PB N="24" REF="3">by the wi&s;er &s;ort, rather as a trick of <HI>State,</HI> then <HI>Good-faith;</HI> yet with the Generality, This way of proceeding took effect.</P>
<P>The Place mo&s;t in the <HI>Turks</HI> eye was <HI>Pre&s;|burg;</HI> being the chief City of the <HI>Nether-Hun|gary:</HI> (wherein is laid up the <HI>Hungarian</HI> Crown) A Place, con&s;iderable both for the <HI>Goodline&s;s</HI> of the Town, and for the <HI>Situation</HI> of it; to which advantage the <HI>Turk</HI> was no Stranger; as ap|pears by the frequent <HI>Alarms,</HI> he gave to that City, the gaining whereof, would have open|ed him a way to <HI>Vienna,</HI> on the One &s;ide, and to <HI>Raab, Comorra,</HI> and <HI>Newhau&s;el,</HI> on the Other: The <HI>Danube</HI> pa&s;sing by in Two Branches, to the I&s;land <HI>Schut,</HI> at the end whereof &s;tands the Fort <HI>Comorra;</HI> and <HI>Raab</HI> not far off. Nor was it unknown to <HI>Count Strozzi,</HI> (the Governour of <HI>Presburg</HI>) how much the &s;afety of the <HI>Whole,</HI> Depended upon the Security of This <HI>Part,</HI> which mov'd him to make timely provi&s;ion, for the Defence thereof. But the neighbouring Places, that lay open, as <HI>St. George, Po&s;ing, Mo|dern,</HI> &amp;c. cho&s;e rather to &s;ubmit, then expo&s;e them&s;elves to the extremityes of Fire and Sword, by an unprofitable Oppo&s;ition. <HI>Neutra</HI> indeed (a Place not far from <HI>Newhau&s;el,</HI> nor le&s;s defen&s;ible) might have re&s;i&s;ted, but did not, and upon the Rendition the Garri&s;on,
<PB N="25" REF="3">according to agreement, was conducted to <HI>Presburg. Tyrnaw,</HI> and other Towns yielded al&s;o.</P>
<P>The Enemies next Attempt was upon <HI>Schin|ta,</HI> wherein was lodg'd a fayr Artillery, but the Governour deported him&s;elf valiantly, and beat them off. By this time, <HI>October</HI> was half over, and the &s;ea&s;on, call'd the <HI>Turk</HI> to his <HI>Winter-Quarters:</HI> who finding his time lo&s;t up|on <HI>Schinta,</HI> drew off to <HI>Newhau&s;el;</HI> which place is now repaired, and &s;trongly Garri&s;on'd, the River <HI>Neutra</HI> being brought round about it. From Thence, the <HI>Turk</HI> took his march, with a con&s;iderable Body, to the <HI>Ship-Bridge</HI> at <HI>Gran,</HI> and cau&s;ed &s;ome of his great Guns to be pa&s;&s;'d over there, as if his purpo&s;e had been to Win|ter in his own Territories. Tho&s;e of <HI>New|bau&s;el</HI> laboured hard to get into the <HI>Schut,</HI> and &s;ettle them&s;elves, betwixt the Two Forts of <HI>Raab,</HI> and <HI>Comorra:</HI> whereupon <HI>Montecuculi</HI> and <HI>Serini</HI> joyn'd their Forces to oppo&s;e them.</P>
<P>And now the fortune of the Warre &s;eem'd a little to flatter the <HI>Chri&s;tians; Nicholas Serini</HI> on the 17. of <HI>Oct.</HI> defeating a Party of 300 <HI>Turks,</HI> and his Brother <HI>Peter,</HI> about the &s;ame time fal|ling upon a Body of about 7000 of them near <HI>Carl&s;tadt,</HI> on the Frontiers of <HI>Stiria:</HI> where they de&s;igned an Inrode upon the <HI>Christians;</HI>
<PB N="26" REF="4">but <HI>Count Serini,</HI> and <HI>Count Aursburg,</HI> from an <HI>Ambu&s;cade,</HI> brake in among them, &s;lew 1000, and took 100 Pri&s;oners; among which were diver&s;e Per&s;ons of Note, and the Son of a great <HI>Ba&s;&s;a:</HI> the re&s;t di&s;per&s;t them&s;elves; and the Victorious in this Adventure got great Booty.</P>
<P>The <HI>Serinies</HI> have &s;hew'd them&s;elves, in This their deportment, the true Heirs of the Honour, and Valour of that Noble Family; and they put us in mind, of a memorable Action, which was performed by their Grandfather, <HI>Nicholas Serini</HI> in the year 1566, <HI>To his Eternall Glory.</HI></P>
<P REND="italic">On the <HI>6th</HI> of <HI>Augu&s;t 1566, Solyman</HI> the <HI>Mag|nificent</HI> layd Siege to the Fort <HI>Sigeth,</HI> wherein this great Captain, <HI>Nicholas Serini</HI> was Governour; who made many bold Sallyes upon the Eenemy, took many Pri&s;oners, and at one time cau&s;ed <HI>300 Turks</HI> to be beheaded; which &s;o far enraged <HI>Solyman,</HI> that he plyed his Batteries, and Attempts, with greater fu|ry then before. <HI>Serini</HI> perceiving the <HI>New-Town</HI> to be upon the poynt of being entred, cau&s;ed it to be &s;et on fire, and retreated into the <HI>Old.</HI></P>
<P REND="italic">A while after, the <HI>Turks</HI> a&s;&s;aulted the <HI>Old Town,</HI> but were &s;o bravely received, that in One Storm they lo&s;t <HI>2000</HI> men. However they attempted it again, and carried it; whereupon, <HI>Serini</HI> was forced to retire into the <HI>Ca&s;tle,</HI> against which the Enemy planted a
<PB N="27" REF="4">Battery, and gave One &s;urious Attaque; but were beaten off with great lo&s;s.</P>
<P REND="italic">While This pa&s;&s;'d, <HI>Solyman</HI> died of a Bloody-Flux, <HI>(Sept. 4.)</HI> but <HI>Mahomet Ba&s;&s;a</HI> labouring as much as po&s;sible to keep his death conceal'd from the <HI>Turks,</HI> cau&s;ed the Corps (Embalmed, and Gloriou&s;ly Clothed) to be expo&s;'d in a dark place to the People, as &s;itting on his Throne, and the <HI>Ba&s;&s;a</HI> him&s;elf, with all his u&s;uall Ceremonyes, and Reverence, feigning &s;ome &s;ingular matter of privacy, and bu&s;ine&s;s with him. At length, the <HI>Ba&s;&s;a</HI> went out of the Tent, wiping his eyes as if he had been crying; which gave the Officers occa&s;ion to enquire, why he wept? To whom he re|plyed, that <HI>It grieved his heart to think how ma|ny brave Souldiers would be &s;uddenly put to the Sword:</HI> for (&s;ayes he) <HI>Solyman</HI> has made a <HI>deep</HI> and <HI>de&s;perate Oath,</HI> that if this Place be not taken in two dayes, every Colonel that bears any Charge in the Attempt, &s;hall certainly be put to death. Hereupon, the <HI>Janizaryes</HI> fell into a direct Rage, and gave a furious A&s;&s;ault, but were repul&s;ed with ex|ceeding lo&s;&s;e: they had howover &s;et fire to the <HI>Ca&s;tle,</HI> and now the Noble Defender of it, &s;eeing his fate be|fore his eyes, call'd the &s;mall remainder of his men a|bout him, and exhorted them to &s;tand by him, and re|&s;olve to dye with him. Whereupon, he Clothed him&s;elf in a <HI>Violet-coloured Velvet Suit,</HI> took the <HI>Key</HI> of the <HI>Ca&s;tle,</HI> and &s;ome Gold in his <HI>Pocket;</HI> cau&s;'d
<PB N="28" REF="5">the Gates to be open'd, and the great Guns to be drawn thither, and di&s;charged among the Enemy: and in a Cloud of Smoak, he i&s;&s;ued forth with his Men, among the <HI>Turks,</HI> and fought till he was &s;hot in the head. This was the end of the Valiant <HI>Serini.</HI> It was rec|koned that <HI>20000 Turks</HI> were &s;lain before this Fort. No &s;ooner was <HI>Serini</HI> fain, but the <HI>Infidels</HI> throng|ing about the Corps, cut off his head, and &s;et it on a Pole for one day, after which, they &s;ent it with a Scoffe to <HI>Maximilian</HI> the Emperour. <HI>Now to re&s;ume the Story.</HI></P>
<P>In <HI>October,</HI> the <HI>Count</HI> of <HI>Hollach,</HI> being cho&s;en General of the <HI>Imperiall Auxiliaryes,</HI> came to <HI>Vien|na,</HI> his Forces (amounting to 6 or 7000 men) being Enquarter'd betwixt <HI>That,</HI> and <HI>Crembs;</HI> The Emperours Army, lying at that time near <HI>Presburg,</HI> to recruit, being much weakned by many Inconveniencies. The whole Army, (with the <HI>Hungartans, Croatians,</HI> and <HI>Auxiliaryes,</HI> was computed to be 40000 &s;trong; but the &s;e|verall heads, of &s;o many Nations, who at this time were almo&s;t all in <HI>Vienna,</HI> could not (it &s;eems) agree &s;o well together, as not to need his <HI>Imperiall</HI> Maje&s;tie's &s;ingular Care, and Cir|cum&s;pect on to keep them from flying into <HI>Partyes,</HI> and <HI>Pa&s;sions.</HI> There was an Intent to joyn 7 or 8000 men that were ray&s;ed in <HI>Sile&s;ia</HI>
<PB N="29" REF="5">to This Body; but the <HI>Sile&s;ian</HI> Forces would neither march out of their native Country, nor obey any Forreign Command; &s;o that They &s;tayd at home to defend their <HI>Borders,</HI> and e&s;pe|cially, the Pa&s;&s;age by <HI>Jablunka.</HI></P>
<P>While the <HI>Chri&s;tians</HI> were laying their heads, and their Forces together, to put them&s;elves in|to a Po&s;ture, the Enemy brake up with his main Body before <HI>Newhau&s;el,</HI> and about the end of <HI>October,</HI> took his March toward <HI>Gran,</HI> and <HI>Offen.</HI> The <HI>Tartars</HI> al&s;o with their Prey marched toward <HI>Tartary,</HI> carrying along with them their chiefe&s;t Captives in Coaches, and Wagons, driving their ordinary Pri&s;oners a|long with Whips, naked; and their hair flying about their eyes, ju&s;t like &s;o many Bea&s;ts. In <HI>&V;pper-Hungary,</HI> they met with &s;ome oppo&s;ition, at which time many of the Captives were for|ced out of their hands, and about 2000 of the&s;e <HI>Tartars</HI> put to the Sword. Count <HI>Nicholas Se|rini</HI>'s De&s;igne, was to fall upon them, at their pa&s;&s;ing over the <HI>Ship-Bridge,</HI> and followed them clo&s;e, &s;ometime in the <HI>Rear,</HI> other|wile on the <HI>Flanck,</HI> &s;till ob&s;erving their mo|tion till he found his opportunity to attaque them.</P>
<PB N="30" REF="6">
<P>Upon the la&s;t day of <HI>October,</HI> he &s;et upon the <HI>Rear,</HI> and took from them 5 Wagons full of Captives, that they had gotten in <HI>Moravia;</HI> 200 Oxen, and 40 Wagons with Provi&s;ion. In this Action, he did not only relea&s;e the Cap|tives, but defeated al&s;o their Drivers, which were about 600 <HI>Janizaries.</HI> They fought &s;tout|ly for 2 hours from behind their Wagons, &s;o that Count <HI>Serini</HI> his <HI>Hu&s;&s;ars,</HI> were forced to quit their Hor&s;es, and fight them on foot: which they did with excellent conduct, and &s;ucce&s;&s;e, giving Quarter only to Two Per|&s;ons of Note, who&s;e lives were at their mer|cy.</P>
<P>Herewith, this <HI>Campagnia</HI> &s;eem'd to be at an end, and Count <HI>Serini,</HI> having in appearance little to do further with the Enemy, let his men march homeward: (wanting Fodder for their Hor&s;es) the Enemy in the mean while &s;teering their Cour&s;e toward <HI>Gran, Offen,</HI> and <HI>Wei&s;&s;enburg,</HI> as to their <HI>Winter-Quarters.</HI> The <HI>Turks</HI> left a Garri&s;on of 4000 in <HI>Newhau&s;el,</HI> under the Com|mand of Two <HI>Ba&s;&s;aes;</HI> and 10000 about the Fort, partly to defend the <HI>Place,</HI> and partly to repair the <HI>Fortifications.</HI> In <HI>Neutra,</HI> the Enemy left 1500 men, which Place was plundred be|fore
<PB N="31" REF="6">the Army march'd away. The Earls <HI>Co|chary,</HI> and <HI>Tekelly,</HI> with a Body of near 15000 men ray&s;ed in the <HI>&V;pper</HI> and <HI>Nether-Hungary,</HI> came In to Count <HI>Serini;</HI> which Conjunction the <HI>Turks</HI> mightily endeavoured to hinder, but could not effect it. The&s;e Forces are like|wi&s;e drawn out of the Field, &s;ince that time.</P>
<P>The <HI>Auxiliaryes,</HI> That is to &s;ay; the <HI>He&s;&s;en, Brun&s;wick, Lunenburg, Mun&s;ter</HI> Forces; and O|thers from the <HI>Rhyne</HI> (&s;ome of which, name|ly Tho&s;e from <HI>He&s;&s;en Darm&s;tadt</HI> peri&s;h'd upon the <HI>Danube</HI>) are put into <HI>Winter-Quarters</HI> on the &s;ide of that River; but the <HI>Saxon,</HI> and <HI>Brandenburg Auxiliaryes,</HI> are to lye in <HI>Bohemia,</HI> and <HI>Moravia;</HI> and the <HI>Sile&s;ian</HI> Forces to tarry in their own Country: for the Councel of Warre at <HI>Vienna,</HI> did not hold it Advi&s;able, to Quarter all the <HI>Auxiliaryes</HI> near together, for fear of Surfeits upon the Fruits, be&s;ide that they would have wanted Fodder for their Hor&s;e, and in the foul deep wayes they would have found great trouble to have fetch'd it. Another Con&s;ideration was, the Ea&s;ing of the <HI>Hungarians,</HI> who were already &s;ufficiently weary of Billeting Souldiers. In Fine; there
<PB REF="7">is no great Noy&s;e of Armes, and Action, at pre&s;ent, but how the Enemy may be oppo&s;'d next Spring, is the Con&s;ulation, and the Que|&s;tion; who threatens <HI>Vienna,</HI> and the <HI>Empire,</HI> with no le&s;&s;e then 3 or 400000 Men at the Next <HI>Campagnia.</HI></P>
<P>It was now Re&s;olv'd by his <HI>Imperiall</HI> Maje&s;ty, to go to <HI>Regen&s;purg</HI> about the end of <HI>November</HI> following; there to Advi&s;e about the Relie&s;e of the <HI>Empire,</HI> and indeed of <HI>Christendome:</HI> and his <HI>Imperiall</HI> Maje&s;ty did likewi&s;e Re&s;olve to &s;end Emba&s;&s;adours to the <HI>Pope, Spain, France,</HI> &amp;c. to Sollicit Succour. From the <HI>Pope, Mo|nyes</HI> are expected, <HI>France</HI> proffers <HI>Men</HI> (but who dares receive them?) <HI>Swede</HI> is willing to A&s;si&s;t in re&s;pect of their Intere&s;t in <HI>Germany,</HI> and they have &s;ent already 700 well mounted that came from <HI>Bremen:</HI> &s;o that the In&s;tant Bu&s;ine&s;s of the <HI>Empire</HI> &s;eems to be rather <HI>Pre|paration,</HI> then <HI>Pre&s;ent Defence;</HI> and to look for|ward toward the Spring: the <HI>Grand Signior</HI> ha|ving already di&s;per&s;'d his Letters of Menace, and Defyance to all <HI>Christendome</HI> throughout the <HI>Emperours</HI> Hereditary Countries.</P>
<P>Upon the <HI>Turks</HI> withdrawing the Gro&s;&s;e of
<PB N="33" REF="7">his Army, from about <HI>Newhau&s;el,</HI> over the <HI>Da|nube,</HI> with a Countenance of Di&s;po&s;ing him|&s;elf to his <HI>Winter-Quarter;</HI> Mens minds began to be a little Compo&s;'d and Quiet; till <HI>Abaf|ti,</HI> the <HI>Grand Signiors</HI> Creature in <HI>Tran&s;ylvania</HI> undertook the <HI>Turks</HI> Aftergame, with tho&s;e Forces that &s;tay'd behind; labouring his Ut|mo&s;t to po&s;&s;e&s;&s;e him&s;elf of the <HI>Berg,</HI> or <HI>Mine-Towns,</HI> (whence comes the <HI>Hungarian</HI> Gold) and other Frontier Places, and Hou&s;es belong|ing of Right to his <HI>Imperiall</HI> Maje&s;ty: which Perfidious De&s;igne the <HI>Chri&s;tians</HI> Army could not conveniently either prevent, or oppo&s;e, being already di&s;per&s;'d for want of Nece&s;&s;a|ryes both for Man, and Bea&s;t.</P>
<P>This &s;ame <HI>Abafti;</HI> pa&s;&s;'d in Common E|&s;teem, for a Per&s;on well-affected to the <HI>Chri|&s;tians,</HI> and as One that wayted only a fayre Opportunity to draw his Sword again&s;t the <HI>Turk;</HI> but his Actions have now di&s;cover'd him: for perceiving what Reputation, Pre&s;ents, and other Popular Advantages, have accrued to the <HI>Grand Vizier,</HI> and the Chiefe Officers of the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Army, upon the Gayning of <HI>New|hau&s;el;</HI> he likewi&s;e turn'd his Study, and En|deavours the &s;ame way, not doubting by his

<P>About This Time; Newes was brought that a young Son was born to <HI>Mahomet,</HI> upon which Tydings, &s;uch a face was &s;et upon the Bu&s;yne&s;s, as if it had been a Material Part of their Re|ligion to welcome this young Idoll into the world with the Sacrifice of more <HI>Christian</HI>-Bloud.</P>

<P>On the <HI>Chri&s;tians</HI> &s;ide, there was no good|will wanting toward the Relief of any of the&s;e Places; but all their Attempts fell &s;hort, by rea&s;on of many Fatalities, and Accidents Inter|vening.</P>
<P>The&s;e &s;ucce&s;&s;es encouraged the Enemy to draw nearer to the <HI>Mine-Towns,</HI> and to en|deavour the making of their <HI>Winter-Quarter</HI> thereabouts, and in <HI>&V;pper-Hungary.</HI> A Ru|mour was then di&s;per&s;ed that the <HI>Great Vizier</HI> had Commanded the Magi&s;trates of <HI>Fry&s;tadt,</HI> and the Neighbouring Parts, upon pain of death to make a <HI>Ship-bridge</HI> over the <HI>Waegh</HI> with all &s;peed, and to provide Victuals and Fodder to entertain him at his comming back.

<P>Count <HI>Serini,</HI> that till now, &s;taid in the I&s;le of <HI>Schutt.</HI> put him&s;elf In&s;tantly into Motion, and now and then, met with &s;ome Parties, and took good Booty from them; but ala&s;s?

<PB N="46" REF="10">
<P>In <HI>Comorra</HI> (where the Officers were at that time under Que&s;tion, and came off well, about the Surrender of <HI>Newhau&s;el</HI>) there were great Complaints of Scarcity of Provi&s;ion; the Country being &s;o mi&s;erably wa&s;ted round a|bout it. Whereupon, at <HI>Vienna</HI> it was taken into thought, how tho&s;e out-lying Garri&s;ons might be &s;upplyed, and the Enemy di&s;appoin|ted of their aime, who knew full well the State of their Nece&s;&s;ities. It is certain, that the <HI>Aux|iliaries</HI> and other Forces that were Quarter'd in <HI>Comorra,</HI> would much rather have kept the field, if all other Circum&s;tances would have permit|ted it; but tho&s;e <HI>Auxiliaries,</HI> who by too liberal Feeding on the <HI>Au&s;trian</HI> and <HI>Moravian</HI> Fruits, had contracted di&s;ea&s;es, neither could, nor would &s;tir; be&s;ide that their General, Count <HI>Hohenlo,</HI> a Prudent, Expert, and Judicious Commander, gave many weighty Rea&s;ons a|gain&s;t it. No &s;ooner had this Lord made an Ac|quaintance in <HI>Vienna;</HI> but ill Fortune met with him his Chamber being Robb'd of VVritings, Moneys, and Jewels, to the value of betwixt twenty and thirty thou&s;and; <HI>Rix Dollars.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Swedi&s;h Auxiliaries</HI> were not yet come up; but by Advice from <HI>Leip&s;ick,</HI> they were then upon their March not far from <HI>Thuringen,</HI> (about the mid&s;t of <HI>November</HI>) and 150. hor&s;e were likewi&s;e to come from <HI>Pomerania,</HI> which Forces became the Ground of great Mi&s;takes,

<P>The Rumour of the Return of the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Army, (now &s;o late in <HI>November</HI>) Encrea&s;ed more and more; at which time <HI>Filleck</HI> (Some ten mile from <HI>Ca&s;&s;aw</HI>) was given for lo&s;t; So that certain Regiments were immediately &s;ent to make good the other <HI>Mine-Townes,</HI> which the Enemy had particu|larly in their Eye for a <HI>Winter-Quarter.</HI> Tho&s;e <HI>Chri&s;tians</HI> which about this time ranfom'd them&s;elves from the <HI>Turks,</HI> &s;peak much of the Stupendious Preparations, which are now in hand again&s;t <HI>Chri&s;tendome;</HI> Affirming it for a Certainty, that the <HI>Grand Signior</HI> is re&s;olv'd to take the field next Spring with an Army of three hundred thou&s;and Men, which cau&s;es great per|plexities in <HI>Poband, Hungary, Moravia, Sile&s;ia,</HI> and <HI>Bohemia;</HI> but the <HI>Polanders,</HI> being at peace with the <HI>Turks,</HI> conceived them&s;elves in &s;ome mea&s;ure &s;ecured by virtue of that Agreement; but in the <HI>Tartars, Moldavians,</HI> and <HI>Walachians,</HI>
<PB N="48" REF="11">they have not much confidence: E&s;pecially, when they are upon their Excur&s;ions.

<P>The Enemy (who did nothing ra&s;hly, though as is generally &s;uppo&s;ed, rather acting
<PB N="49" REF="11">by <HI>In&s;tigation</HI> then <HI>choice</HI>) counted it mo&s;t ad|vi&s;eable to draw toward <HI>Ca&s;&s;aw</HI> the head City of <HI>&V;pper-hungary;</HI> knowing full well that when ever the <HI>Chri&s;tians</HI> &s;hould <HI>&V;nite,</HI> they would make this place the Seat of Warr, and &s;ettle them&s;elves There: VVherefore the <HI>In|fidels</HI> went roundly to work, removing what|&s;oever might hinder their Progre&s;&s;e, before a|ny &s;uccour could come up to them, which &s;uc|cour would however at la&s;t &s;ignify not much a|gain&s;t &s;o Potent an Enemy.</P>
<P>About this time, the <HI>Polanders</HI> were a little Frighted with the <HI>Tartars,</HI> who though return|ing homeward with their booty already got|ten, might yet be tempted by their greedine&s;s after more, to break into the <HI>Cracovian, Way|wood-&s;hip;</HI> and from thence to advance into <HI>Sile&s;ia,</HI> according to the old &s;aying, <HI>Si Turca veniet in Germaniam, Ibit per Poloniam.</HI> If the <HI>Turk</HI> comes into <HI>Germany,</HI> he &s;hall pa&s;&s;e through <HI>Poland.</HI> The&s;e Incarnat and Rapaci|ous Devils, however kept off yet, and carryed their prey to their <HI>Cavernes</HI> there to divide it.

<P>About this time the <HI>Turks</HI> cau&s;ed the late &s;ubdued <HI>Lewents</HI> to be demoli&s;h'd, as not lik|ing the manner of the Fortification, and &s;ent a Menacing Order to tho&s;e of <HI>Fry&s;tadt,</HI> to di&s;|patch out of hand two Bridges over the <HI>Waegh,</HI> larger then the former, and to make them broad enough for whole Squadrons to pa&s;&s;e a Brea&s;t; And now they began to talk loud of another Inva&s;ion into <HI>Moravia;</HI> to which end, many thou&s;ands of the <HI>Tawny-Tartars</HI> throng'd
<PB REF="12">into the Camp, as if tho&s;e of the other com|plexion, had not yet playd the devils &s;ufficient|ly in the Country; Whereupon to prevent that Inrode, a <HI>Counter-mand</HI> was &s;ent to mo&s;t of tho&s;e forces, that were now march'd, or march|ing off to their <HI>Winter-Quarters;</HI> and Order given them to bend their Cour&s;e toward the <HI>Waegh.</HI> Although this Countenance of the <HI>Turks</HI> de&s;ign gain'd not much Credit, in regard of the &s;ea&s;on of the Year, it was however held for good di&s;cretion not to be too &s;ecure.</P>
<P>Near the end of <HI>November,</HI> came to <HI>Vienna-Baron de Goes</HI> (with leave of the <HI>Great Vizier,</HI> and in company of a <HI>Turki&s;h Chiaux</HI> of <HI>Offen</HI>) who long time had been employ'd as the <HI>Em|perours</HI> Agent toward the intended Treaty for Peace; which <HI>Baron,</HI> Affirmes that the <HI>Grand Signior</HI> with the <HI>Tartar Cham,</HI> have re&s;olved, with an Incredible Force, to come per&s;onally into the Field next Spring; and Joyn the ut|mo&s;t of their power again&s;t <HI>Chri&s;tendome.</HI></P>
