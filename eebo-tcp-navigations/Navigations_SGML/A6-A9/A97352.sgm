<HEAD>TO THE GENTRIE OF GREAT BRITTAINE.</HEAD>
<P>_IT is an Argument of worthine&s;&s;e, to love worth in others, and vertue you know con&s;i&s;teth in action; &s;o that <HI>Gen|tlemen</HI> &s;hould be alwayes doing &s;ome worthy deede, or patronizing that which is done. If you therefore con|&s;ider the worthine&s;&s;e of the Author or Worke, you will joyne your helping hands to &s;upport <HI>Atlas</HI> groaning under the burthen of the world. <HI>Mercator</HI> drew the&s;e De&s;criptions of the Integrall parts of the <HI>World</HI> in <HI>Latine,</HI> but now they are drawne forth in <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> colours, which are but changeable accidents, for the re|all &s;ub&s;tance of <HI>Mercators</HI> World remaineth the &s;ame in that manner as he fa&s;hioned it. But of late with great care, co&s;t, and fidelitie, the&s;e De&s;criptions have beene con|verted into <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> with new additions and much enlar|ged, that the benefit thereof might have a larger extent, for <HI>bonum qu&ograve; communius eo melius,</HI> Good becomes better when it is communicable to all.

<HEAD>The Preface to the cour|teous Reader.</HEAD>
<P>_THat many &s;ollid and urgent rea&s;ons did en|duce them, who among the liberall Di&s;ci|plines which without controver&s;ie are very profitable to mans life, doe give the fir&s;t place to the noble Art of <HI>Geographie,</HI> they &s;hall be&s;t know and di&s;cerne, who &s;hall con|&s;ider both the excellencie, and plea&s;ure, as al&s;o the incredible profit of this Art. For, as concerning the digni|tie and excellencie thereof, it doth not intreate of meane matters of &s;mall moment, as brute <HI>bea&s;ts,</HI> the <HI>fruits</HI> of the <HI>Earth,</HI> pretious <HI>&s;tones, mettalls,</HI> and other workes of nature, the handling whereof no rea&s;onable man will contemne; but it pre&s;enteth to our &s;ight the whole Globe of the Earth as it were in a Mirrour or Looking-gla&s;&s;e, and doth &s;hew the beautie and ornaments of the whole Fabricke of the world, and containeth all things in her ample and &s;pacious bo&s;ome, and like the va&s;te Sea, it doth not onely open and lay forth the hidden and remote J&s;lands, but al&s;o all other Countries. To omit the neere affinitie which this noble Science hath with A&s;tronomie, which mounting above the earth doth contemplate the Heavens.</P>
<P>Moreover, if men as often as they heare &s;ome relation of this or that Country, of any &s;trange unknowne people, or of any rare and unu&s;uall Creature, or of the continuall burning of the Mountaine <HI>Aetna,</HI> al&s;o of divers J&s;lands lying here and there in the great Oce|an, and al&s;o of Salvage Nations, &s;ome whereof goe naked without cloathes, others feede on mans fle&s;h, and the like matters; or doe reade the wonderfull hi&s;tories of the Ea&s;t and We&s;t Jndies, (in which there are many things which doe rather &s;eeme fabulous than
<PB REF="5">
true) doe apprehend them with &s;uch great admiration, and give &s;uch earne&s;t attention thereunto, out of the de&s;ire which they have to heare &s;uch novelties; how much more may the curious Readers delight in this worke, which, as we &s;aid before, doth containe and repre&s;ent the whole Globe of the Earth, with all the Countries, Kingdomes, Do|minions, Woods, Mountaines, Valleys, Rivers, Lakes, People, Cit|ties and innumerable Townes thereof, with the Seas flowing about it: all which any one may here view on dry land, without endange|ring his body or goods; and in this travell his friends &s;hall not be &s;ol|licitous or take care for him in his ab&s;ence, or earne&s;tly de&s;ire his re|turne. Be&s;ides, in this peregrination or travell he &s;hall want no de|light that may drive away the tediou&s;ne&s;&s;e of the journey; for while he fixeth his eyes on &s;everall Countries and places, he &s;hall &s;traight way behold the &s;peciall gifts and peculiar excellencie of every Coun|try, and ob&s;erve a wonderfull variety therein, which are very delight|full to the mind, for as the Proverbe &s;aith, A good merry companion is as a Coach upon the way.</P>
<P>But they &s;hall chiefely di&s;cerne the great and manifold benefits of this Art of Geography, who in their eye-travell, and viewing of &s;everall Countryes, &s;hall con&s;ider the &s;cituation and di&s;po&s;ition of Countries, the Cu&s;tomes, ob&s;ervations, lawes, and manners of the In|habitants, and &s;hall afterwards traffique, and &s;end commodities to &s;everall places, or re&s;olve to &s;tudy the liberall Arts; &s;eeing no Poet, nor Hi&s;torian can be well read with profit, nor be conveniently ex|pounded or declared by any Interpreter or Commentator, without the helpe and knowledge of this mo&s;t Noble Science. J omit here to mention how ab&s;urd and unfit it is, that he who hath no skill nor knowledge in the&s;e matters, &s;hould give his opinion and judgement in the publicke a&s;&s;embly or councell of the Common-wealth, when con&s;ultation is held about the di&s;covery of &s;ome unknowne Country, or in time of warre concerning the bounds and confines of any Pro|vince.</P>
<P>But Princes and Noble men ought chiefely to be&s;tow great paines in &s;tuddying this mo&s;t excellent Art, in regard it may be very u&s;e|full unto them in undertaking journies and voyages when occa&s;ion requireth, as al&s;o at home for fortifying the Frontiers of their owne Territories, or the directing and conducting of any warlike expedi|tion. For that irrecoverable dangers have en&s;ued when an army hath beene led through places unknowne both to to the &s;ouldiers and
<PB REF="6">
Captaine, both <HI>Livy</HI> and many other Hi&s;toriographers have abun|dantly te&s;tified by cleere and manife&s;t examples.</P>
<P>And moreover, as it is very nece&s;&s;ary, profitable and plea&s;ant to know all Countries, Kingdomes, Dominions, and Provinces, with their &s;cituation, di&s;po&s;ition, and qualities; &s;o in like manner the &s;everall Seas, Rivers, Lakes, and memorable waters thereof, ought to be con&s;idered exactly in the&s;e times, when voyages are &s;o fre|quently made, unto knowne and unknowne Countries, &s;o that not a|ny one will continually re&s;ide at home, and ab&s;taine from making di&s;coveries both by Sea and Land. So that <HI>Polidore Virgils</HI> complaint is now vaine, who in the fifteenth chapter of the third Booke concerning the Invention of Matters, doth condemne mankind of too much ra&s;hne&s;&s;e, and madne&s;&s;e, in regard he cannot bridle his affections and de&s;ires with rea&s;on: and though God hath given him the Earth, being a firme and immovable element, abundantly pro|ducing all things nece&s;&s;ary and convenient for mans life, yet he be|ing not content therewith, hath made a Scrutiny and &s;earch into the &s;tarres, the heavens, and the va&s;te Seas. To the &s;ame purpo&s;e <HI>Ho|race</HI> &s;ung formerly, in his fir&s;t Booke, and third <HI>Ode:</HI></P>
<Q><L>He had a heart of Oake or Bra&s;&s;e,</L>
<L>Who did lanch forth a brittle &s;hip, to pa&s;&s;e</L>
<L>At fir&s;t through the rough Seas,</L>
<L>And did not feare, when he &s;et forth</L>
<L>The Affrick wind &s;triving with the North</L>
<L>wind, &amp;c.</L></Q>
<P><HI>And a little after in the &s;ame place:</HI></P>
<Q><L>No &s;ort of death he &s;ure did feare</L>
<L>That &s;aw the Mon&s;ters &s;wimming there,</L>
<L>And could behold them with drye eyes</L>
<L>With the &s;welling Sea and rockes which in it lyes.</L></Q>
<P><HI>And afterward he addeth;</HI></P>
<Q><L>In vaine did God divide the land</L>
<L>from the un&s;ociable Seas,</L>
<L>If impious &s;hips can &s;ayle unto</L>
<L>forbidden Ports when they doe plea&s;e.</L>
<L>But mankind bold &s;till to adventure</L>
<L>doth on forbidden mi&s;chiefe enter &amp;c.</L></Q>
<P>And hereunto <HI>Propertius</HI> in his third Booke doth allude, in that Elegie wherein he bewayleth <HI>Petus</HI> his Shipwracke, where he &s;ingeth thus:</P>
<Q><PB REF="6">
<L>Goe crooked &s;hippes, of death the fatall cau&s;e,</L>
<L>Which on him&s;elfe man with his owne hand drawes.</L>
<L>Vnto the earth, wee added have the Seas,</L>
<L>That the mi&s;eries of misfortunes may increa&s;e.</L></Q>
<P><HI>And a little after:</HI></P>
<Q><L>Nature to en&s;nare the covetous man,</L>
<L>Doth let him &s;ayle upon the Ocean.</L></Q>
<P>But the&s;e rea&s;ons are not able to di&s;courage any one, but rather to quicken their indu&s;try, greedily to take any occa&s;ion to know, view and di&s;cover divers Countries both neerehand and remote; partly by undertaking long voyages: and tho&s;e that cannot conveniently travell, may gather the knowledge of all Countries out of Bookes and exact de&s;criptions. And truely that &s;tuddy is irreproveable, &s;o that it ought rather to be accounted laudible, profitable, plea&s;ant and nece&s;&s;ary. For <HI>Strabo</HI> in the fir&s;t Book of his Geography &s;aith right|ly, that man ought to live on the Sea as well as on the land, and that God made him equally an Inhabitant and Lord thereof. Therefore they de&s;erve great prai&s;e, who have laboured in this Art, as <HI>Abra|ham Or<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">elius, Daniel Cellarius, Anthony Maginus, Paul Merula, Peter Bertius</HI> and others: but e&s;pecially that mo&s;t lear|ned Mathematician <HI>Gerard Mercator,</HI> although he were preven|ted by death, &s;o that he could not fini&s;h his Geographicall worke, in|tituled <HI>Atlas.</HI> But <HI>Iodocus Hondy</HI> did &s;upply this defect; ad|ding not onely tho&s;e Tables which were wanting to make the worke perfect, but al&s;o accurate de&s;criptions thereof, by the labour and &s;tud|dy of <HI>Peter Montane.</HI> This worke we doe publi&s;h againe in this new Edition, being accurately reui&s;ed, and purged from many gro&s;&s;e errours; and the &s;tudious Reader &s;hall finde that the enlargement of this Booke is not to be contemn'd, being &s;et forth with divers ad|ditions, and &s;ome new Tables added, as he may &s;ee in the de&s;criptions of <HI>England, Ireland, Spaine, Frie&s;land, Groonland, Vltra|jectum,</HI> and other Countries, that &s;hall compare this Edition with the former.

<HEAD>Concerning the u&s;e of the&s;e Tables.</HEAD>
<P><HI>_PTolomie</HI> and we in this booke, doe make the Longitude to be a &s;egment of the Aequator, or Aequinoctiall Circle, com|prehended with the Meridian of that place, and the Meridi|an of the Fortunate I&s;lands: for from the&s;e I&s;lands the beginning of Longitude is taken.</P>
<P>Some doe not begin the Longitude from the Fortunate I&s;lands (which are now called the Canaries) but from the Flandrian I&s;lands, which are now called the <HI>Azores,</HI> becau&s;e the needle of the compa&s;&s;e doth point there directly toward the North. But the &s;uperficies of the Globe contayneth in Longitude 360 degrees.</P>
<P>The Latitude is the Arch or Segment of any place betweene the Aequinoctiall and Parralell which is drawne through the verticall point of the &s;ame place, and it is alwayes to the elevation of the Pole.</P>
<P>Latitude is twofold, either Northerne, or Southerne, and there are reckoned from the Aequinoctiall to either Pole 90 degrees of Latitude.</P>
<P>We have noted the degrees of Longitude and Latitude on the &s;ides of all the Tables, and for the mo&s;t part, the degrees of Lati|tude on the toppe and bottome, and of Longitude on the right and left hand, except when &s;ome Country is to be de&s;cribed that is more extended betweene the South and North.</P>
<P>The &s;everall degrees both of Longitude and Latitude, according to the capacitie of the place, are &s;ometimes divided into 60, &s;ome|times into 10. 6. or 5. parts, which are called minutes, and we have noted the degrees with greater Arithmeticall figures, and the mi|nutes with le&s;&s;er for difference &s;ake.</P>
<P>If one would finde out the Longitude and Latitude of any place, where the Meridian Parralells are, by taking with a paire of com|pa&s;&s;es the di&s;tance thereof from the &s;ide of the Table, and afterward by applying the compa&s;&s;es to the other &s;ide. If thou take&s;t the di|&s;tance from the Ea&s;t &s;ide, the compa&s;&s;es being turned from that &s;ide to the North &s;ide, will &s;hew the degree and minute of Longitude. If thou ha&s;t the di&s;tance from the North-&s;ide, turne thy compa&s;&s;es from thence to the Ea&s;t &s;ide, and it will &s;hew the Latitude. But if the Meridians be not Parralells, the Latitude of a place is found in the &s;ame manner, but in the Vniver&s;all Tables where the Parralells are circular, the di&s;tance of a place being taken from the next &s;ide, will &s;hew the &s;ame on the Ea&s;t &s;ide. But the Longitude is to bee taken with a thred or Ruler, layd upon the place and turned untill it doe point out on the Northerne and Southerne &s;ide, the &s;ame minute of the &s;ame degree, and where&s;oever it be, that is the Longitude of the place.</P>

<PB REF="10">
<HEAD>How to finde out the di&s;tance of degrees or Miles betweene two Citties, or any other Places.</HEAD>
<P>_WE have added &s;cales of Miles to all the Tables, by which thou may&s;t ea&s;ily finde out the di&s;tance of all places in this mannner.</P>
<P>Take a paire of Compa&s;&s;es, and open them untill the <HI>2</HI> feete doe touch the extreame points of the places given, then appy them without any alteration to the &s;cale of miles, and the numerall figures noted there|on will give the di&s;tance.</P>
<P>But if the Di&s;tance of places doth exceede the length of the Scale, then with thy compa&s;ses thou &s;halt take the length of the Scale, and thou &s;halt turne the Compa&s;&s;es from one place to another, as farre as the di&s;tance of places will permit, and then reckon the miles together. But becau&s;e the length of miles in all Countryes is unknowne, thou &s;halt more certainely take the di&s;tance of places with thy Compa&s;&s;es, and apply the Compa&s;&s;es without variation to the degrees of Latitude, which will give the true di&s;tance, by multiplying them by the Miles of the knowne Country.</P>
<P>But the Miles doe differ much in divers Countries, and therefore I will here in&s;ert their difference in the chiefe Countryes.</P>

<HEAD><HI>The fir&s;t Chapter.</HI> The &s;cope of all Co&s;mographie.</HEAD>
<P>_IT is a common Axiom among tho&s;e, who are in any wi&s;e elevated in the contemplation of the worke of this frame of the world, that God who is the Author thereof, is of an immen&s;e power, wi&s;dome, and goodne&s;&s;e, and it is im|po&s;&s;ible that a man &s;hould doubt of his power, who belee|veth that created of nothing, and that the matter thereof is not eternall. If there be any man, to whom this power and goodne&s;&s;e of God doth not &s;ufficiently appeare, as not ha|ving yet con&s;idered well the commendable, exqui&s;ite, and mo&s;t wi&s;e ornament, and di&s;po&s;ition of this Fabricke, let him then diligently enquire with us, &s;o farre as the contemplation of the workeman|&s;hip it &s;elfe may per&s;wade him, and as farre as is lawfull to know by the Word of God, and the experience of things. For this is the maine &s;cope we ayme at, that in handling Co&s;mographie, the infinite wi&s;dome of God, and his inexhau&s;t goodne&s;&s;e, may be knowne, as well by the admirable concordancy of all things to one and the &s;ame end of God, as al&s;o by his in&s;crutable providence in the compo&s;ition, whereby wee may bee continually rapt up to reverence and honour his Maje&s;ty, and to em|brace his rich goodne&s;&s;e. God grant then, that he will be plea&s;ed, to enlighten our darke under&s;tandings with his light, and direct our mindes, to the finding out of this true wi&s;dome. It is &s;o then, that this immen&s;e goodne&s;&s;e of God, not able to containe his owne glory in him&s;elfe, by rea&s;on of &s;uperabundant fecunditie to beget, was willing to create man, to whom hee communicated the &s;ame, and having conceived in his wi&s;edome, to inve&s;t him a body, &s;uch as we &s;ee, as his fir&s;t Creation &s;heweth him to be, Created and brought forth the world by his Almighty power, and dige&s;ted it into that order, nature, and proportion, according to that <HI>Idea,</HI> which he from all E|ternity had conceived, furni&s;hed with all parts nece&s;&s;ary for the u&s;e of man, &s;o crea|ted. Therefore the cheife end of the workes of God, and his primary intention, was to communicate his glory. The &s;econd was the creation of man. The third, the di&s;po&s;ition of all things in the world, and the la&s;t drift of his intention, was the be|ginning of the worke. It behoveth him then, that will undertake the de&s;cription of the world, to beginne at its fir&s;t <HI>exordium,</HI> who would profitably extend it to Phy|lo&s;ophie.</P>
<P>Curious men were wont to aske, fir&s;t what God did before he Created the world, how and where he was then, when as yet there was neither place, nor time? &s;econdly,

why he did not Create the world many Ages before? and wherefore he did not make man &s;o perfect, that he could not fall? to which frivolous and ra&s;h que&s;tions, he will ea|&s;ily an&s;wer who hath knowledge as farre as the Scriptures and the worke of God tea|cheth us of the &s;acred Trinity, and who &s;hall diligently ob&s;erve the true definitions of time, and place: but this impiety, and wickedne&s;&s;e of men are not worthy the an&s;we|ring; for it is religion, not to pry further into the hidden &s;ecrets and judgements of God, then he hath revealed unto us in his holy Word, and to di&s;pute of things that are out of our element, and before the world was, and of things that are above our reach and capacity, is meere madne&s;&s;e and folly: &s;eeing they beget onely opinions, not &s;ciences, and therfore can bring no true wi&s;edome along with them: but rather produce &s;trange doctrines, which ob&s;cure and darken the truth. Let it &s;uffice us then, to know the truth o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hings, &s;o farre forth, as hi&s;tory and &s;en&s;e reveales them to us, and not according to opinions, whereof there is no &s;cience, and in &s;o doing, we &s;hall not erre, if we onely proceed in a right order.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of God, the beginning and Workemaster of all thing<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, according to the Platoni&s;ts.</HEAD>
<P>_THE Platoni&s;ts from the communion of the <HI>Species,</HI> which is di|&s;cerned in things, and in the order, which appeared in them, have a&s;cended unto that one, who is the fir&s;t, and the beginning of all things, that is (according as <HI>Paul</HI> &s;aith. <HI>Rom.</HI> 1.20.) that in be|holding the di&s;po&s;ition, and mo&s;t adorned harmonie of all things, perceived after &s;ome manner in them, the exi&s;tence of &s;ome Pro|vidence and under&s;tanding them to be the worke of &s;ome one; have attained &s;o farre, that they were drawne, as well to the me|ditating of them, as to the affirming their Creation. Fir&s;t of all, in that they make the intellect or Spirit Fabricator of the world, out of this one, and di&s;tingui&s;h him entirely from him, and make him another afterwards. Againe, in this, that &s;eparating the matter it &s;elfe from all forme, they under&s;tand it not to be the generation of any <HI>Idea:</HI> for <HI>Ideas</HI> are &s;pecies or formes, which can engender nothing but formes, and &s;o
<PB N="3" REF="13">
con&s;equently mu&s;t of nece&s;&s;ity follow, that they under&s;tand it, not to have beene Created, but that it is eternall. The originall of this errour is, becau&s;e they beleeved the matter was onely &s;u&s;ceptible of formes, and that it had no communion with the formes of nature, and therefore have not onely once dreamed, that it was in the &s;eedes of formes, and that the force thereof might be conducted by the worker. Whence they were at length con&s;trained to con&s;titute a certaine perpetuall, and a formall be|ginning out of the matter. By the &s;ame rea&s;on, they were induced to &s;et downe one &s;elfe-&s;ame out of one, and diver&s;e from him, &s;o cutting too neere the quicke, and &s;poyling this one, and primary beginning of all things out of this one, begotten of one, but di&s;tinct in E&s;&s;ence and propriety of nature, from whom alone as from the Father, fir&s;t, and immediately depended the fir&s;t modell of the worke of the world, and of the immediate vertue <HI>formatrix</HI> of things. The traces of which doctrine <HI>Valentine</HI> follow|ing added other fancies unto it, having found out a meane, whereby one, whom he calleth <HI>Proarch</HI> and <HI>Bythum,</HI> hath proceeded to the generation of the Spirit, and by &s;ome generation comming betwixt afterwards. Finally, deducing it to the Creation, a&s;well of the matter, as of all things, and even mixing therewith this prodigious Philo|&s;ophie of <HI>Pythagoras,</HI> whom his di&s;ciples following, taught the &s;ame doctrine in ob|&s;curing and adulterating the truth in all parts; more then with old wives fables, but &s;eeing the raving of the&s;e men, vani&s;hed of it &s;elfe, we will rather have re&s;pect to the Theology of the Platoni&s;ts, and to the originall of the world, the which as it hath more appearance of divinity, then all others, and &s;eemeth to come neere to the <HI>Mo&s;aicall</HI> truth: &s;o likewi&s;e it may more ea&s;ily draw us to true and &s;acred Philo&s;ophy. And therefore in propounding a briefe &s;umme thereof, we will oppo&s;e again&s;t it a true narration of things drawne as well from the &s;ecrets of the holy Scripture, as from nature, confirming the one, by &s;olid rea&s;ons, and rejecting the other wherein it &s;tray|eth from the truth; to the end that under the colour of a more divine Theologie, the eyes of under&s;tanding be not dazled in the &s;earch of this philo&s;ophy, wherein much fal&s;itie is contained. That it may al&s;o appeare to all men, that among the <HI>Ethnicks,</HI> there was never Schoole &s;o holy, no care &s;o fervent, no wit &s;o excellent, that by their owne indu&s;trie could attaine unto the truth of things; con&s;idering al&s;o the mo&s;t Religious a|mong them, even the Platoni&s;ts them&s;elves wandred a&s;tray, and mini&s;tred matter of er|ring to others. Wherfore let us give thankes unto God alone, who is the beginning, the Creatour, the Animatour, the Con&s;ervatour, and the end of the worke of the world: And that it plea&s;ed him by <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> and his other Prophets to reveale unto us the Fa|bricke of the vniver&s;e, the beginning and fountaine of all Philo&s;ophy and of all truth.</P>

<P>And <HI>Plato,</HI> It is hard to finde a God, but to under|&s;tand him unpo&s;sible. <HI>The Spirit.</HI></P></NOTE> in things divine, to wit, one Spirit and Soule which are called in their fables <HI>Coelus, Sa|turnus</HI> and <HI>Iupiter:</HI> following one another in order. The chiefe&s;t whereof is he, whom they make to be their fir&s;t and Soveraine God. Him they call one, in regard of his mo&s;t &s;imple e&s;&s;ence, and good by rea&s;on of his &s;uperabundant fruitfulne&s;&s;e to engender, and facility to communicate him&s;elf: they de&s;cribe him to be, neither being, nor e&s;&s;ence, nei|ther intellect, nor good, adjectively: neither to under&s;tand no not him&s;elfe, neither to live nor to move, but to be above all the&s;e things, that is, the beginning and originall of being, and e&s;&s;ence of intellect, and of intelligence, of life, and of motion, and the fir&s;t and &s;upreme of all things, that may be apprehended, be&s;ide him&s;elf. Again, that he hath no|thing in him&s;elfe, that he differeth from all things, that he con&s;i&s;teth in him&s;elfe, and cannot be mixed with things &s;equent, and yet neverthele&s;&s;e that he is pre&s;ent in all things, and that he containeth all things, and in like manner he is every where and yet no where, that is to &s;ay, he hath no neede of any place, neither is he finite, nor determi|ned, neither within, nor without, but is the power of all things: yea the greate&s;t power of all powers, and yet is not all things, but above all things.</P>
<P>That this one or good, produceth from his owne abundance, not by con&s;ent of any cogitation, not by any coun&s;ell, not by any determinate will, not being moved by any meanes, but abiding in his owne habitude, by his owne peculiar perfection, accom|panyed by a potentiall act, or an efficacious power, internally hee created a beame, which hee di&s;pear&s;eth almo&s;t like the Sunne, that abiding one and the &s;ame immove|able, &s;preadeth its light, which beame in a&s;much that on a &s;udden, it is made that which it is, abiding in him, it becommeth a being, but in that it is converted naturally to the Parent, whence it received its motion, it is made living, from

An Internall act, (I &s;ay) of his e&s;&s;ence, having evermore an eye to his power, and knowing determinately things, which were hidden, without addition of Intel|ligence, &s;o (I &s;ay) he conceiveth in his under&s;tanding the <HI>Ideas,</HI> or formative &s;pecies of all things, which they call intelligible gods, and engendreth them in &s;ome &s;ort. Di&s;tingui&s;hed by a formall rea&s;on, but the &s;ame in e&s;&s;ence, as many exi&s;tents One. I &s;ay not One, and many, but One many, as <HI>Parmenedes</HI> will have it, for the le&s;&s;e nume|rous unity, as well in the thought, as in the &s;oule, and as the Intellect is repleni&s;hed with power received from One: &s;o likewi&s;e being full of <HI>Ideas,</HI> or the formes of all things remaine one and the &s;ame with them, all beings exi&s;ting in this, and them true, becau&s;e they are immutable and eternall, which as <HI>Saturne</HI> &s;uddenly &s;walloweth them up, as being engendred from him, and in him, &s;uffering them to fall into the matter of things naturall and fraile: but keepeth all things in him&s;elfe, and contai|neth without di&s;&s;olution or partition, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;eth all things in one, being pre&s;ent al&s;o to all things, and in all places, and yet neverthele&s;&s;e is not in them, but they in him, as depending of him, and con&s;i&s;ting in him.

For it is not di&s;per&s;ed di&s;tinctly into many things, according to his internall alteritie, but procreateth one onely, according to the &s;emi|nall rea&s;ons, being already by act, and power many together, to wit, the Soule, where|of we &s;hall come to &s;peake immediately. They tearme this intellect, the great God, the &s;econd God, and be&s;ides not any, but All God, from whom as from the primary, and &s;ole all-being, all beings immediately obtaine their e&s;&s;ence, and therefore all gods. They call this al&s;o the word of God, and an act produced from the &s;ame good, and againe the Image of God, becau&s;e it imitateth the goodne&s;&s;e of his begetter, with all his &s;trength, by a copious and a fruitefull propriety to engender, which forces &s;ee|ing he receiveth them from his Begetter, are yet &s;o conjoyned to him, that it &s;eemeth onely to be di&s;tingui&s;hed from him, by a certaine alterity. And <HI>Plato</HI> calleth it <HI>Idea,</HI> becau&s;e it comprehendeth in its e&s;&s;ence the Patterne and &s;ole individuall &s;pecies of all things.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Soule.</NOTE>The generation of this Spirit is the Soule of the world, the third God, no otherwi&s;e proceeded from thence, then it from one, for it &s;elfe is the word of the Spirit.

<P>The Platoni&s;ts then a&s;cribe to Divine things, the&s;e three beginnings in the &s;ame manner, as I have declared them. As for the fir&s;t, they doe not agree, that it is an act of &s;ome One (as it ought not to be) or that it hath any action: yet they grant that it is <HI>potentiall,</HI> that is to &s;ay, that it hath the power to produce; retayning the &s;implicity of One. But that the Intellect, is is an act flowing from one. And that the Soule al&s;o is an Act from this &s;ame intellect, and that both the one, and the other, are differing from him, from whom they proceed. That he al&s;o who begetteth is greater, and better then he which is begotten of him: and therefore the intellect is le&s;&s;e, and wor&s;e then the One; but that it is better, and greater then the Soule, and likewi&s;e the Soule then the Species, which it produceth. This is the meaning of all the Platonicke-Theologie, again&s;t which we will heere oppo&s;e that which is more true.</P>

Now therefore the Father, the Word, or the Sonne, and the Holy Gho&s;t, which are one: not becau&s;e they are of one e&s;&s;ence in number, for con&s;idering that they are in&s;eparable in him&s;elfe, and all the hidden &s;ciences of the Father, &s;hineth in the Word as by an eternall gene|ration, in &s;uch &s;ort, that the Word is the &s;hining Character and expre&s;&s;e e&s;&s;ence of the Father, and this &s;ame e&s;&s;ence &s;hineth from the Father by the Word, in all the univer&s;e, the &s;plendour whereof is the holy Spirit. The&s;e three have one and the &s;ame Deity, omnipotency, vertue, wi&s;dome, goodne&s;&s;e, will, and may in no wi&s;e be called three. Seeing their force, power, and action, is but one in number, as the Sonne teacheth us. <HI>Iohn</HI> the 17. &s;peaking thus of his Father. <HI>All mine are thine, and thine are mine,</HI> be|&s;ides, <HI>the Father that dwelleth in me he doth the workes, Iohn</HI> 14.10. and <HI>Iohn</HI> 5. <HI>My Fa|ther worketh hitherto, and I worke al&s;o.</HI> It is al&s;o mo&s;t manife&s;t by the &s;acred Scriptures, that the holy Gho&s;t, the Father, and the Sonne, worke all things.

&s;ub&s;i&s;tances, or Per&s;ons, but which differ not in e&s;&s;ence, neither are divided among them&s;elves, neither by le&s;&s;er con&s;equents, are wor&s;er in order, as the Platoni&s;ts make him, but all equall in Divinity, Eternity, Power, and efficacy; the Propriety of who&s;e e&s;&s;ence is neither le&s;&s;e nor more then the other, but equally nece&s;&s;ary to the Creation of all things. For in every worke three things are nece&s;&s;ary in a worker, Power, or beginning of the internall Act, the Conception and the Di&s;po&s;ition of the Act, or the Internall worker, and the i&s;&s;ue of the Act. Even as in fire, the beginning of the heate, is the nature, or forme of the fire, the act of it, is the internall heate. The Action, or act proceeding is the heate, which commeth out of it. And the Soule is the beginning and motive power, it is the di&s;po&s;ition, or will to move, it is finally the motion it &s;elfe. But becau&s;e that God hath not created the world, either by chance, or through ignorance, &s;earching the meanes how, or wi&s;edome, but with a great deale of Pru|dence, and wi&s;edome, it cannot be denied, but that from all eternity, he had concei|ved &s;ome certaine determinate modell,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Creati|on of the world peculi|arly belong+eth to God the Father.</NOTE> and all the Idea's of his workes, to which we give not beginning in the Word, as <HI>Plato</HI> doth, but to the Parent of the world, con&s;i|dering that what&s;oever the Sonne hath, he hath it from his Father, and for this cau&s;e we will place the Father fir&s;t, as the Seminary rea&s;on of the world, the Sonne, the force vegetative, the Holy Gho&s;t, the vertue Productive, and animative, the which with him proceeding from the Father, and being &s;hed out by the Sonne, it pa&s;&s;eth in|to a worke. So, the Holy Gho&s;t, which is abounding in the Father, awakeneth this Almighty and inexhau&s;t fountaine of the Eather, and the immen&s;e fecundity of the Sonne encites him (as it were) to budde forth, and by the quickning &s;piration of his holy Spirit, the Father begetteth the world, by a meane and &s;eminall rea&s;on, having conceived it, gives it to his Sonne, as he who properly expre&s;&s;eth the Father, from the Sonne already by act the world is brought forth, but by the meanes of the Holy Gho&s;t as being the Chariot, whereby the world &s;preadeth it &s;elfe, through its parts, and is animated in all things according to the proper Idea of every one of them. Now the Spi|rit accompanyeth the worke alwayes, and in all things, to the end that that which is conceived by the impregnant activity, and formed by the quickning motion thereof, is al&s;o con&s;erved by the &s;ame: It accompanies not then all things in &s;uch &s;ort, that therefore it is divided into parts, but indivi&s;ibly, and in the &s;ame manner as the Pla|toni&s;ts call it, the Soule of the world to be pre&s;ent in all things, and is not &s;o &s;evered from them, that it becomes, either the Soule, or the forme of every one, but abideth in him&s;elfe, and in all things pre&s;ent, and divers, and &s;eparated from all, hee formeth all things at once by the Power of the Father, by the Act of the Sonne, every one in his e&s;&s;ence, and forme, accompli&s;hing by degrees, both the e&s;&s;ence, and the matter, accor|ding to the rea&s;on of the modell, and afterwards appropriateth all things, according to the law, conceived of the Father.</P>

<PB N="8" REF="16">
Herein wee will follow the text of <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> con&s;idering it particularly, and dili|gently, according to the gift of grace which I have received from the Lord. In the beginning (&s;aith he) that is, when as yet there was nothing created, and that the di|vine Maje&s;tie, by the coun&s;ell, and determinate lawes propo&s;ed to begin the Creation. In the fir&s;t point (I &s;ay) and moment of their exi&s;tence of things, which yet were as nothing, but a beginning onely of things, without any forme, or condition of things, or of exi&s;tence, even (I &s;ay) in the moment of time, he begun to create: and after God created without any prepared matter, by his immen&s;e, and incomprehen&s;ible power this huge ma&s;&s;e, which was without forme, rude, and confu&s;ed, out of which hee after|wards drew all the parts and members of the world. In this creation of matter, as al|&s;o in that which en&s;ueth, three things were nece&s;&s;arie. The fruitfulne&s;&s;e of the Pater|nall power, the effectuall and pregnant power of the Word, and the force fructifying, conceiving and quickning of the holy Spirit, for the matter extracted had the beginning of its exi&s;tence from the power of God, as from a Seminarie rea&s;on, by the fructifying vertue of the holy Spirit, both formed it, and brought it into being, even as the fruit in the belly, and being at la&s;t hatched by the power of God, quickning, and nouri&s;hing, the &s;ame, is made manife&s;t. So the onely God Almightie, conceived, formed, and brought forth into the light, out of nothing in the vigour of his triplicitie, and without the a&s;&s;umption of any &s;ubject, the matter of all things, which were to be created, not by the operation fir&s;t of the Father, afterwards of the Word, and finally of the holy Gho&s;t; but all working, and con&s;piring jointly together in&s;eparably, and unce&s;&s;antly, among them&s;elves in the unitie of the divine e&s;&s;ence. Now this which is &s;aid, In the be|ginning, ought to be &s;o under&s;tood, as <HI>E&s;dras</HI> doth, <HI>lib.</HI> 4. <HI>Cap.</HI> 6. &s;aying: <HI>O Lord thou ha&s;t &s;poken from the beginning of thy creature, &s;aying, Let it be made, &amp;c.</HI> Now in that hee &s;aith from the beginning of the Creature, he &s;heweth &s;ufficiently, that this beginning or originall, ought not to be under&s;tood of the Son of God, but of the fir&s;t moment of the Creation, which is al&s;o manife&s;t, as well by the prepo&s;ition, as by the con|&s;truction of the words, In the beginning, and Creature, for to joyne this verbe; Thou ha&s;t &s;poken, with that of creature, the thing it &s;elfe contradicteth it: &s;eeing the creature was not yet in being, to which God might &s;peake. Moreover for as much as <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> (as I have &s;aid) wrote deliberately again&s;t the Gentiles, &s;etting downe a beginning to the world. This beginning can be no otherwi&s;e under&s;tood, then as wee have interpreted it: for if he had &s;aid, to have created in his Sonne (which is al&s;o true) and meaneth thereby no other thing, whence then can we gather an argu|ment again&s;t the Eternity of the world, or of its matter, &s;eeing the beginning it &s;elfe is eternall. <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> &s;peaketh &s;imply of a temporall beginning, and not otherwi&s;e.</P>
<P><HI>By the heaven and the earth,</HI> he under&s;tandeth not two di&s;tinct and different bodies, &s;ignified at this day by the names of heaven and earth, for then neither heaven nor earth had their beings, according to their proper forme, but that heaven was made the &s;econd day, and the earth la&s;t appeared, the third day; the waters being &s;eparated, af|terward the other parts of the world, created of this Primative ma&s;&s;e were reduced into order. By the heaven and the earth then, he under&s;tandeth figuratively, this fir&s;t ma&s;&s;e without forme, wherof the heaven and earth were formed. <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> then had to do with the Gentiles, to whom he te&s;tifieth, that the heaven and the earth which we be|hold had heretofore beene created of God, as he will &s;hew afterward, and u&s;eth names and things knowne, the better to leade men to the con&s;ideration of their beginning. For <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> meaning was, to pull out of all humane under&s;tandings, all Rap&s;odies of Philo&s;ophers, and their fal&s;e doctrine, touching the eternitie of the world, and its mat|ter, and by this way to &s;ubmit it to the glory of God, as he &s;ilently &s;heweth in his &s;e|cond and fourth Chapter. But, he taketh the heaven and the earth figuratively for the matter of them. The&s;e Epithites following demand it, <HI>Thohu</HI> and <HI>Bohu,</HI> which hee attributeth to the &s;ame ma&s;&s;e, created fir&s;t of all: becau&s;e it was without forme, va&s;t, void, &s;olitary and vacant, &amp; doth not adjoyne tho&s;e Epithites to the heaven and earth, but to the earth onely, carrying the Reader by this meanes, from the contemplation of perfect bodies, to their primarie matter, and hereby under&s;tandeth, not the earth one|ly in her forme; but this indige&s;ted and deformed Chaos, u&s;ing neverthele&s;&s;e the word earth, becau&s;e it better re&s;embleth the condition of the earth, when he continueth the de&s;cription of this ma&s;&s;e, and calls it <HI>The Hom,</HI> that is to &s;ay an <HI>Abi&s;&s;e.</HI> And &s;o by de|grees con&s;traineth the under&s;tanding of a contemplating man; yet being void of all

<P>_NOw after that all things were made, all men may ea&s;ily under&s;tand the end, which God propo&s;ed touching the Chaos, to wit, that he might divide it, and forme out of it, as many &s;pecies of things, as he from all eternitie had pecreed to be nece&s;&s;ary for the Oeconomy and government of the world, and gave &amp; e&s;tabli&s;h to all things at once, their force and law, that it might abide immoveable to the end for which he ordained all things. But, for as much as hee created all other things for mans u&s;e, and &s;ubjected them to him, till the time &s;hall come when as hee will tran&s;port mankinde into his heavenly man&s;ion<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">; as <HI>Paul</HI> teacheth us in the 8. of the Romanes. This mo&s;t wi&s;e Architect, created and con&s;tituted them to &s;uch an order, that by a &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive &s;ervice and a &s;weet harmony, they &s;hould all be &s;erviceable to man: which harmonie chiefely con&s;i&s;teth herein, that the &s;uperior cau&s;es rule over the inferior, and that all effects pa&s;&s;e the chiefe cau&s;es by the meane&s;t and lowe&s;t. Afterward al&s;o in this, that there is a mutuall inclination in all things, ac|cording to the con&s;equence of cau&s;es and effects and as it were a certaine love, where|by inferior things re&s;pect their &s;uperiours, as their Benefactors: and likewi&s;e the Su|periour the Inferiors, as receiving al&s;o &s;ome benefit from them. And albeit it com|meth to pa&s;&s;e in the&s;e two conditions of nature, that there is &s;ome contrarietie and &s;trife found in the meaner &s;pecies of things: Neverthele&s;&s;e, every one of them agree well together in their order, and have their recour&s;e to the primary cau&s;e, as to their center, and yeeld their &s;ervice, both to God their Ceatour, and to man: So that all things ac|cording to their proper office, agree together among them&s;elves; but of the&s;e things we will &s;peake more at large hereafter. For the pre&s;ent, I will adverti&s;e the Reader to ob&s;erve well and diligently in the creation of things, to wit, that thou maie&s;t know by what order, of what things, and how, and by what meanes God worketh; and &s;o thou &s;halt learne that which ought to be fir&s;t in all the government of nature; and that which ought to be la&s;t, what the cau&s;es of workes are, what the generations of all things are, and al&s;o the definition of things and their natures, their &s;impathies, and antipathies, their differences in &s;trength, and debilitie, their nobilitie, and igno|bility, what is of durance, and what in corruptible, with many others. For what&s;o|ever may be di&s;puted of the nature of things dependeth on their generations and pri|mary creation. He that can comprehend let him comprehend. There are many things that are very difficult, in the &s;earching of them out: neverthele&s;&s;e, man by a deepe &s;peculation can reach high, principally, when after having invocated the holy Gho&s;t, his maine end and &s;earch be, to glorifie God in his workes. Thou mai&s;t here al&s;o well ob&s;erve, the meaning of things naturall, and another order in the worke of nature, than that which the Philo&s;ophers have caught, which was impo&s;&s;ible for them to con|ceive

by their naturall rea&s;on, the beginning of the world, in &s;uch &s;ort, as <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> hath de&s;cribed them unto us: but let us put our Chariot againe into the right way. The Chaos being created, fir&s;t it is to be thought upon, how God fir&s;t of all did di&s;po&s;e thereof. Above all things it is nece&s;&s;ary, fir&s;t of all to a&s;&s;igne it a fixed place, for wee &s;ee that the heavie&s;t of all bodies is the earth, to which this ma&s;&s;e hath a better re&s;em|blance than to the heaven. Now had it not bin in a fixed place, it might ea&s;ily have fallen into an infinite of pieces, the weight alwayes urging the motion. But to the end he may here marke well the beginning of things, let him well ob&s;erve, that God of the mo&s;t ba&s;e&s;t and gro&s;e&s;t Element, of the mo&s;t illfavoured&s;t, and without any forme begin|neth his creation by little and little, mounting up to the highe&s;t, to the noble&s;t, and to the divine&s;t things. Ob&s;erve likewi&s;e, he beginneth with the mo&s;t &s;olid, and mo&s;t firme bodies, that the things which ought to be prepared appertaining to the life and perfection of creatures, which are all fraile, and changeable, to the end (I &s;ay) that all the&s;e things might have a firme &s;ubject to which they might be fa&s;tened and made firme: he a&s;&s;igned them a place for the earth and the Chaos, to wit, a point in the mid&s;t of the void, upon which it re&s;ted, and beyond which it is not permitted to move. This is the greate&s;t miracle of all nature, &s;urpa&s;&s;ing the capacitie of man, and humane cre|dence: were it not that the wheeling cour&s;e of the &s;tarres, and the navigations round about the world, did not manife&s;tly witne&s;&s;e the &s;ame for who could beleeve, that &s;o ponderous a weight could &s;ub&s;i&s;t hanging in the mid&s;t of the Heaven? and yet the truth thereof makes us beleeve it, who is hee that could under&s;tand, that &s;o huge and &s;o heavie a ma&s;&s;e can &s;ub&s;i&s;t, and without any &s;upporter &s;ettle it &s;elfe? What man is he that can imagine that it hath a foundation there where it hath no underpropping? Rightly did God then di&s;puting with <HI>Iob,</HI> in the mid&s;t of his angui&s;h demand of him, if he under&s;tood where he laid the foundations of the earth, he &s;hould declare it, <HI>Iob</HI> 38.4. Here is the in&s;crutable wi&s;edome of God, and his incomparable power, therefore it is not po&s;&s;ible for a man to give a &s;ound rea&s;on touching this goundwork, but onely the will of God, who followeth the cau&s;es &amp; rea&s;ons which are hidden in him&s;elf, and whom all things mu&s;t obey. As he willed, &s;o it was done, his will mini&s;ters him matter for the framing and forming of all things, his will from one &s;ole body, from one onely forme, fa&s;hioneth many of divers formes; from that which is without life, and with|out any activity, hee produceth it immediatly into force and vegetative vigour, into life, motion, &s;en&s;e and intelligence, and which is more, all things which he created, are &s;o tied, and agree together, by a mutuall love, whereunto all things tend, that hee cau&s;eth them by the &s;ole impre&s;&s;ion of his will, to have a naturall affection, and a cer|taine inclination to that dutie which is imprinted in them, according to their Creators will, by the harmonious con&s;ent of the <HI>Ideas</HI> in the divine thought: So this Chaos, and above all that which is the heavie&s;t in it, to wit, the earth de&s;ireth unce&s;&s;antly the point which is a&s;&s;igned to it in this vacuitie, by an impre&s;&s;ion from the will of God, and is moved towards him, by a certaine de&s;ire in its pondero&s;itie, till that it hath obtained a like re&s;ting place on all parts, &s;upporting and &s;u&s;taining upon it, the other parts of the world, as upon its &s;houlders. This then is the nature of the earth and &s;o likewi&s;e of the Chaos, and the &s;ympathy which it hath with all other creatures, which he &s;ubjecteth to all in the &s;eate, which hee hath appointed to it, which is the Center of the world, and being &s;etled firme round about the Center, re&s;teth and bea|reth up all other things; and &s;eeing it beareth up all other things, and &s;eeing it is mo&s;t imperfect, it &s;eeks help and ble&s;&s;ing from on high, to produce that which it is enjoyned to do. In this point then the Chaos re&s;teth nece&s;&s;arily, becau&s;e the Lord hath appointed this for its place of repo&s;e, &amp; as a bound for the motion of its weight, which bound and limit it cannot nor will not pa&s;&s;e; becau&s;e the Lord hath &s;poken, it mu&s;t be &s;o: and this nature, this Sympathy is given to it from the Lord, as a nece&s;&s;ary &s;u&s;tentation of all the Species, and individuals, for which rea&s;on, <HI>David</HI> &s;aith <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 104.5. <HI>He hath laid the foundation of the Earth upon Ba&s;es, that it &s;hould not be mooved for ever.</HI> And <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 136.6. <HI>O give thankes to him that &s;tretcheth a out the Erth above the Waters.</HI> Now becau&s;e this Chaos is the mother of all Creatures, not only of the inferiour bodies, but al&s;o of the caele&s;tiall, and of all things Created, as we &s;hall heare anon, we ought not to doubt but all the Elements, yea, all the Heavens, up to the very highe&s;t, beare the nature of their mother, &s;ome more, &s;ome le&s;&s;e, and have &s;ome weight for to encline downe|wards,

towards the mid&s;t, and exerci&s;e their Sympathy, as well towards the Earth, as among them&s;elves, by a certaine cheri&s;hing, a gentle touching, and as it were by a feeling. Now experience al&s;o teacheth us that the weightie&s;t things, by nature draw more ea&s;ily, and neere&s;t to the Center of the World, and the &s;eate (I &s;ay) of ponderous things: Whence proceedeth a mo&s;t certaine rea&s;on of order in the uni|ver&s;e, that the things which are lighte&s;t, and &s;ubtile&s;t have the &s;uperiour place, and not onely that, but al&s;o the Shpaericall figure of the Chaos, and of the whole world, take from hence their Sour&s;e, for &s;eeing the nature of the Chaos was floating, and &s;o altogether, and that all &s;ides of equall vertue and facility, was borne by its weight to this re&s;ting place, &s;o that all the extremities were equally di&s;tant from the Center, and &s;ub&s;i&s;ted from every part of the Center with a like weight: for if the di&s;tance hereof had beene unequall from the Center, more weight had laine upon the one &s;ide of the Center, than upon the other.

The Chaos then mu&s;t nece&s;&s;a|rily con&s;i&s;t of an equall weight under the Sphaericall figure, and no figure el&s;e could be &s;o convenient for the world, &s;ince that the &s;upreame and mo&s;t perfect bodies, ought to march about the circumference of the Earth, for the helpe of generation by a perpetuall circumvolution. <HI>Iohn de Sacrobo&s;co</HI> &amp; &s;ome other Mathematicians, approve be&s;t of the Sphaericall figure of the Earth, by &s;ome apparent accidents: but it is much more excellent, to demon&s;trate every thing from the foun|taine it &s;elfe, and out of the cau&s;es (I &s;ay) becau&s;e the &s;ollid &s;cience proceedeth by this way.

<HEAD>CHAP. IV. Of the Fabricke of the World. <HI>Of the nature and forme of the Chaos, or primary matter.</HI></HEAD>
<P><HI>_MO&s;es</HI> &s;heweth mo&s;t clearely; that the light which was Created out of the Chaos in the beginning, was the principle of al things made by God, producing out of the &s;ame all the workes of the &s;ixe dayes: now his fir&s;t propo&s;ition argueth evidently, that there was nothing Created by God before this matter, otherwi&s;e he would not have con&s;tituted therein the beginning of the Creation. Seeing then, that all things are made after this manner, and out of it, to &s;earch as is requi&s;ite the originall of nature, and to con|&s;titute the beginnings, according to the truth of naturall philo&s;ophy. It is nece&s;&s;ary above all things to con&s;ider mo&s;t diligently, what this primary matter was. The hea|then Philo&s;ophers troubled them&s;elves much in the con&s;ideration of this matter, they dur&s;t not deny, but that it was, and yet would in no wi&s;e grant it to be e&s;&s;ence, they &s;aid it was neither quantity, nor quality, and that it had neither of them in it, and &s;o made it naked of all quality and forme, when they te&s;tified it to be as a meere Priva|tion. And &s;ome of them proceeded &s;o farre in their impudency and temerity, as to &s;ay, that God laboured to &s;ubdue this matter, and to make it &s;ubject to formes. What can be &s;aid more fooli&s;hly, or &s;poken more villanou&s;ly again&s;t the omnipotency of God? to wit, as if he, who was able to make and to induce formes el&s;ewhere (much more noble then the matter it &s;elfe, as they would have it) could not al&s;o Create a a matter, which he him&s;elfe might &s;ubject to all the worke? But &s;uch is the ob&s;cu|rity and blindene&s;&s;e of humane under&s;tanding, that without the guidance of the word of God, it cannot, as it ought, comprehend and know any thing certainely, of that which is &s;o farre from &s;en&s;e; and which hath its originall Divine: Likewi&s;e this is a very great folly, to goe about to mea&s;ure and &s;earch out of their &s;hallow braines, the mo&s;t deepe my&s;teries of nature, her primary originall (I &s;ay) and the extreame A|by&s;&s;e of the coun&s;elles and workes of God. Nature her &s;elfe can teach us, that all things were created of a matter, but who dare be &s;o bold, as to obtrude for Oracles, the manner and conditions of that matter, which are no where &s;howne, either by Gods word, or any foote&s;tep of nature, yea which are contrary to the manife&s;t Word of God? they &s;poile the fir&s;t matter of all forme, and of all condition, and kinde of being, in &s;uch &s;ort, that it cannot be &s;aid, what way it can &s;ub&s;i&s;t in it &s;elfe. But <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> calleth it in Expre&s;&s;e words, Earth, Water, and the Deepe, before that the con|create forme, or any new Species was wrought upon it. And in <HI>Eccle&s;ia&s;tes</HI> 3.20, It is called <HI>Aphar,</HI> that is, clay, whence it appeareth, that the &s;ame had from the begin|ning &s;ome kind or forme of Earth and Water, and con&s;equently greatnes and weight. But &s;ome one may object, that Philo&s;ophers to di&s;tingui&s;h betweene things con&s;idered the matter by it &s;elfe, and likewi&s;e the forme by it &s;elfe, to teach more evidently the cau&s;es of things depending on qualities and formes, not on the matter, as al&s;o the generation or production of the kindes, which is wrought by the acce&s;&s;e of the forme to the matter, which is well &s;aid; and we al&s;o our &s;elves affirme the qualities, and formes to be active, and begetters of Species, but not the matter voyd of them. But herein they erre grievou&s;ly in two things, fir&s;t of all in this, that a&s;cending from the la&s;t and mo&s;t perfect forme to the fir&s;t of all, which can be imagined, they &s;eparate them all equally from the matter, and hold them as acce&s;&s;ors, and induced from el&s;e|where, &s;o that at length they leave the matter naked, whereas according to the true production of Species, de&s;cribed by <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> it is not lawfull, to a&s;cend above the de|finition of the Chaos, &s;ignified by <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> for this having beene the fir&s;t beginning of things, in this all things are finally re&s;olved, according to <HI>Eccle&s;ia&s;tes. Chap.</HI> 3. Whe|ther could they amount higher paring that, &s;eeing they cannot proove it to be com|pounded? Secondly, they faile yet more grievou&s;ly in this, when as they make all formes &s;o e&s;tranged from the matter, that they deny it to have in it any &s;eminary ver|tue,

or &s;mall note, but will have it to take its primary beginning el&s;ewhere from without the matter, which we impugne, &s;eeing it is manife&s;t out of the generation of the world, and divine te&s;timonies, that the primary matter hath had its owne forme, quality and quantity, and that out of the forme thereof, the formes of o|ther things did proceed. Moreover, it is mo&s;t ab&s;urd, yea, contrary to the nature of God, to Create &s;omething without forme, and without all vertue and quality, as well by rea&s;on of his purpo&s;e, as by rea&s;on of his Maje&s;ty; and Omnipotency; of his purpo&s;e, becau&s;e &s;eeing he hath appointed all things for the &s;ervice of man, to what purpo&s;e &s;hould an idle mother &s;erve, which neither can doe any thing of her &s;elfe, nor is able to bend the qualities and vertues received, but rather &s;lackens them, for if thou will &s;ay, &s;he conferreth &s;omething to the qualities received, thou affirme&s;t at once things contradictory. The matter not to be neither quantity nor quality, nor yet to comprehend either as her owne in her bowels, and yet neverthele&s;&s;e to be endowed with &s;ome vertue, as &s;he worketh &s;omething. Now in re&s;pect of his omnipotency, and Maje&s;ty it doth in no wi&s;e be&s;eeme God, to create a matter wholly voyd of forme, for &s;eeing that he is a forme forming all formes, a pure light, a pure vertue and effica|cy, a pure life, and a breathing goodne&s;&s;e; how can he produce any thing voyd, and dead, who hath directed his maine &s;cope unto life? He who conceived to Create man after his owne Image, how &s;hould he beginne a &s;luggi&s;h and dead foundation, and forme man of that then of which nothing can be more unlike, yea, more contrary to, and e&s;tranged from God? He who maketh the beginning of &s;uch an excellent, and incomparable worke to be &s;o vild, injureth the Almighty, and doth detract from his Maje&s;ty and Omnipotency. <HI>Empedocles,</HI> and <HI>Anaxagoras</HI> &s;eeme to have had a better and a righter opinion of the primary matter, whom <HI>Plotinus</HI> reprooveth in his Booke <HI>de Materia, Chap.</HI> 7. For <HI>Empedocles</HI> did not &s;o endle&s;ly pare from the matter, nor de|nude it of all qualitie, but when he had learned by experience, that all bodies are re|&s;olved into the Elements, whereof they were compo&s;ed, and did not find any further re&s;olution, he cea&s;eth to &s;earch out any higher the beginning of the matter, as being ignorant of the fir&s;t matter, whereof the Elements were produced. Now whereas <HI>Plotin</HI> objecteth again&s;t him the corruption of the Elements, it hath no place, becau&s;e the Elements are not corrupted, but onely the mixtures, by who&s;e putrifaction and re&s;olution the Elements are repurged and re&s;tored to their integrity. But <HI>Anaxagoras</HI> comming neere&s;t to the nature of the Chaos affirmed a certaine wateri&s;h mixture to be the primary matter, erring indeed in the mixture, but perhaps becau&s;e the right name did not occurre he would de&s;cribe it by a &s;imilitude the neere&s;t to the thing, be|ing taught by a mo&s;t ancient tradition, that the fir&s;t matter of all was <HI>APHAR</HI> and <GAP DESC="foreign">, he added that this &s;ame matter, had not onely a pa&s;&s;ive fitne&s;&s;e to all things, as o|thers would have it, that it might receive formes induced from el&s;ewhere, but that it actually (&s;upply not expre&s;ly nor potentially) contained in it &s;elfe, or in its owne e&s;&s;ence all formes, and all Species, wherein &s;urely he erreth not farre from the truth, as it &s;hall appeare in the progre&s;&s;e, but if we would have the Species to bee formed from the matter, as <HI>Plotin</HI> &s;eemed to &s;ay, certainely therein he erred: for the mo&s;t imperfect cannot produce the mo&s;t perfect, but it &s;elfe hath neede of one to perfect it. Now for to attaine to the true doctrine of the primary matter, omitting the dreames of the Pagans (I &s;ay) briefely, what I thinke ought fir&s;t to be thought of it, and in the pur&s;uite thereof will proove it out of the Word of God, and the con&s;ent of per|ceptible nature with it: &s;uch then is the &s;tate of this matter.</P>
<P>The Omnipotent God, Lord of nature, is able onely to Create what&s;oever he wil|leth, whereof <HI>Iohn</HI> the Bapti&s;t gives te&s;timony in the third Chapter of Saint <HI>Mat|thewes</HI> Go&s;pell, and in the third likewi&s;e of Saint <HI>Luke.</HI> That God is able of tho&s;e &s;tones, to rai&s;e up Children unto <HI>Abraham, ver&s;e</HI> 9. And who without any &s;ubjected matter to worke upon, was able out of nothing to Create this vi&s;ible world, much more could he then al&s;o in a moment, make out of all, all what&s;oever he would. Ne|verthele&s;&s;e he him&s;elfe, hath followed in Creating a manner, and rule, which hee gave to nature as we &s;hall &s;ee anon. Now nature being once ordained, and con&s;ti|tuted by God, doth not all what &s;he willeth, out of all that &s;hee willeth, but &s;he en|gendreth it out of the matter, which is the neere&s;t to that, which nature propo&s;eth, for &s;uch is infinite providence. So &s;he engendreth not out of a &s;tone Corne, but of an

earthly and wateri&s;h moy&s;ture, neither doth &s;he produce fire out of water, but out of oyle, and yet more out of brim&s;tone, A quality then accommodated to things, which are engendred, is required in the matter, and we &s;ee by this univer&s;all law of nature once con&s;tituted by God; that nothing is begot is out of nothing, nor out of a matter affected to the contrary, or improper to generation.</P>
<P>All opperation then of nature, in the matter affected to the contrary and improper, is violent, le&s;&s;e neverthele&s;&s;e in the improper, than in the affected to the contrary. Now that, which &s;uffereth force, the operatour being taken away, it returneth to its naturall cour&s;e, unle&s;&s;e it be vanqui&s;hed by an act of longer durance, and by little and little is drawne into the nature of the operator. All generation then in the matter is violent, if we &s;ay, that it was without all quality, and naturall affection, whereby it may be enclined to engender. Now the generation, and continuation of the &s;pecies, their multiplication and their agreement, and &s;ympathy of things among them&s;elves, is nece&s;&s;ary as it is &s;aid, in the fift Chapter, and as a may &s;ee manife&s;tly, through|out in the Oeconomie of the world: It was requi&s;ite then that the matter out of which &s;omething was to be engendred, &s;hould fir&s;t have &s;ome nature, and condition proper to it &s;elfe, which might be meete to the Species intended,; which ought to be engen|dred out of it.</P>
<P>This &s;ame nature if in &s;ome &s;ort, it had not had a roote in the primary matter, out of the Creation, how could it be enclined to that duty, whereunto God had appointed all things, to wit, to &s;erve for the u&s;e of man? What &s;ympathy could there ever be of things among them&s;elves? which is &s;o nece&s;&s;ary to be knowne and ob&s;erved by us, that the Holy Gho&s;t, which &s;u&s;taineth, and directeth all things created to this u&s;e (the Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul</HI> &s;peaking in the eight Chapter to the <HI>Romanes</HI> de&s;cribeth it amply) when he &s;heweth us, the incomparable greatne&s;&s;e of the glory, which &s;hall be manife&s;ted to us by the &s;ervice of the&s;e Creatures, &s;aying. The earne&s;t expectation of the creature wayteth for the manife&s;tation of the Sonnes of God in glory, that is, it doth the duty, which God hath impo&s;ed upon it cheerefully, &s;u&s;tayning carefully mankind in this life, with a de&s;ire that they might be &s;aved, and be led to God their Creatour&punc; And &s;o this &s;ervice of the Creature &s;aith he is done to many vaine and unprofitable, and neverthe|le&s;&s;e it is not &s;ubject to this vanity of its owne accord, that is, it is not all one, whether it is &s;erviceable to the good, or to the bad, but a&s;much as it is able doth the office which is enjoyned to it, to the glory of God, and the Salvation of man. Neverthe|le&s;&s;e, God hath &s;ubjected it to this vanity, that it might &s;erve al&s;o to the wicked, though in vaine, yet not &s;imply, but by rea&s;on of him, who hath &s;ubjected the &s;ame in hope, if peradventure they might in groping, ta&s;te the benignity and benevolence of God, and be converted. And to &s;hew, that it &s;erveth to the wicked unwillingly; adding that it &s;hall be delivered from the bondage of corruption, into the glorious li|berty of the children of God, after which the whole Creation groaneth, to wit, till Chri&s;t our Lord, and nature having fini&s;hed the la&s;t propagation of mankind, &s;hall bring his faithfull ones into the glory of God his Father: thou &s;ee&s;t heere mo&s;t manife&s;tly, how great the Sympathy of all things is betweene them and man which were impo&s;|&s;ible to be done out of a matter without all forme, or void of any quality or affection. But thou wilt &s;ay out of the Philo&s;ophy of the Pagans, that God hath &s;ince given a forme unto the matter created, out of which thereafter generation and propagation is made. And to what purpo&s;e I pray you, hath he made in the &s;econd place, and by a &s;e|cond operation, that which he might have done at the fir&s;t, and by the fir&s;t Creation? might he not a&s;wel from the beginning, have given the matter properly qualified, in its owne nature, as afterward to have given the quality, and that by force? Againe, can he which is al forme, vertue, a mo&s;t perfect, a mo&s;t mighty, and a mo&s;t good Act, the begin|ning it &s;elf, and the fountaine of good, procreate &s;omething altogether without forme, and mo&s;t alienate from all manner of affection and action? Now the Lord would create man his chiefe worke, after his owne Image, for otherwi&s;e how could hee enjoy the glory of God in di&s;&s;imilitude? Things that are unlike, delight not in things unlike, but abhorre them, it is then requi&s;ite for man to have a great &s;imilitude with God, as he which ought to participate greately of his glory. But the holy Scripture witne&s;&s;eth, that the univer&s;all glory of God &s;hall be manife&s;ted to his Saints, and that we &s;hall be like unto him, becau&s;e we &s;hall &s;ee him as he is, the greate&s;t &s;imilitude then, betweene

man and God, &s;hall be in the life to come, the beginnings of which excellency he hath received in the Creation, as <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> te&s;tifieth in <HI>Gene&s;is,</HI> as he who from the begin|ning of his Creation, &s;hould conver&s;e with God, and &s;erve him in this world in all obedience, untill he were accrued into the &s;imilitude, which God concreated with him, and &s;hould receive his highe&s;t perfection in the Heavens.</P>
<P>Seeing therefore that man is Created after the Image of God, and that al&s;o the o|ther Creatures, for having a true &s;ympathy with Man, to whom they ought to be &s;erviceable; have likewi&s;e obtained &s;ome &s;imilitude with God in the Creation it &s;elfe, e&s;pecially, the primary matter, to wit, the Chaos out of which all things were created; yea man him&s;elfe ought to have &s;ome &s;imilitude with his Creatour, for it had beene ab&s;urd (as I have &s;aid before) that God the fountaine of all goodne&s;&s;e &s;hould have created &s;ome ill thing, and that he, who is all life, and quickning vertue; &s;hould create a &s;tupid body, voyd of all quality or affection, which &s;hould be immediately reformed, to the end it might agree, a&s;well with the Species, which were to be created, as with man. For &s;eeing the worke of every Arti&s;an, &s;heweth the indu&s;try, wi&s;edome, and the &s;tudy of his Spirit, how much more then the workes of God, re|pre&s;ent as well his intention, as in &s;ome &s;ort his Image. He then, who from the be|ginning hath thus formed and ordained nature, that &s;hee might bring forth a ge|neration, no otherwi&s;e then from a matter properly qualified, hath al&s;o created and produced the fir&s;t Species of things, out of a Chaos convenient thereunto.</P>
<P>We conclude then, that the Chaos was the fir&s;t of all things, having in its e&s;&s;ence, the &s;eede of all qualities and formes, a nature (I &s;ay) &s;imple, and not compounded, deducible and di&s;tributive into &s;o many qualities and &s;pecies, as there is now in univer|&s;all nature. Al&s;o that it was like to its Creatour in this, that as God the Father is the beginning of all Deity, having all things covertly in him&s;elfe, which are expre&s;&s;ed actually in the<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">The Father worketh of him&s;elfe by the Son and the holy Gho&s;t, the Word his Sonne from the Father by the holy Gho&s;t, and the holy Gho&s;t from the Father and the Son.</NOTE> Word, his Sonne, and &s;hed abroad by the Holy Gho&s;t, and com|municated with the Creatures, that &s;o al&s;o the Chaos comprehended all the formes of things, &s;ub&s;tances and qualities, &s;ecretly within her bowels, and intrin&s;icke e&s;&s;ence, according to the Seminary and Radicall power, which being by the Creator extracted out of it, perfected and di&s;tributed into &s;everall Species, &s;erved man by an act of e|gredient. And as in God the Father, the multitude of Idea's, not as many, but com|pri&s;ed under one &s;imple unity, is brought forth from God by the Creation into every Species, &s;o the Chaos being a nature &s;imple, and not compo&s;ed, is produced, and made perfect by the Creation in &s;o many &s;ub&s;tances and kindes, as is requi&s;ite for the body, and Oeconomie of the world. And like as the &s;ub&s;tance of God is not com|pounded, neither con&s;i&s;ting of matter or forme, but an indivi&s;ible e&s;&s;ence, yea in thought, &s;o al&s;o the &s;ub&s;tance of the primary matter, or Chaos, is not compounded, nor con&s;i&s;ting of matter and forme, introduced from el&s;ewhere, or a new Created in it, but in a &s;imple e&s;&s;ence, Created from one act by a &s;imple being God and a vitall &s;ub&s;tance and life, or a &s;ub&s;tantiall forme, or e&s;&s;entiall &s;ub&s;tance, or in any &s;uch &s;ort, that the vnity of the matter and forme may be expre&s;&s;ed exi&s;ting: in this neverthele&s;&s;e, before other differences the mo&s;t di&s;tant from God, that it is corporeall, and gro&s;&s;e, actually finite in vertue and power, being onely a &s;mall beginning of the&s;e things, and divi&s;ible into different &s;ub&s;tances, yea even to contraries, not immediately, but by the degrees of generation, which are betwixt both. The ancient Philo&s;ophers have not given a &s;ound divi&s;ion of the Primary matter, in having made two beginnings of things diver&s;e, and not communicating, to wit, the matter, and forme. In things which are engendred, &s;uch a di&s;tinction brings with it &s;ome light to the under&s;tanding, when as we contemplate the matter out of which &s;omething is made, and the forme which it ought to be, introduced: and which as yet doth not exi&s;t in the &s;everall parts, accor|ding as the cau&s;e of the thing requireth, but when as we make this in the fir&s;t matter, and out of the cau&s;e of generation, we conceive a matter wholly without forme and voyd, and we wander a&s;tray from the true naturall beginnings.</P>
<P>The Chaos is then in things which are created out of God, e&s;&s;ence of e&s;&s;ences, forme of formes, &s;ub&s;tance of &s;ub&s;tances, not by act, but by power, and that not forraigne, but interiour, making the matter and the beginning of the forme, as a mother to all things. But fir&s;t of all, God is the Worker, then the vertue &s;pecificall: ordained by God, in forming them, perfecting and preparing for the birth. Wee &s;hall &s;ee then

<HEAD>CHAP. V. Of the Fabricke of the World. <HI>Touching the fal&s;e and true under&s;tanding of the Idea's.</HI></HEAD>
<P>_BVT fora&s;much as through the &s;ini&s;ter under&s;tanding and con&s;iderations of Idea's and formes, many ab&s;urd things are taught by the Philo&s;ophers, que&s;tions, and intricate di&s;putes are moved, and the true order of the ope|rations in nature is ob&s;cured, it behooveth us to &s;earch out more deepely the condition and nature of the Idea's and fermes, that not relying upon a fal&s;e foundation, we doe not deceive our &s;elves, and in&s;tead of true &s;cience, con&s;ti|tute &s;o many vaine opinions as fooli&s;h dotages. When the Philo&s;ophers would that the formes &s;hould be brought el&s;ewhere into the matter, they a&s;&s;igne unto them an|other beginning, and &s;eparated from the matter, to wit, a certaine eternall Idea, out of which they flow, and are joyned to the matter, &s;o that every e&s;&s;ence is not &s;imple, but one compounded of divers things, and &s;eparated, and incommunicable of matter and forme, and therefore the matter and forme had not any &s;imilitude in the e&s;&s;ence, nor any Sympathy betweene them, before the compo&s;ition. It is well knowne and u|&s;uall, that every good workeman, before he beginne his worke, conceiveth a certaine Idea thereof, by the contemplation of which, he beginneth and accompli&s;heth it, but are many things oftentimes, which pre&s;ent them&s;elves ever and be&s;ide the modell con|ceived, he addeth or taketh from it, and if diver&s;e men &s;hall undertake the &s;ame worke in Species, there will be as many differences, as workema&s;ters. There is not then any Idea out of man, which conceiveth and frameth &s;uch a modell in his under|&s;tanding, but he him&s;elfe by the clearene&s;&s;e of his under&s;tanding, and according to the knowledge which he hath of things, which are required, be it true, be it fal&s;e, and according to the judgement of his rea&s;on, he imagineth and frameth the accident by experience, or el&s;ewhere he amendeth it, after upon better knowledge. So God as by him&s;elfe, being the mo&s;t wi&s;e, mo&s;t mighty, and the mo&s;t skillfull Architect of the world, hath created all things no otherwi&s;e, than by a mo&s;t good and exqui&s;ite rea|&s;on. It is nece&s;&s;ary therefore, that he of him&s;elfe from all eternity had conceived an Idea mo&s;t requi&s;ite for his worke; for it is not the property of a wi&s;e man, to make a|ny thing without good order, manner and rea&s;on, for the things which are &s;o made, are either made ca&s;ually or ra&s;hly, and cannot promi&s;e a certaine good i&s;&s;ue. But he tooke not this Idea, for the framing of his worke, out of a fore knowledge of things with a foreknowne rationation, and meditation as from a certaine modell after the manner of men, &s;eeing he of him&s;elfe, and without any motion of under&s;tanding, al|teration, in&s;pection, and au&s;cultation, is all wi&s;e, Almighty, having in the vertue of his e&s;&s;ence repre&s;ented before his view, and pondered all the beginnings of things, the meanes, ends, manners, conditions, number, proportions, habitudes, and all what|&s;oever &s;hould appeare vi&s;ible, a workema&s;ter (I &s;ay) &s;o perfect from the mo&s;t inter|nall Center, and fountaine of his e&s;&s;ence, hath this increated Idea, &s;hining forth in all things, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed it eternally; and this Idea is one, and &s;imple, as the e&s;&s;ence of God is one and &s;imple, but proceeding by fruitfulne&s;&s;e, as from the generation and propagation into branches and all formes and Species, according to the intention and &s;cope of the Creation in the alone &s;pecies of man. Therefore when&s;oever thou art de&s;irous, to contemplate inwardly, the creation of things, and art willing to &s;earch out well their affinity and Sympathy, it is requi&s;ite for thee to contemplate the &s;ame, with all the &s;ubtilty, and force of thy under&s;tanding, by what order every thing is created, and whereof, and in what manner the one &s;pecies exceedeth the other, for from thence the Creatures are knowne, and the order of &s;ubjection of every one of them, as farre, as may concerne man. It is now in no wi&s;e lawfull to place this Idea
<PB N="17" REF="20">
out of the &s;ub&s;tance and e&s;&s;ence of God, for it is mo&s;t properly proper to God him|&s;elfe, and communicable to no other but to God onely, as his e&s;&s;ence agreeth to no o|ther, then to God: neverthele&s;&s;e we de&s;ire with &s;ome, to make fooles of our &s;elves, who have dreamed that all things have beene ingendred out of the e&s;&s;ence of God, and are as parcels of him, and for this cau&s;e that the Soules of all returne againe unto him. Seeing therefore that this Idea, is in&s;eparable from the e&s;&s;ence of God, it is not law|full for any man to thinke of any primary beginning of formes and &s;pecies but in God. Now if any one &s;hould place the Idea's out of God, they &s;hould not be the primary, but &s;ecundary Idea's, created of the primary which is in God, the which when they are placed by the Philo&s;ophers out of things, and are &s;aid to enter into the matter, and to con&s;titute things them&s;elves, and the &s;pecies compounded, what is that el&s;e, but to adde a helpe to the Creatour, which formeth all things, &s;ufficient for all things? as if he him&s;elfe had not beene able to doe that immediately, or at lea&s;t, that he vouch&s;afed not, who is enflamed with &s;uch a great love to his worke, and that hee delighteth to be with the Sonnes of men. And if we grant him, who is all vertue, and a pregnant efficacy, and Almighty for mo&s;t noble effects, to have created a matter without forme, idle and wholly imperfect, and of no quality of it &s;elfe, why &s;hould we &s;ay it is created of formes, more worthy and noble than the matter, by &s;trange and mini&s;tred Idea's? were not that to dimini&s;h the glory of the Creatour? or wilt thou that the matter be created by &s;econdary Idea's? What Idea I pray can be fained from that which is nothing, and bereft of all e&s;&s;ence? For (they for&s;ooth) would have the Ideas to be effectives of formes. Now if any man &s;hould affirme the&s;e Idea's to be made, not onely in re&s;pect of the fir&s;t Creatour of things, but for the perpetuall propagation of the Species, what difference then would there be, betweene the propagation, and the primary con&s;titution of the thing? The Species, &s;hould it not be wholy compounded, the forme being induced into the matter? So then, God hath created the fir&s;t man, and the &s;ame worke of the Creation is con&s;equently renewed in every man; how is it &s;aid, that the Lord re&s;ted the &s;eaventh day, and afterwards to create? <HI>Gen.</HI> 2. <HI>ver&s;e</HI> 2. As tho&s;e who have beene ca&s;t out of the a&s;&s;embly of the faithfull, for Heretickes, who did affirme that the Angels were worldly Creatures, no le&s;&s;e &s;hould &s;uch bee, who affirme the Idea's are placed out of God, to con&s;titute the Species of things. For &s;uch Idea's are al&s;o Creatures, no le&s;&s;e than the Angels: to this may bee added that which I have &s;aid before, that if thou do&s;t con&s;titute the Species, and the matter &s;epa|rated, and incommunicating (as it is nece&s;&s;ary when thou make&s;t the matter to bee wholly without forme, and that the &s;ame joyned with the forme, yeeldeth a com|pound not &s;imple) it cannot be, that there is any inclination of the matter to the forme or appetite, or any Sympathy what&s;oever, ri&s;ing out of the different &s;imilitude. Many frivilous que&s;tions, and altogether, unprofitable, are &s;prunge out of the&s;e Idea's &s;epa|rated from God, and from things, the which in what manner &s;oever thou re&s;olve&s;t them, yet &s;halt thou never attaine unto the truth of the Creation, and Generation, and therefore can&s;t not affirme any thing certaine, neither of the beginning of nature, nor of the end and Sympathy.</P>
<P>We &s;ay then, that there is an univer&s;all Idea, re&s;iding e&s;&s;entially in God, which is the totall rea&s;on of all the things, which God was willing to Create, di&s;po&s;ed and de|&s;tinated, according to his infinite wi&s;edome and will, and that this Idea is expre&s;&s;ed by an eternall act, e&s;pecially in the framing of the world, and that the &s;pecies are mul|tiplied and increa&s;ed, into many individuals, without any Idea, co-operating out of God; in this act of every &s;pecies, there is imprinted the character of the Idea of this &s;pecies, exi&s;ting in God, out of which impre&s;&s;ion, it is afterward enclined to the pro|pagation of its &s;pecies. We call al&s;o this Idea, or rea&s;on of all things, to wit, an in|ternall act from the e&s;&s;ence of God, to have proportion to the &s;ame e&s;&s;ence: there|fore the Creatures which are Images of the &s;ame Idea, are &s;aid to have &s;ome Analo|gie to the Sub&s;tance and e&s;&s;ence of God.

<HEAD>CHAP. VI. Of the Fabricke of the World. <HI>Of the time of the beginning of the Creation.</HI> The fir&s;t Day.</HEAD>
<P>_WHen as the Lord beganne to Create the Starres, and their motion was not yet in being, and con&s;equently, as yet there was no time, according to the Philo&s;ophers definition; neverthele&s;&s;e in this darke&s;ome &s;pace, which proceeded or went before the light, is accounted for a part of this day, and is called night and evening: <HI>Gen.</HI> 1.5. and con&s;tituted with the light following, unto its &s;etting, a naturall day, equall to them that followed. This eternall &s;pace then is mea&s;ured by God, by the fir&s;t, and la&s;t, according to the greatne&s;&s;e of the parts, and there is no difference, with the time of the Phy&s;itians, &s;aving that it cannot be mea&s;ured, but by the compari&s;on of mea&s;ure, borrowed out of the Creation; for this eternity going before the world, had neither as yet yeares, moneths, or dayes, or any &s;uch like accident whereby it might be mea&s;ured. And if the time of the Phy&s;itians cannot be mea&s;ured, &s;hall it therefore cea&s;e to be time? for the mea&s;uring of a time is an accident belonging to time, it cannot be defined. What|&s;oever is knowne to be, hath its definition in the nature of it, though it cannot be ex|pre&s;&s;ed by words. So eternity is truely knowne to be, becau&s;e common under&s;tanding &s;heweth it: con&s;idering, there is not any man confe&s;&s;eth that to be, which never was, and that which is, &s;ometimes not to be, and therefore that which is, there is no doubt, but that &s;ometime, or in &s;ome time it was, and this is a common opinion, that that which was in no time, and which is no part, that that is not at al. For it is impo&s;&s;ible to conceive the e&s;&s;ence of any thing, without the circum&s;tance of time and place. There|fore for the &s;hunning of ambitious and captious tearmes, and many vaine imaginati|ons, drawne from the definition of time and place, although at this day in u&s;e, and whereby deceiveable Sophi&s;ters ob&s;cure the under&s;tanding, as it were with a thicke mi&s;t, it is better to apply the &s;pirit to the &s;ub&s;tances them&s;elves of time and place, or if thou wilt may rather be called e&s;&s;ence, and if ye cannot expre&s;&s;e their rea&s;ons, be|cau&s;e expre&s;&s;e words are wanting, neverthele&s;&s;e to contemplate them, after &s;ome con|ceived &s;imile. So thou mai&s;t imagine time to be a certaine extention of durance, be|tweene the fir&s;t, and the la&s;t, which after the Creation of the World, is exqui&s;itely mea&s;ured, by the con&s;tant and immoveable motions of the &s;tarres, and though there were no &s;uch mea&s;urings before the Creation of the World, yet it cea&s;ed not to have time in it, and if any &s;peculation requireth the mea&s;uring, we will apply by this our thought the mea&s;ures of this our time, touching the exten&s;ion to the eternall parts thereof. As we would in &s;ome &s;ort declare the eternity of God, we may &s;ay it was a thou&s;and Ages (I &s;peake of &s;o great an exten&s;ion) before the Creation of the World, and be&s;ides them, a thou&s;and more al&s;o, and a thou&s;and be&s;ides, and &s;o foreward with|ous end. And &s;o a common under&s;tanding may in &s;ome &s;ort mea&s;ure the parts of eter|nity, and what neede have we here of any &s;ubtile Tergiver&s;ations, and Labyrinths?
<PB N="19" REF="21">
Things which are eternall and uncreated, are ea&s;ily conceived by &s;ome &s;uch like con|ception, when they are not defined or well de&s;cribed. And the Word of God a&s;cri|beth often to him, eternall and infinite ages, from the fir&s;t, to the la&s;t, accommoda|ting it to the common capacity, which he likewi&s;e hath formed. Wee may al&s;o &s;uppo&s;e the place to be a certaine &s;pace, wherein the thing is, which we will divide into three &s;pecies, into that which exceedeth the comprehen&s;ion, into the equall, and into the le&s;&s;er, not determining of any thing touching the greatne&s;&s;e of the compre|hen&s;ion. According to the fir&s;t, man is in a hou&s;e; for the &s;econd, every body is in the water, or aire, comprehending on all &s;ides the extremities: according to the third, every thing, and God principally is al&s;o in the very lea&s;t place: the Creature accor|ding to the figure <HI>Synecdoche,</HI> but God according to his whole e&s;&s;ence. If any one, the&s;e things being thus determined, &s;hould doubt that &s;omething was ordained eter|nally be&s;ides God, he mu&s;t con&s;ider, that time and place are brought in God, yea from his e&s;&s;ence, con&s;idering that e&s;&s;ence cannot be without time and place. For God (as <HI>Iohn Dama&s;cene</HI> &s;peaketh excellently. <HI>lib.</HI> 1. <HI>cap.</HI> 10.) is place of him&s;elfe. In the like manner, and by the &s;ame rea&s;on may one imagine, that he is al&s;o time him|&s;elfe. And <HI>Tertullian</HI> again&s;t <HI>P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">axea</HI> writeth thus: God, before all things were Created, was alone him&s;elfe to him&s;elfe, and the World, and place and all, Page 675, if he &s;earcheth any other &s;ub&s;tance of time and place, hee will be &s;wallowed up into a bottomele&s;&s;e pit in&s;crutable, and goe a&s;tray into ob&s;cure &s;peeches, becau&s;e the depth of God &s;urmounteth exceedingly all under&s;tanding.</P>

<P>Let us &s;ay then with <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> ver&s;e the fifth, that the beginning of the Creation, and fir&s;t naturall day, was made by night, and that the night is the fir&s;t part of the day, and that we ought to beginne the time of the world, from the fir&s;t motion of the Creation, and that God therefore hath not onely ordained a weeke of dayes, as a memoriall of the Creation, but hee would al&s;o have us, that wee &s;hould take like|wi&s;e the beginning of every day, from the &s;etting of the Sunne, and from the even|ing, and that tho&s;e judge ami&s;&s;e, who would have that the ancient Hebrewes did beginne the day, from the ri&s;ing of the Sunne, per&s;wading them thereunto by &s;ome pa&s;&s;ages of the holy Scripture, mi&s;under&s;tood and perverted in <HI>Exodus, chap.</HI> 12.18. The &s;olemnity of the pa&s;&s;eover is commanded to be celebrated for &s;eaven dayes, the beginning, and the end whereof is appointed in the evening. And the Lord ordai|ned the fir&s;t and the la&s;t day &s;olemne <HI>ver.</HI> 16. So that the fir&s;t of <HI>Iohn,</HI> the 19. <HI>ver.</HI> 31, it is called the High Sabbath, and the Hebrewes call <HI>Para&s;ceve,</HI> that is, the pre|paration, the fourteenth day of the moneth, in which the Lambe was &s;acrificed, betweene two Evenings, and di&s;tingui&s;hed from the Pa&s;&s;eover immediately follow|ing, as appeareth. <HI>Matthew</HI> 27.62. <HI>Marke</HI> 15.42. <HI>Luke</HI> 23.54. <HI>Iohn</HI> 19.31. The&s;e are then, two dayes, and two evenings following one another. The fir&s;t is the end of the fourth day, the other after Sunne &s;etting, of the night following, which ap|pertaineth to the day following. Betweene the&s;e two evenings, he commandeth in the &s;ixth ver&s;e, that the Lambe &s;hould be prepared and &s;laine, but that could not be done in a moment, dividing the one, and the other day; therefore the evening is taken more largely, for the ve&s;pertine time, and enclining to the end of the day, or next ending the day, and following incontinently. So <HI>ver.</HI> the eighteenth, when he commandeth them to eate the unleavened bread, upon the fourteenth day from the evening, he meaneth from the evening ending immediately, the day being &s;hut up. For &s;eeing that the &s;etting of the Sunne, di&s;tingui&s;heth the dayes, as the night in which the pa&s;chall Lambe was eaten, and the part of the day before the Sunne-&s;etting, in which they &s;lew the Lambe, may be referred to a day?

<HEAD>CHAP. VII. Of the Fabricke of the World. <HI>The Workes of the Fir&s;t Day.</HI></HEAD>
<P>_THe fir&s;t thing which God created, was this Chaos, whereof hitherto we have di&s;cour&s;ed, to wit, this huge undige&s;ted ma&s;&s;e, the matter and mother of all things that were to be created, which hee calleth Earth, becau&s;e it approacheth neare&s;t to the nature and condition ter|re&s;triall, for the earth was fir&s;t fini&s;hed, and brought forth her fruits, and incontinently after, the Chaos being not yet divided, he calleth it waters, not becau&s;e that then the waters were &s;eparated from the earth, but he &s;hew|eth, that as &s;oone as the water was created, the di&s;tinction of the Elements was be|gun, and therefore before he nameth it Water, hee nameth it Abi&s;&s;e, as &s;ome meane thing betweene a ma&s;&s;e without forme, and the fir&s;t di&s;tinction beginning to appeare, or rather he gives us to under&s;tand, the nature of this ma&s;&s;e, that it was <HI>Aphar,</HI> a flee|ting matter, inclining to the generation of Waters, which he purpo&s;ed fir&s;t to &s;eparate from the Earth. Now all this ma&s;&s;e, how great &s;oever it was, was an Abi&s;&s;e, becau&s;e that yet it was uniforme, not formed into any &s;pecies. The living creatures were not yet, the plants, the bright heaven, yea the Elements them&s;elves, the Earth, the Fire, Water, and Aire (but there was &s;aith <HI>Mo&s;es</HI>) &s;olitude, vacuitie, or &s;olitary unpro|fitable, and void, according as we doe call the Earth uninhabited, barren, and produ|cing nothing for the u&s;e of man, De&s;ert. So, this ma&s;&s;e was a pure &s;olitude, having neverthele&s;&s;e in it the &s;peices, from whence all things which are now might be dedu|ced and formed, which &s;peices is &s;pecially under&s;tood, under the farme of <HI>Aphar,</HI> of clay, and Abi&s;&s;e.</P>
<P>He addeth that this Chaos had not yet, that which was nece&s;&s;arie for the con&s;titution of nature, generative and procreative of all things, to wit, the life. Two things ought principally to be ob&s;erved in the creation: Fir&s;t of it all, that it proceede, by the order of things mo&s;t imperfect, and mo&s;t ignoble, to the mo&s;t perfect and mo&s;t noble, as fir&s;t of all from the Chaos, to the Earth, then to the water, from thence to the heavens, and &s;o con&s;equently. Secondly, that it in&s;titute the nature of all things, their power, acti|ons, order, the manner of doing, the beginnings and the end, and the periods of either of them, and the univer&s;all law of nature, &s;uch in the creation, which hee would have to be perpetually. Willing then, that the inferior world, to wit, the Earth, the Wa|ter, and the Ayre, was the mother of all things, which ought to be engendred, and that the &s;uperiour, was the father endowed with ma&s;culine vertue, that is willing to ordain a &s;eminarie rea&s;on in the Elements, but the prepatartixe, and excitratix to engender power in the heavens, pre&s;ently after that hee be began to extract the Elements, he extracted withall the matter of the heavens, to the end, that the father, and the mo|ther might grow up together, that the power, and all the vertue of the one and the o|ther, might receive engendring, his lawes and rules in the &s;ame creation. And there|fore from the beginning of the di&s;tribution of the Chaos, hee ordained two orders of creatures, and proceedeth by little and little in the one and in the other, to the mo&s;t perfect, and mo&s;t noble, and then when hee began to di&s;tingui&s;h the ma&s;&s;e into Ele|ments, he produceth with the Aire, a Cele&s;tiall and lucent matter, of which afterward the Firmament and the Starres were to be formed and collected, and as in perfecting his worke, he divided to every one his &s;peices apart: &s;o al&s;o hee gave to all of them the proper lawes of nature, to the Elements Elementary, and to the Coele&s;tiall, matter Coele&s;tiall. It is to be under&s;tood neverthele&s;&s;e, that as well the Elements, of the Aire, as the heaven it &s;elfe, wherein the Stars are, have beene noted afterward in the &s;acred Scriptures, under one and the &s;ame name, as for that then which concerneth the name, which was ordained to them by God, the&s;e two were in the beginning of the one,

and the &s;ame condition, and were created together, without di&s;tinction, but pre&s;ently began to be &s;eparated, to wit, when it was requi&s;ite to forme the Firmament, and the Starres of the noble&s;t part of it.</P>
<P>Ob&s;erve now, what the matter of the Coele&s;tiall &s;ub&s;tance was. The Element of Water, began now to appeare, and be gathered together in the arch of the Chaos, ere there was there light, which was nece&s;&s;ary to the operations of nature. And behold (&s;aith he) the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the Waters, he &s;tirred up a vehe|ment wind out of the Chaos, to move the Waters, not yet &s;eparated from the Earth, and to make them mount up into higher waves, that by this agitation, the Water might begin by little and little to &s;eparate it &s;elfe from the mo&s;t gro&s;&s;e &s;ub&s;tance of the Earth, and the mo&s;t &s;ubtile&s;t being &s;tirred out of this wateri&s;h part of the Chaos, was made Aire, and the more part of the Aeth eriall Aire, or Coele&s;tiall &s;ub&s;tances. This bla&s;t made of the&s;e three things, the fir&s;t day, which without all doubt, made the agi|tation to endure longer, and it became more forcible, and vehement, a greater abon|dance of this windie &s;pirit being &s;tirred up, till &s;uch time, that at la&s;t, the Earth be|gan to &s;u&s;taine it &s;elfe, and to gather it &s;elfe more together, it allayed by little and little this agitation, and this windie agitation being &s;omewhat exhau&s;t and con&s;umed, it be|gan, by degrees to re&s;t. When then thou beholde&s;t the heaven to be extracted, and for|med of Water, not yet &s;eparated, thou mai&s;t ea&s;ily from thence under&s;tand, that it hath &s;ome affinitie with the Earth, much more with the Water, from whence the Hebrewes call it <HI>Shamaim,</HI> from the word <HI>ESH,</HI> which &s;ignifieth Waters, becau&s;e it is made of waters, and carrieth the Starres about it, as enflamed waters, according to that which <HI>Egibine</HI> writeth, touching the Etymologie of the nowne. But &s;eeing that the Chaos had heavine&s;&s;e, as well as greatne&s;&s;e, and what&s;oever hath beene made thereof, re&s;embleth in &s;omewi&s;e the nature of a mother, the heavier, and the more ignoble, &s;etled together in one, but the lighter and more noble &s;ub&s;tance, which as it were the fatne&s;&s;e of all the Chaos, being carried upward, was a long time coupled with the &s;uperiour, whence it came to pa&s;&s;e that the heaven was created of the more noble part of the one, and of the other Elements, before they were &s;eparated every one into his place, hence it is the heavens excell in beautie, noblene&s;&s;e, and vertue; all the other Elements, as having beene created of the more noble &s;ub&s;tance of the Chaos, yea likewi&s;e in the heaven, the higher things are more excellent than the inferiour: Moreover, the Coele&s;tials have a perpetuall &s;impathy, affinity, with the Elements, by which they are mutually enclined, the one to the other, likewi&s;e al&s;o the higher things of the Heaven to the lower of them, in &s;uch &s;ort, that there is nothing in the world, which by the &s;impathie given to it, &s;erveth not in &s;ome &s;tead, and order for the u&s;e of man; &s;o the Heavens and the Starres, by rea&s;on of the inclination, which they have to inferiour things, their forme being round, and re&s;ting upon the center of the univer&s;e, make their motion circular and divers, that they might communicate their vertues to inferiour things, as much as is nece&s;&s;ary for generation. Now this Heaven was yet in the fir&s;t day, of one and the &s;ame nature and condition with the other things, and without any difference, and therefore had onely one &s;ole motion, which di&s;tingui&s;hed the day and the night.</P>
<P>But as the workman&s;hip of the creation continued, the mo&s;t lucent matter of the hea|ven began to be gathered apart, into divers Spheres, and Globes of Starres, and Planets, and as every thing began to grow to perfection, and to have its owne proper nature and motion, &s;o al&s;o every one of them, obtained their owne &s;ympathie, and operation. So the light, or mo&s;t re&s;plendent matter, ordained for the Sun, began immediately to ga|ther it &s;elfe, into the demy part of heaven, and to enter within the Globe of the Sunne; &s;o that about tenne houres after the creation (for it began to come into the &s;igne <HI>Leo,</HI> as hath beene demon&s;trated probably in the Chronologie) it gave light to the world, and foureteene houres after, by the daily motion of the heavens it &s;et. This light in the beginning, was al&s;o more feeble, and weake, becau&s;e the matter of the Sunne was as yet di&s;per&s;ed, untill that in the fourth day it was &s;hut up and gathered togethered into its greatne&s;&s;e. This &s;peculation of the gathering together of the Starres into the Globes, and encrea&s;ing of the light cannot be in vaine, con&s;idering it was needefull, that there &s;hould be light the fir&s;t day, which made the day, &s;eeing the Sunne was not perfected, till the fourth day: con&s;idering al&s;o that God had not ordained any other light to make

the day, but the Sunn&euml;; likewi&s;e we mu&s;t not thinke, that the Firmament of heaven, the col<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ection of the Waters, into the matter, the drine&s;&s;e of the Earth, the producti|on of hearbs, fruites, and trees, and all things which God commanded to &s;ole nature, having beene made in a moment, as the commandement &s;eemeth to impart, but by degrees and in the &s;ame order and manner which hee afterward willed that nature &s;hould u&s;e, and therefore, that all, and every worke began then to be, when the mat|ter proper to its nature, was prepared, but principally, on that day in which the com|mandement was given. So then, the &s;eparation of the waters, began the fir&s;t day, and was fini&s;hed on the third. For if all things had beene created in a moment, God &s;hould have &s;eemed rather to have intended to produce things, then to ordaine the lawes and natures of them. The contrarie whereof we &s;hall &s;ee in the third day. It being &s;o then, that every thing ought to be made, with its proper nature, and naturall law, immedi|ately when every thing began to be created, the efficatious vertue thereof began with|all, the meane and rule of working, whereby it ought to &s;erve God in his creation; &s;o that all things in their beginning have had in their creation, as their fore-exerci&s;es, and by nature once ordained, have &s;erved their Creator in the di&s;po&s;ition of others. So having made the weight in the Chaos, and the Center and &s;eate of all things be|ing &s;etled, the di&s;po&s;ition and order of things have followed naturally: So the ma&s;&s;e being moved by the winde, made naturally the &s;eparation of the Earth, and of the Water, and the exhalations a&s;cended upward. The things which were formed of a Coele&s;tiall condition by their Creatour, have al&s;o exerci&s;ed a Coele&s;tiall operation in the generation of hearbes, trees, and living creatures: &s;o the creation went forward, the naturall operation followed it, and the&s;e two afterwards concurred in the other workes of God. Seeing then that this is the order of things, wi&s;ely ordained, and brought to the &s;cope of the whole intention of the Creatour; the lover of true Philo|&s;ophie, may diligently ob&s;erve the order, whereby all things have beene created, what nature of matter, the Creatour gave fir&s;t of all to them, and what he added to their na|ture, how farre the &s;peices is extended in forming the things: Moreover to know if the things environing this creation, did give any helpe thereunto, this is not to be de|&s;piced, for by how much the more we con&s;ider things that are more high, &s;o much the more we &s;hall attaine unto the knowledge of the things created, the efficacie and the communion thereof with other creatures, and con&s;equently its &s;ympathie, and all its operation. Now to the end that the matter of every thing, may be knowne, wee mu&s;t begin with the fir&s;t matter which is the Chaos, for as much thereof as may be knowne, according to the forme and qualitie thereof, &s;o much the better al&s;o may be knowne the things which are fir&s;t created of it, and as of them &s;o of all others. As for the re&s;t, what matters are added by the Creatour for the e&s;tabli&s;hing of the &s;peices, and the na|ture of the thing, this primary nature created cannot teach it, but it mu&s;t be &s;ought out by the latter, as by the apparent greatne&s;&s;e of the thing, the weight, lightne&s;&s;e, firme|ne&s;&s;e, rarietie, fleeting figure qualitie, colours, office, and &s;uch like accidents, and pro|prieties. The cau&s;es efficient whereof neverthele&s;&s;e, are knowne by long &s;tudy and experience. I give chiefely of the&s;e things, becau&s;e they are the fir&s;t foundations (whereunto a Philo&s;opher ought above all to bend his &s;tudies,) to finde out the cau|&s;es and Oeconomy of things. Let every man doe as he plea&s;eth, but for our part, wee will follow the parts of the world, its &s;eate, its proportion, and locall motion, and other things appertaining to Geography, the re&s;t we will leave to the co~templation of &s;pirits more divine: When <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> &s;aith, God &s;aid, he doth not &s;hew a &s;entence given for &s;ome peculiar time, but the perpetuall will of him which &s;peaketh and effecteth the things without words or expre&s;&s;e &s;peech, and produceth them in time definite. So al&s;o in the actions of God, when he &s;aith, God divided the light from the darkene&s;&s;e, hee inten|deth not an externall action, but the perpetuall will of God, whereby alone he begin|neth and perfecteth all things preordained in time. Now I will not &s;ay that in this day; this divi&s;ion was compleate, after which the fourth day, the Sun and all the Stars were finally perfected, but he giveth the wi&s;e not ob&s;curely to under&s;tand this colle|ction of light, whereof I have &s;poken, and that the &s;ame proceeded thus farre this day, that the light gathered together in one part of the heaven, might have power to &s;et, leaving behind it the night, and darkene&s;&s;e. After the workes of this day ended, hee addeth this light to have beene approved, and te&s;tified by God for good, which he did
<PB N="23" REF="23">
not of all Creatures, but of the&s;e onely, which above all others bringeth to man an excellent benefit, and illu&s;trateth, and recommendeth excellently, the worke, and the intention of God. So in things following he extolleth with the &s;ame prai&s;e the dryne&s;&s;e of the Earth, the generations of Hearbes, Trees, and Fruites, the offices of the Sunne, Moone, and the Starres, the wateri&s;h living Creatures, after al&s;o the terre&s;trials. All which thinges, man being finally created, he approoved them to be very good, as tho&s;e which were mo&s;t convenient for his &s;ervice, for who&s;e &s;ake they were created.

<P>_AFter the couching of the light, followed the &s;econd day, wherein the firmament was Created. But he addeth not out of what matter, God would it &s;hould be made: but this is manife&s;t by the Creation of the light. For &s;eeing the light was produced out of the waters, &s;uch as we have &s;aid, and all light commeth from the firmament, it is certaine that that lucent &s;ub&s;tance which brought forth the day, and obtained the circular motion, was made this day into the firmament. Whence the firmament in the holy tongue is called <HI>Shamaim,</HI> becau&s;e it is of the &s;ame &s;ub&s;tance with the light; to wit, wateri&s;h, though a little more ignoble. For the light, as being the more no|ble, required al&s;o the more noble part of the &s;ame &s;ub&s;tance, wherefore the &s;pecies, and nature thereof, was al&s;o later perfected; to wit, the fourth day. This firmament <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> calleth <HI>RAKIA,</HI> by which word diffu&s;ion, exten&s;ion, expan&s;ion, and di&s;ten&s;i|on, are &s;ignified. The rea&s;on therefore of this name is taken out of the worke of the Creation, which was made in this order, and &s;ucce&s;&s;e. By and by &s;o &s;oone as the wind fell to blow upon the deepe, it exhaled upward, and the ayrie and cele&s;tiall &s;ub|&s;tance was diffu&s;ed, wherein what&s;oever was proper to light (dige&s;ted into a lumi|nous e&s;&s;ence) &s;traight begunne to be gathered together, to make up the day: as al&s;o the &s;ub&s;tance of the future firmament, wherein the light was gathered together, and permanent, elevated on high from the element of the ayre; diffu&s;ed, extended, and di&s;played, as a &s;aile or tent about the whole inferiour world, and having diurnall mo|tion, even from the fir&s;t day, and carrying about with it the light. This firmament therefore by rea&s;on of this diffu&s;ion, exten&s;ion, and expan&s;ion, is properly called <HI>Rakia,</HI> not for the &s;ollidity, or compact force of the &s;ub&s;tance, which <HI>Rakia</HI> doth not &s;ignifie. Neither doth the matter, whereof this firmament is made, nor that expan&s;ion which here <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> attributeth to it; and al&s;o <HI>I&s;ay.</HI> 42.5. and 40.22. Al&s;o <HI>P&s;alme</HI> 104.22. carry with it nece&s;&s;arily &s;uch a &s;olidity, and &s;uch a force of &s;ub&s;tance; nor is to be &s;uppo&s;ed to carry with it; unle&s;&s;e &s;ome argument thereof in the word of God did cleerely ap|peare. The compari&s;on taken from a &s;aile &s;pread and extended with the winds, and a tent firmely &s;et up and di&s;played; doth rather declare the &s;tability, immobility, and incorruptibility of it: &s;uch a firmament would God &s;ignifie, and have to be, that it might be a perpetuall ayde, and upholder, of fraile and corruptible things. And what profit, I pray you, &s;hould be there of the rigidity and force of yron, or hardne&s;&s;e of

the Adamant, where there is no wearing nothing that can corrupt. God al&s;o called this firmament, Heaven, or <HI>Shamaim,</HI> that we might under&s;tand it to be of the &s;ame &s;ub&s;tance with the light, and together with it to have beene Created. Heere is to bee ob&s;erved that <HI>E&s;dras lib.</HI> 4. <HI>cap.</HI> 6. repeating the Creation of the world, &s;aith of this firmament; And on the &s;eaventh day (&s;aith hee) thou created&s;t the &s;pirit of the firmament, and commanded&s;t it &amp;c. The order of the Creation teacheth, the proportion of ponderous and heavie things teacheth, the rarity of &s;ub&s;tance and experience teacheth that by how much higher from the Center of the world bodies are di&s;tant, they are more rarified, lighter and more &s;pirituall: and there|fore it nece&s;&s;arily followeth that tho&s;e things that re&s;ide highe&s;t of all, are mo&s;t &s;piri|tuall. Now this firmament is much higher than the elements, wherefore it is al&s;o much more &s;pirituall than the ayre, and mo&s;t of all in the extreame &s;ublimity of it, where &s;o many &s;tarres have a perpetuall, mo&s;t con&s;tant, and le&s;&s;e variable motion. Now it was nece&s;&s;ary &s;uch a Heaven to be made, after that the ma&s;culine force, which &s;ub&s;i&s;teth in the &s;pirituall &s;ub&s;tance, was to be in&s;erted into it: to helpe the imperfect power of engendring of the&s;e inferiour things. Neither did it &s;uffice, the &s;ub&s;tance thereof to be &s;uch equally throughout the whole, that is to &s;ay, homogeneall, but ac|cording to the variety and nature of things, a variable and turgent fecundity was al|&s;o required, which &s;hould extend it &s;elfe abroad by a naturall inclination to ripen the fruites, of the inferiour world; and as it were to doe the office of a midwife in hel|ping them to bring forth. But that fecundity lyeth in the exundant &s;pirituall e&s;&s;ence, and fortitude thereof, wherefore there neede to be made a collection of this &s;pirituall &s;ub&s;tance, which is in every heaven or part thereof, into one body &s;phericall, as a member genitall. So in the Heaven of the Sunne, the cheife force of the Spirituall &s;ub&s;tance is collected into the Globe of the Sunne: <HI>Mercury,</HI> and <HI>Venus</HI> adjoyned to it for the helpe of generation. So the Moone and the Starres, from the fir&s;t beginning of the created light, according to the exigence of their office, were collected, every one into their &s;everall Globes: and the fourth day finally perfected. Al&s;o the heate and &s;plendour of the light, or rather irradiation was nece&s;&s;ary to the act of the gene|ration of the &s;pirituall vertue, production and intention: wherefore when God crea|ted the light, he made light al&s;o the &s;pirituall &s;ub&s;tance of heaven. Now if it were po&s;&s;ible for any one to know the naturall cau&s;e, and originall of light in &s;ub&s;tance, he &s;hould attaine unto a great mi&s;tery to enquire after, and in &s;ome &s;ort to finde out, the nature of the Starres, which without doubt follow their efficient and materiall cau&s;e, for if thou doe&s;t apply all the &s;ubtilty of thy minde, thou &s;halt &s;ee the creation of things almo&s;t follow the naturall order of cau&s;es, and from cau&s;es to deduce cau&s;es, untill it come to the effect propo&s;ed. And this is the incomprehen&s;ible wi&s;edome of God, that of one fir&s;t created, he did &s;o forme and in&s;titute nature, according to the univer|&s;all Idea, that he may be thought no le&s;&s;e to have imitated, than Created or ordained it. For creating by his will and power the univer&s;all Idea of nature, mo&s;t exactly con|ceived, he doth al&s;o mo&s;t exactly imitate and expre&s;&s;e, that both in the Idea and Fa|bricke, the &s;ame naturall &s;ucce&s;&s;e of things, and of cau&s;es &s;hould appeare.</P>
<P>Oh the mo&s;t wi&s;e, and mo&s;t powerfull wi&s;edome of God, above all admirable! How great ought the affinity of nature be unto its Creatour! <HI>He &s;pake the word, and it was made,</HI> his will is the e&s;&s;ence of it, wherefore as he willeth, &s;o is it, and he willeth it for the &s;ame. God willed, and willed with delectation and &s;tudy, that the Hea|ven, and every Starre in it, by a variable motion, &s;hould &s;erve man, and for man every Creature.</P>
<P>This will, this &s;tudy, even with a certaine delectation, remaineth imprinted in the Heaven: the Heaven willeth the &s;ame, is enclined to the &s;ame, and executeth it dili|gently, with a certaine delectation: the affection of God therefore toward his Crea|ture, is made the affection of one creature towards another. This is the fir&s;t and cheife cau&s;e, and the originall of all Sympathy, whereby every thing is excited to the exe|cution of their duty. It is not needefull that we &s;hould attribute to the Heaven any other cau&s;e, or the Angels to be moovers, as though it were of it &s;elfe immoveable, and di&s;per&s;ed his beames idely and without any affection and Sympathy to inferiour things, where&s;oever it hapneth, and much le&s;&s;e that we &s;hould &s;ay, that it is perpe|tually mooved of a divine Spirit, but by a perpetuall nature, according to his will once

imprinted in it, yet in the meane time if thou wilt perfect this Philo&s;ophy concerning Sympathy, thou mu&s;t enquire what &s;imilitude, what Analogie with the Creatures, and with which of them, he hath given to the Heaven, whereby it is enclined unto them: as al&s;o from whence, by what order, and after what manner that &s;imilitude and Analogy was inducted into it.</P>
<P>But when thou ha&s;t a&s;cended upon this theater, thou wilt cry out, Oh the profun|dities of the riches, wi&s;edome, and Knowledge of God; how incomprehen&s;ible are his Iudgements, and his wayes pa&s;t finding out! which if thou finde&s;t nothing, yet it &s;hall be a great gaine unto thee, to have learned this imper&s;crutability; to the end thou mai&s;t learne more highly to admire the infinite wi&s;edome of God, and with a more ready minde to reverence his Maje&s;ty.</P>
<P>This al&s;o &s;halt thou ea&s;ily gaine, that thou &s;halt find, there is nothing created of God without cau&s;e, and ju&s;t rea&s;on, tending to one &s;cope or end. And now I hope thou under&s;tande&s;t what <HI>E&s;dras</HI> meaneth, when he &s;aith, Thou ha&s;t created the Spirit of the Firmament, and commanded it: to wit, that the coele&s;tiall matter, which is mo&s;t &s;pirituall, perceiving the Word of God, or the impre&s;&s;ion of his will, doth with him put on the &s;ame affection towards man: to wit, that for his cau&s;e waxing hot, is extenuated, is made &s;pirituall, doth elevate it &s;elfe on high, above the Ele|ment of the ayre, extend it &s;elfe, and there remaine fixed; dividing the waters from the waters. Therefore, the cele&s;tiall matter, having from the will of God and his impre&s;&s;ion, obtayned this Sympathy, as yet mixed with the Aire, and turned into a more &s;pirituall e&s;&s;ence, by its owne inclination mounted upward; and this is that which he &s;aith. The &s;econd day was created the Spirit of the firmament, though as yet there was no contraction of the Starres, and Planets, into Globes. It executed al&s;o the re&s;t of the Commandement, to wit, the divi&s;ion out of the &s;ame Sympathy, and inclination the &s;ame day; and remayneth in the &s;ame office, untill the will of God (from the which the Sympathy thereof hath dependance) be accompli&s;hed, as witne&s;&s;eth that of <HI>David P&s;al.</HI> 148. He hath e&s;tabli&s;hed them (the cele&s;tiall things) to endure perpetually and for ever, he hath given them a &s;tatute, and they &s;hall not pa&s;&s;e it.</P>
<P>This Firmament was not any particular heaven divided from others, but one ma|chine of the heavens, as is manife&s;t: for that the fourth day he &s;et the Sunne, Moone, and Starres in this Firmament, comprehending all the Heavens which appeare unto us. But becau&s;e the&s;e bodies which God hath &s;et in the Firmament (and according to the te&s;timony of <HI>David,</HI> e&s;tabli&s;hed with certaine lawes) are found to have divers motions. It appeareth that this heaven is divided into moe heavens, but how many they are we &s;hall probably di&s;cour&s;e in the A&s;tronomicks. But the manner of the divi|&s;ion appeareth in the precedent, when as perpetually the &s;uperour things (as more ex|tenuated, dilated and lighter) have a&s;cended from the inferiour, as the Water from the Earth, the Aire from the Water, the Firmament from the Aire. So without doubt in the common &s;ub&s;tance of the Firmament, by little and little &s;uch an extenuation being made, di&s;cretion and &s;ubduction on high: fir&s;t, in the lowe&s;t place was the &s;phere of the Moone left, and re&s;ted. Secondly, the &s;phere of the Sunne, with <HI>Mer|cury,</HI> and <HI>Venus.</HI> Thirdly, <HI>Mars,</HI> then <HI>Iupiter;</HI> and there after the re&s;t: in manner that the la&s;t &s;eparation of the &s;upercele&s;tiall waters, the &s;ame remaineth and is the highe&s;t part of the machine of the world. The univer&s;all and perpetuall nature of things, as is the law of things, heavie and light ordained of God, requireth the Oeconomy of the di&s;tribution of the heavens. For &s;eeing that all things are created and formed of the fir&s;t, and one &s;elf matter, and therefore do re&s;emble the naturall di&s;po&s;ition thereof, the &s;uperiors would be no otherwi&s;e affected among them&s;elves, than the inferiors a|mong them&s;elves: except we will &s;ay, that when hee came to forme the Heavens, he did make againe the fir&s;t matter, and gave it another much differing e&s;&s;ence, na|ture, and law, but this what were it, but to extenuate the wi&s;edome and power of God, as though he had not made the fir&s;t matter fit for the Creation of all things. This being granted, what communion of natures could there be, between the coele&s;tiall and elementary things? What &s;ympathy? Were not this to di&s;turbe all order of things, and to overthrow Gods &s;cope and intent in his creation? When therefore the univer&s;all law of nature doth &s;o comport it &s;elfe through all things, communicating among them|&s;elves,
<PB N="26" REF="25">
it can be no doubt to any, but that tho&s;e things which proceede from one, con|formable in it &s;elfe, and not di&s;cordant obtaine the &s;ame rea&s;on unto that one, as the Sonne to his Parent, and every thing engendred, to his progenitor expre&s;&s;e in &s;ome &s;ort the nature thereof, and be enclined unto him, as to his beginning bound with the bond of love: Therefore there will be the &s;ame rea&s;on of coele&s;tiall things among them&s;elves, as of Elementaries, &s;eeing that all things were created &s;ucce&s;&s;ively of the &s;ame ma&s;&s;e, conformable and concordant in it &s;elfe, and the &s;uperiours out of their no|blene&s;&s;e and perfection, will embrace the&s;e inferiours, as their beginnings &s;o much the more &s;trongly, by how much they doe more communicate in nature and &s;erve man to their utmo&s;t power. The &s;uperiours al&s;o being more purified, more di&s;tilled, and ex|coct, having a more noble forme &s;uperadded, will be al&s;o the more noble in&s;truments of God, unto his &s;cope, and end, and will more &s;trongly performe their office there|unto. Wherefore in my opinion, that which the A&s;trologians per&s;wade them&s;elves of the malice of <HI>Saturne,</HI> and of <HI>Mars,</HI> is mo&s;t ab&s;urd, as we &s;hall di&s;cour&s;e more at large in the A&s;trologicks.</P>
<P>The Firmament being created and &s;et in his place, was made (&s;aith <HI>Mo&s;es</HI>) from the evening and the morning, the &s;econd day, to wit, beginning from the evening as the fir&s;t, and ending againe at the &s;etting, and couching of the light: The rea&s;on of the day is the &s;ame as before, the which &s;erving all the time of the Creation, it &s;ignifieth, that we ought perpetually to retaine the remembrance of the creation. But hee called this Firmament, Heaven; in Hebrew, <HI>SHAMAIM:</HI> if he called it by a vocall di|&s;tinction, he &s;o called it for <HI>Adam:</HI> otherwi&s;e that which I have &s;aid, for God to &s;ay, to be: this is the very &s;ame as to call; to wit his eternall Will whereby he willed the Firmament to be out of the Waters and made it.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IX. Of the Fabricke of the World. <HI>Of the &s;upercele&s;tiall waters, and the Creation of Angels.</HI></HEAD>
<P>_OF the Supercele&s;tiall waters, there is no where any open mention made, but <HI>Gen.</HI> 1.7. <HI>P&s;al.</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">48, and 4. <HI>E&s;dras</HI> 6.41. Of them the opinions of writers are divers. <HI>Iacobus Zeiglerus</HI> imagineth very fooli&s;hly, that the fir&s;t matter of God was created infinite, lea&s;t there &s;hould be thought any thing to be left without the world void: and that in Creating the world out of that matter, he did not exhau&s;t the infinity thereof, but onely a&s;&s;umed &s;o much as &s;ufficed for the Creation, and left the re&s;t as it was, which he calleth the cele&s;tiall waters, void, and darkene&s;&s;e, which he affirmeth to be excluded from the World, by the Firmament: which opinion is too ab&s;urd.</P>
<P>For how can it be admitted that the infinite wi&s;dome of God &s;hould create any thing in vaine? For that is done altogether in vaine which is left voyd without the world, and of no forme or u&s;e. Which if thou wilt &s;ay was done to fill up that <HI>va|cuum;</HI> I will demand, whether there was any <HI>vacuum</HI> there from Eternity, and whe|ther al&s;o this was not created? It would bring an inextricable Labyrinth of que&s;tions, nor any mea&s;ure, order, and law, in the deduction of the parts of the World, out of the Chaos &s;hould appeare, but all things &s;hould be done without rea&s;on, and without naturall con&s;equence: for there &s;hould be no place of extenuating the matter, dilating, and ennobling it. Others, and truely not a few, thinke the Supercele&s;tiall waters, to be the Clouds, which are carryed in the middle region of the Ayre, and that they are &s;eparated by the inferiour aire, which is al&s;o compri&s;ed under the name of Heaven from the Sea and from the Rivers. But hereunto is contrary the holy Te&s;timony of <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> which giveth the divi&s;ion to that Firmament, wherein the Sunne, Moone, and Starres are placed. For the Aire which is under the Clouds, and &s;ubject to great mutabilities, cannot be called the Firmament: which if they will call the Firmament, becau&s;e of the perpetuall and immutable &s;cituation of it in its place, then &s;hould the
<PB N="27" REF="25">
water al&s;o be the Firmament, but another firmene&s;&s;e is required. Such a Firmament was requi&s;ite (as I have &s;aid) which &s;hould &s;ub&s;i&s;t immutable in &s;ub&s;tance and vertue for ever, to &s;u&s;taine the generation and multiplication of things, according to their Species: but this was made after the light, and therefore after the Aire, for the light could not be without the Aire, which ought to environ the Ma&s;&s;e, and to cary the light, and to make the Day and the Night. Wherefore &s;eeing that this Firmament, and perfected one day after it, without doubt it is another different from this inferiour, and more perfect than it, above the which al&s;o <HI>David</HI> placeth the&s;e waters. Ob&s;erve (<HI>P&s;al.</HI> 148. his order in prai&s;ing of God. Fir&s;t, in generall he citeth cele&s;tiall things to prai&s;e him: then &s;ummoneth all in a ju&s;t order, and di&s;tinctly. Fir&s;t, tho&s;e that in|habite the Heavens, to wit, the Angels and the Spirits of the ble&s;&s;ed, then the parts of the Heavens: the Sunne, Moone, and Starres, that is to &s;ay, the Firmament. Thirdly the Heavens, of heavens, to wit, the Heavens which are the Firmament, and compre|hend it within them&s;elves: or the Heaven of Heavens, as it is <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 113. La&s;t of all hee mooveth the waters which be above the Heavens.</P>
<P>Thou &s;ee&s;t how he proceedeth in order from the ba&s;e&s;t, and lowe&s;t, to the &s;upreme&s;t and highe&s;t: adding al&s;o a &s;ingular and &s;peciall cau&s;e wherefore they ought cheifely to prai&s;e God: to wit, becau&s;e God hath e&s;tabli&s;hed them to endure for ever, and hath given them a law and office which they cannot pa&s;&s;e unaccompli&s;hed. After the ce|le&s;tiall things, he pa&s;&s;eth to the terre&s;tiall, wherein he comprehendeth the winds, light|nings, haile, clouds, foules of the Heaven: to wit, all elementary things, thou &s;ee&s;t then two orders of prai&s;ers: the cele&s;triall and the elementary. Seeing then he pla|ceth the Super-cele&s;tiall waters, among things cele&s;tiall, and immutable, we may in no wi&s;e beleeve them to be the Clouds. And <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 104.3. God is &s;aid to make con|tinguate, to touch one another, to lay the beames of his high chambers (that is to &s;ay, of the world) among the waters: which can be no other but the&s;e waters which are above the heavens.</P>
<P>Now whereof the&s;e waters are created, and to what end, it doth not appeare out of <HI>Mo&s;es.</HI> For &s;eeing they are not vi&s;ible, cannot be perceived with the eye, and do not re|prelent any thing which might be taken of Gentiles, as matter of Idolatry, and further &s;eieng they are the mo&s;t hidden things, and the highe&s;t of the univer&s;e Creature, which cannot be &s;earched out by any man, it imported not much to explicate their originall and end, or &s;cope, wherefore al&s;o <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> concealeth them, and the holy Spirit doth not openly reveale them. Yet doth he not make mention of them in vaine, but of|fereth to godly minds, matter of conceiving &s;omething higher, and intimateth the wi&s;edome of God highly to be admired, and his inexplicable power, where the mo&s;t &s;harpe of the under&s;tanding is dulled, and is not able to pro&s;ecute any further, the wayes and profound depth of them. But the originall and matter of them, from hence may be comprehended, in that he nameth them waters, for he &s;heweth that they are conformable and co-naturall, of the &s;ame nature with the Firmament. As al&s;o <HI>David</HI> when (<HI>P&s;al.</HI> 148.) he attributeth, together with <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> the highe&s;t place in all the univer&s;e unto them. For &s;eeing all things which hitherto, (after the waters mooved, and light created) were made, by order of extenuation, and of perfection, were carired up on high, and fixed in their place, it may not be doubted, but by the &s;ame continued order, it was come to the extreame (as I may &s;o &s;ay) di&s;tillation, and &s;ub|limation, in tho&s;e &s;upercele&s;tiall waters. Then the&s;e waters are the mo&s;t cleare, and pure heaven of all; which the divines rightly call <HI>empyreum,</HI> for &s;eeing there is &s;o great light in the Firmament, and collected out of the &s;ame &s;ub&s;tance of the Firma|ment, which repre&s;enteth to the eyes and &s;en&s;e, pure fire, the &s;ub&s;tance al&s;o of this la&s;t, and mo&s;t purified heaven, mu&s;t be a fire much more noble and re&s;plendant, of an equall clearene&s;&s;e throughout: as in the which there is made no contraction of the light into Globes, which appeareth to be &s;o made, for that God would terminate the Oeconomie of whole nature, with the connexity of the Firmament, and therefore writeth that divi&s;ion of waters to be committed to the Firmament; to the end that we &s;hould under&s;tand, that the workes of nature are there terminated, and doe not extend higher than the &s;upreame extremity thereof: to wit, the convexity of the fir&s;t moveable; but that they are wholly contained within it, and that without that con|vexity, all things are quiet and immoveable.</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="26">Now for what end this Supercele&s;tiall water, and this mo&s;t cleare Heaven was created. I will &s;ay which to me &s;eemeth probable.

But when the&s;e Angels were created, it is not ea&s;y to &s;ay.

<P>The Sonnes of God could be no other than the Angels, for man as then was not Created: Now if the Angels &s;ang prai&s;es to God the Creatour, then when he e&s;ta|bli&s;hed the Earth upon the corner &s;tone, and together with them, the bright &s;hining Starres gave prai&s;e: therefore the third day the Angels were, and al&s;o the Starres were, although as yet imperfect. For the fir&s;t day in the morning they beganne to be crea|ted, and the fourth day were perfected, therefore they were much more then halfe perfected, and begunne to &s;hine, the light being extended, and to prai&s;e and glorifie God in his &s;ervice and obedience. But that place in <HI>Iob</HI> 38.6. hath relation to the third day of the Creation, thou maye&s;t ea&s;ily under&s;tand, if thou compare&s;t the two precedent ver&s;es. For in the fir&s;t, he &s;peaketh of the fir&s;t Foundation of the Earth, that is, when God gave it a place of re&s;t, the Center of the univer&s;e: which is the ve|ry <HI>ba&s;is</HI> of the Earth.</P>
<P>Of this foundation &s;peaketh <HI>David, P&s;.</HI> 104.5. Saying, thou ha&s;t e&s;tabli&s;hed the Earth upon her Ba&s;es, that it &s;hould not be mooved for ever. In the other he &s;peaketh of the figure which the Earth hath obtained by its weight, on every &s;ide equally affecting the Center; to wit, Sphericall. But in the &s;ixt ver&s;e, fir&s;t, he maketh a mo&s;t profound que&s;tion, to wit, how that Center which is the ba&s;is of heavy things, &s;hould be fixed: &s;eeing it hangeth of the fluent, and moveable Ayre? Immediately after he &s;peaketh of the &s;uper&s;truction which is accu&s;tomed to be elevated on high, and pre&s;&s;eth chiefely unto the Angles, or corners of the edifices. Who (&s;aith he) hath laid the corner &s;tone, which &s;u&s;taineth the Ma&s;&s;e, a&s;cending up on high? Thou &s;ee&s;t three parts of the earth brought in que&s;tion, to be &s;etled and e&s;tabli&s;hed, in that order wherein they mutu|ally &s;ucceeded one another in the Creation, For fir&s;t the Chaos being created, the Earth began to &s;ettle into the Center. Secondly, in the &s;etling received a Sphericall figure. Thirdly, the Earth at length becommeth dry, &s;hewed it &s;elfe above the wa|ters, and was there e&s;tabli&s;hed, yea, the mo&s;t high Mountaines thereafter hanging a|bove the waters. Of which e&s;tabli&s;hment <HI>David</HI> &s;peaketh thus (<HI>P&s;al,</HI> 24.2.) For he hath founded it upon the Seas, and e&s;tabli&s;hed it upon the Floods. The &s;ixt ver&s;e demandeth in the &s;econd part, who hath rai&s;ed the&s;e mo&s;t high hilly tops, &s;o great a di&s;tance above the waters, and &s;o e&s;tabli&s;hed them, that they fall not, and returne not to their owne naturall place? Seeing therefore the firmene&s;&s;e and &s;tability of the&s;e was made the third day, when the Earth was made dry, &s;olid, and firme, it is alto|gether manife&s;t, that the Angels were created before this &s;cicity, and firmitude was accompli&s;hed: to wit, the &s;econd day. And with this agreeth mo&s;t elegantly, the Creation of the Super-cele&s;tiall waters, made the &s;econd day: out of which it is very likely the Angels were created. For there was no &s;ub&s;tance in the whole Creature more fit hereunto, then that cleare and ardent Aire, in the which the Creatour plea|&s;ed that they &s;hould have their &s;eate, and habitation. Neither was there any other element more convenient for their bodies, than from whence they &s;hould take their &s;pirit. And <HI>Paul. Heb.</HI> 1. te&s;tifieth that the Angels are Spirits, and a flame of fire, that is to &s;ay cleare &s;pirits, like the mo&s;t cleare flame, as is almo&s;t the &s;ub&s;tance in the Empyreall Heaven: So that the Angels &s;eeme to be created of the &s;upercele&s;tiall waters; as the Starres: but animated rationall, and mooving them&s;elves up on high, and downe below for the &s;ervice of God: whereupon they are called Angels of light, that is to &s;ay, light &s;hining Angels, created out of the light, and dwelling in heavenly light, and doe appeare unto men with great clearene&s;&s;e of light: as to the Shepheards.

<HEAD>CHAP. X. Of the Fabricke of the World. <HI>Of the Congregating of the elementary waters: and preparation of the Earth for generation.</HI> The third Day beginneth.</HEAD>
<P>_THE third Day God &s;aid, <HI>Let the waters which are under the Heaven be gathered together into one place, and that which is dry appeare. Mo&s;es</HI> minded not to &s;ay, that finally the third day he &s;aid this, and began to &s;eparate: but that his eternall will was that this third day, the divi|&s;ion of the earth and water &s;hould be perfected, and the earth be dry|ed up, and &s;hould appeare more high above the waters, having recei|ved the waters within her bo&s;omes, to be the &s;eate and habitation to all future living creatures, and a &s;torehou&s;e to afford all &s;u&s;tenance: What things &s;oever are in God are eternall: his will of dividing, as well as of creating was from eternity; and al&s;o of accompli&s;hing the divi&s;ion, this day was eternall: and it was fini&s;hed he willed it to be made from eternity, and approoved of it eternally. His &s;entence &s;tandeth fa&s;t, whereof he cannot repent, it cannot be redargued, reprooved, amended, nor better conceived, becau&s;e his wi&s;edome and prudence is infinite, and doth admit no change of coun&s;ell and will. Therefore &s;eeing this day the divi&s;ion was compleate: God &s;aid, (&s;aith <HI>Mo&s;es</HI>) that is to &s;ay, from all eternity, that the divi&s;ion &s;hould be made, and that which is dry appeare, that is to &s;ay, that the divi&s;i|on &s;hould be made untill that which is made &s;hould appeare. And when did the dry appeare? even now the third day of the Creation: for he addeth and it was &s;o, to wit, e|ven now incontinent after the &s;econd day, which a little before he &s;aid was compleate, and before the end of the third day, which he will conclude after in the third ver&s;e.</P>
<P>Now if any one would comprehend together, the divi&s;ion begunne, and perfected in one day, what con&s;titution there was of the order, and law of nature, in the crea|tion, when as now we &s;ee it to worke &s;ucce&s;&s;ively, and by cau&s;es, and con&s;equent meanes? It will then nece&s;&s;arily follow, that God hath created all things without any order, and law of nature, and that after he ordayned and gave the&s;e things to na|ture: which were very ab&s;urd, and impious to thinke: for things ought to bring with them their nature, and law of working from the Creation, unle&s;&s;e we &s;hould thinke that God in creating wanted either coun&s;ell, or was not of power &s;ufficient. When therefore in the &s;econd ver&s;e he mooved the waters with a &s;trong bla&s;t; wee under&s;tand that he in&s;tituted the naturall cau&s;e, in the workes following, and that from the time the Earth was begunne to be &s;eparated from the water: but that the third day this &s;eparation was perfected, and compleate.</P>
<P>This naturall cau&s;e of &s;eparation being ob&s;erved, the cau&s;e al&s;o of the inequality of the Earth, and of the Gulphes of the Sea may be knowne. For this by this violence of the winde, this <HI>Aphar</HI> created in the beginning, it &s;o came from diver&s;e parts, that it ele|vated very high, and from hence cellected the low &s;etled earth up aloft, but thereupon made deepe, and great valleyes. Thou wilt thinke then that in that part in the which is now the Atlanticke Sea, a mo&s;t vehement wind to have fallen upon <HI>Aphar,</HI> and in like maner in that part where now A&s;ia, and new India are divided: &amp; that the &s;ame winds have made in the &s;ame place va&s;t concavities of the low &s;etled Earth, and have heaped and rai&s;ed it up on high into the firme lands: al&s;o that from hence are rai&s;ed divers boi|&s;terous winds, w^c^h have cau&s;ed the le&s;&s;er concavities, &amp; the waters being on both &s;ides carried on high, have conge&s;ted the earth into mountaines, &s;o by the calli&s;&s;ion, reper|cu&s;&s;ion or beating of the waters one again&s;t another, thou mai&s;t under&s;tand, that the
<PB N="30" REF="27">
earth was &s;eparated from the Waters, and collected through the middle region into mo&s;t high mountaines. So through Africa the hill <HI>Atlas,</HI> and the hils of the Moone. By A&s;ia, the Mountaine Imaus, and the Ca&s;pian Mountaines, and other Mountaines every where produced. Now the waters after a long agitation being purified from all earth, and collected into tho&s;e places, re&s;ided where the Lord &s;et unto them abound: as <HI>David</HI> &s;aith, <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 103. <HI>ver.</HI> 9. to wit when as all heavie things approach as neare as ever they can to the center of the world, and the water which is fluent, and gliding not able to con&s;i&s;t accumulated as the Earth can; it doth alwayes glide downeward to the neather place, untill it come to the very bottome, the plummet, or lead, from whence it cannot a&s;cend againe, unle&s;&s;e a more heavie thing po&s;&s;e&s;&s;e the bottome. Thereof it commeth, that all waters not being oppo&s;ed, or &s;topped by higher barres, doe runne into the &s;ea.</P>
<P>Now here it is to be thought, the Sunne, the Moone, and the other Starres, to be &s;o farre forth collected and compacted together, that in the nature which is given them, they begin to have more vehement forces. For now they encrea&s;ed unto the third day, in clearene&s;&s;e of light, and naturall vertue, wherefore it is certaine that it helped much in drying up of the earth. The Wind al&s;o in &s;ome &s;ort as yet blowing through the aire, drew out of myre and dirt, humors perfectly excocted, and extenuated by the Sunne: that for two cau&s;es the earth might be dried up, and grow into a greater &s;olidi|tie without the which it had remained fluxative, and (relap&s;ed to the deepe places) had, according to its nature, &s;etled under the Waters: to wit, as being more heavie; and therefore forcing them upwards. But wee mu&s;t under&s;tand this &s;iccitie of the earth, not to be ab&s;olute, but in mediocritie: &s;o great as &s;ufficed for the e&s;tabli&s;hment of the earth, and creation of Plants. For the hearbes were created before it ever rained, which have neede of moi&s;ture, and man was formed of clay the &s;ixth day. But withall con&s;ider this, if the earth had beene altogether dry, it could not have beene rai&s;ed into high mountaines, and remaine firme. For there is a certaine moi&s;ture which bindeth the earth, whereof comming to be deprived, yet glideth away as the &s;and; neither had it beene fit for the engendring of tho&s;e things, which God would produce in the bowells thereof. Here is al&s;o to be ob&s;erved, how great the wi&s;edome of the Creator was in making hollow the&s;e bayes, and channels, as receptacles of the Waters; for &s;o hath he di&s;tributed the &s;ea throughout the whole world, that all the kingdomes of the world may have commerce one with another, and what things &s;oe|ver either nature or art affordeth, may tran&s;port whether they will. And (which is mo&s;t of all) that the Earth, with the Waters collected together, making one &s;phere, might remaine in one equall ballance: for otherwi&s;e the Earth &s;hould not be e&s;ta|bli&s;hed upon the Waters, but the more heavie weight being collected into one part, &s;hould pre&s;&s;e downe all the ma&s;&s;e of the Earth, towards the center of gravitie, and of the world, and that depre&s;&s;ion of the Earth, having elevated more high, and aloft, the Waters lying on the other part, would have cau&s;ed them to overflow, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;e the next adjoyning Ilands. For after that the Earth in the &s;ame quantitie is heavier than the Waters, it is nece&s;&s;ary that the body of the Earth con&s;i&s;t by it &s;elfe in an equall ballance: And al&s;o that the Seas environing the orbe of the Earth, and communicating together, &s;hould be &s;o di&s;tributed, that on every &s;ide lying in an equall ballance, they &s;hould not bring more weight into one halfe of the &s;phere, in what circle &s;oever you compa&s;&s;e it, than in another thereunto oppo&s;ite.</P>
<P>If the Seas did not communicate together, but &s;ome remained &s;hut up within their owne bayes and chanels, the Earth could in &s;ome &s;ort (although not throughout, and in it &s;elfe) con&s;i&s;t equally ballanced. For what weight wanted in one halfe thereof the Waters would &s;upply &s;hut up in it. But &s;eeing the u&s;e and office of the Seas, re|quired a communion of them among them&s;elves, for the nece&s;&s;ary circuit of Naviga|tion: the &s;ame al&s;o the exoncration and disburthening of Rivers requireth, which by the onely communication of the Seas equally, and according to an equall ballance, may be di&s;tributed into all the parts of the Sphere; it was fir&s;t and chiefely nece&s;&s;ary (as I have &s;aid) that the Earth &s;hould remaine in an equall ballance, neither could that be &s;upplied by the Waters: for they &s;hould be rai&s;ed, and heaped up higher, in the lighter, then in the heavier part: and therefore &s;hould flow downe, till they had obtained an equall height on every &s;ide from the Center. Now if we grant, that the&s;e
<PB N="31" REF="27">
waters &s;upplying that equall ballance, are &s;hut in, that they cannot flow out: yet two inconveniences would follow; the one, that being &s;ubject to corruption, they would infect tho&s;e things next unto them, and &s;hould not be &s;o u&s;efull for humane things as they ought: the other, that the earth having drawne their &s;ub&s;tance into her bowels, or being by little and little extracted by exhalation, they &s;hould abandon their place, and take away that equality that retaineth the whole, that it cannot budge one way nor o|ther. Which if any one will maintaine that the Waters may be there con&s;erved, wee will an&s;wer that in vaine are employed a great number of meanes (wherein there is more operative labour, and to the re&s;t unprofitable) to doe that which may be done without the &s;ame: and indeede both more compendiou&s;ly, and more profitably. Whereby then the &s;entence &s;tandeth fa&s;t, that the machine of the earth is in it &s;elfe e|qually ballanced without budging one way or other, and con&s;equently al&s;o the Sea, which is contained within the bo&s;ome of it. And al&s;o that the Sea is in continuall mo|tion, le&s;t it &s;hould be corrupted and infect the aire, and kill the fi&s;hes. Moreover, it wa&s;heth the Earth both within and without, that all things &s;hould be cleane and whole&s;ome: all corruption being con&s;umed and di&s;&s;ipated by motion and attrition. The con&s;titution of the weight of the Center, and of the world importeth all the&s;e things: which if they had beene knowne, and examined by the ancients, they had judged almo&s;t true, that which is of the &s;ituation, and greatne&s;&s;e of the continent of the new land found out in our age: and the Meridionall continent, not yet di&s;covered &s;i|tuate under the Pole Antarticke. For &s;eeing that the lands knowne to the continent, and comprehended in a hundred eightie degrees of longitude, that is to &s;ay, doe onely po&s;&s;e&s;&s;e the one halfe of the Sphere, it was nece&s;&s;ary there &s;hould be al&s;o as much land in the other halfe. And &s;eeing that A&s;ia, Europe, and Africa, for the greater part, are &s;ituated beyond the Equinoctiall towards the North, it was nece&s;&s;ary as great a conti|nent to remaine under the Pole Antarticke, which &s;hould be equivalent in the other lands, with the meridionall parts of A&s;ia, or new India or America.</P>
<P>God (as &s;aith <HI>Mo&s;es</HI>) called the dry land <HI>EREZ,</HI> &s;eparated from the Waters, and prepared for the life of living creatures, that is to &s;ay, the Earth and the Waters ga|thered together, <HI>MAIM,</HI> that is the Seas. But it is not to be thought, that &s;o &s;oone as this &s;eparation was made, he gave the&s;e names no more than before, the names of the day, of the night, and of the heaven. For to whom &s;hould hee have told them, when as man (whom it chiefely concerned to know the&s;e workes) was not yet crea|ted? Vnle&s;&s;e any will maintaine, that they were told to the Angels. But I hold for an a&s;&s;ured truth that here is in&s;inuated another, and a very great my&s;terie, to wit, a te&s;timony of the immen&s;e love, and mo&s;t loving and bountifull conver&s;ation of God with man, whom with a &s;ingular purpo&s;e, and affectionate &s;tudy he created. For I thinke that this manife&s;tation of names, &s;ignified not that pre&s;ent day it was, but after in a familiar conference with <HI>Adam.</HI> For when God brought the creatures to <HI>Adam</HI> that he &s;hould give them names, there is no doubt but he had longer &s;peech with him, and treated with him amply of the Creation: naming the light, the day, the night, the heaven, the earth, the &s;ea, the Moone, and principall parts of the world: by meanes whereof hee might leave to his po&s;teritie the true Hi&s;tory of all this great worke; as al&s;o to be con&s;erved in &s;ome mea&s;ure after <HI>Adam,</HI> even to <HI>Mo&s;es.</HI></P>
<P>This word <HI>EREZ</HI> (that I may u&s;e the words of <HI>Augu&s;tine Eugebine</HI>) properly &s;ig|nifieth that which is trampled and troden upon, derived of the word <HI>RAZAZ:</HI> the letter <HI>Aleph</HI> added according to the proprietie of the Hebrew tongue, which de|mon&s;tateth the coun&s;ell and intention of creating the earth. For it was created, to the end that the mo&s;t excellent creatures, for the which all things were created might tread, and walke upon it. <HI>MAIM,</HI> which is as much to &s;ay, as rea&s;ounding, braying, tu|multuating; commeth of the verbe <HI>Hamah,</HI> which &s;ignifieth, to bray, cry, and make a noi&s;e. From this deduction therefore of the &s;aid <HI>Augustine,</HI> it appeareth, that <HI>EREZ</HI> and <HI>MAIM,</HI> &s;ignifie &s;uch an earth, and &s;uch waters, which is now the earth that &s;erveth as a payement to terre&s;triall creatures, and a &s;tay to them which walke and re&s;t upon it; and the va&s;t &s;ea, which being gathered together by the exag|geration of the Rivers, hath a perpetuall fluxe and refluxe roaring and making a great noi&s;e. And truely, &s;eeing the Latine word <HI>Terra,</HI> is derived of <HI>tero,</HI> it an&s;wereth very properly to the word <HI>EREZ.</HI> Note this al&s;o, which the &s;ame <HI>Augu&s;tine</HI> admoni&s;h|eth,

<HEAD>CHAP. XI. Of the Fabricke of the World.
<HI>Of the fourefold degree and order of things created.</HI></HEAD>
<P>_HItherto hath beene no other creation but of tho&s;e things, which pertained to the generation of things nece&s;&s;ary to the life of man; and might &s;erve them for their habitations, to wit, the Elements, of which, or by the which the&s;e things ought to be engendred and &s;u&s;tained. Common &s;en&s;e divi|deth all things created into three cla&s;&s;es, or rather degrees; into tho&s;e things which have a being; tho&s;e things which have life or facultie vegetive; and tho&s;e things which have &s;en&s;e. Which divi&s;ion well under&s;tood and con&s;idered, agreeth very elegantly to our &s;ubject, and aideth greatly our &s;peculations, and giveth under&s;tanding. In the fir&s;t degree, it behoveth not to under&s;tand one naked e&s;&s;ence, without all forme, qualitie, and efficacie, &s;uch as the Philophers dreamed the fir&s;t matter to be: for I have &s;hewed that God never created any &s;uch thing, but it behoveth to under&s;tand the things, the which what&s;oever they are invertue and power, yet are they without all motion: that in what&s;oever place they are, there they re&s;t, there hang, there by them&s;elves they remaine immoveable, neither doe a&s;&s;ume to them&s;elves any augmentation, or, to &s;peake more plainely, which have not in them&s;elves force of encrea&s;ing: but as nature fir&s;t formed them, &s;o they are, and remaine, not having in them any life. In the &s;econd de|gree are all things which have in them the fir&s;t degree of life, to wit, facultie vegeta|tive, and vertue of encrea&s;ing, and a&s;pire no higher unto life. In the third degree are tho&s;e things which (be&s;ides vertue vegetative) have al&s;o &s;en&s;itive, and move them|&s;elves by their owne proper vertue, according to the condition of their &s;ence. Hither|to the degrees of the Creation proceede from the fir&s;t matter: and becau&s;e the vulger opinion is, that the &s;pirit of man (by which onely hee differeth from bruit bea&s;ts) is not created of the fir&s;t matter, but particularly and &s;ingularly of God: they doe put man him&s;elfe in the number of other living creatures, and comprehend him in the third de|gree of creatures. But when I &s;hall have &s;hewed in his place, that even the &s;pirit of man is extracted out of the fir&s;t matter, by intermediate degrees of perfection, it will appeare that wee mu&s;t con&s;titute in him a fourth degree of creatures. Therefore the fir&s;t degree is of tho&s;e things which are. The &s;econd of tho&s;e things which are, and have a vegetative vertue, which is the fir&s;t degree of life. The third, of tho&s;e things which are, which live, and have &s;ence: and by &s;ence move voluntarily. The fourth of tho&s;e things which are, which live, have &s;ence, under&s;tand, and di&s;|cour&s;e: for the &s;uperiour degrees comprehend the inferiour. To the&s;e foure degrees it behoveth a Philo&s;opher diligently to apply his minde, and a&s;cending, and procee|ding by the&s;e degrees, to ob&s;erve the order of the Creation. Neither yet is it to bee imagined, that all tho&s;e things which are of the fir&s;t degree were procreated before things which are of the &s;econd: for it was not nece&s;&s;ary that precious &s;tones, and mettalls &s;hould be before hearbes. For we mu&s;t &s;et downe this in the fir&s;t place: that tho&s;e things were fir&s;t to be created, which were fir&s;t mo&s;t requi&s;ite for the u&s;e of man. Pearles and mettalls, though they had beene created long after man, could bring nor cau&s;e no di&s;commoditie at all unto him. But thou wilt &s;ay unto me, it was nece&s;&s;ary tho&s;e things to have beene created before the &s;eaventh day; thou &s;aie&s;t well, but un|der&s;tand, it is to be judged, tho&s;e things then to have beene created, when God com|manded
<PB N="33" REF="28">
the earth to engender them: for the earth is ordayned to be the mother of the&s;e things, and remayneth mother, and in her &s;elfe, and of her &s;elfe conceiveth &s;eed, whereof &s;he produceth perpetually the&s;e things, and according to her fecundity per|fecteth them in their time. But the tardity and &s;lowne&s;&s;e of the perfection of a new &s;pecies, doth not hinder generation; becau&s;e it is the la&s;t and doth not engender con|&s;equently. For if one pearle &s;hould procreate another pearle, and one mettall another like unto it &s;elfe, then was it nece&s;&s;ary a &s;pecificall and &s;eminary vertue to have beene given to mettall, and pearle: which was the proper worke of the Creator, and not of the earth. So had it beene al&s;o nece&s;&s;ary, that pearles, and mettals &s;hould have been perfected, and received from God into them, a &s;pecificall vertue before the &s;eaventh day. So that we ob&s;erve the order expre&s;&s;ed in the generation of the world, it &s;ee|meth that it behooved to have beene made, the third day; for there &s;hould have beene a like manner of engendring, both in the one, and the other: and both the one, and the other, &s;hould have beene numbred in the &s;ame degree: to wit, of things vegita|tive, and alike increa&s;ed in growth, the one, as the other. Therefore &s;eeing that the Seminary faculty of the&s;e things con&s;i&s;teth in the earth; although &s;ome a&s;i&s;tant, and (perhaps) formative vertue come from the cele&s;tials; it is to be thought that the Crea|tion of the&s;e things was then perfected, when the &s;eminary property, and generative vertue was given of the Lord to the earth which neverthele&s;&s;e according to the natu|rall progre&s;&s;e of things it is credible was done the third day, when as the earth was &s;ufficiently made &s;olid, and the &s;tarres now next had received their compleate forme. No inconvenience therefore doth from thence ari&s;e if mettals, and pearles, and all things which in like manner are engendred of the earth, have not a proper ver|tue of propagating their &s;pecies: they are &s;aid to have beene procreated certaine yeares after, when as the &s;eminary property, and &s;pecificall vertue, which maketh the ge|neration compleate, was in the beginning given to the earth.</P>
<P>Heere now is pre&s;ented a double con&s;ideration of generation, which mu&s;t be pru|dently di&s;tingui&s;hed, to the end that the ju&s;t order of the Creation, manife&s;tly repre|&s;ented in <HI>Gene&s;is,</HI> be not di&s;turbed: and that the rea&s;on of the order may be through|ly knowne. There is one property of the generation of the &s;ame &s;pecies, which al|wayes produceth his like, as a hor&s;e produceth a hor&s;e, a &s;heepe a &s;heepe &amp;c. to the ve|ry end of the world, becau&s;e it is done of its proper &s;ub&s;tance, and by its proper ver|tue of engendring, Of the admirable my&s;tery whereof we will &s;peake in the Chap|ter following. Another generation there is which engendreth not his like, but diffe|ring in &s;pecies, according to the quality of the Spirits of a divers kind which concurre together. So the Earth engendreth gold, &s;ulphur, lead, and &s;uch like things, unlike unto it &s;elfe and of another Species: the vertue whereof it hath in it &s;elfe from the Creation, and not after, not doth acquire it any where el&s;e; but from the worke|ma&s;ter the Creator.</P>
<P>You &s;ee then a double generation of Species, of the which that which is made of the &s;ame Species, requireth al&s;o the perfection of the &s;pecies within &s;ix dayes of the Crea|tion: whereby it may receive from the Creatour this &s;pecificall faculty of engendring, which neither the Earth, nor the heaven, nor any &s;pecies before created can give: it on|ly belongeth to the Creator, to communicate this vertue to the &s;pecies that are created. And therefore although that the waters had produced the fir&s;t &s;pecies of fi&s;hes, and fly|ing foules, yet he did not make the &s;ame &s;pecificall vertue perpetuall, &amp; proper to them all, but perfected the &s;ame vertue begun with the living Creatures, in the proper mat|ter of the &s;ame &s;pecies, taken from the waters, &amp; imprinted in it, and gave it unto them, &s;aying, <HI>Encrea&s;e, and multiply, and fill the waters of the Sea, and let foule multiply in the Earth.</HI> But what&s;oever &s;pecies received not this benediction, they could not be multi|plyed of them&s;elves, but have a certaine accidentary generation other where: to wit, of a certaine element, or elements, whereunto God hath imparted that vertue of genera|tion, then no doubt when every of them, having obtained a perfect &s;pecies, received al|&s;o his proper nature, and his proper &s;pirit, as al&s;o he communicated this &s;ame vertue to perfect living Creatures. And therefore &s;eeing that the &s;pecificall vertue of the&s;e &s;pe|cies was imprinted in the elements already perfect, it was not nece&s;&s;ary to produce &s;tones, pearles, mettals, and &s;uch like to be con&s;picuous before the &s;eaventh day; for their Creation was already effected in the elements. Neither had they neede of any
<PB N="34" REF="29">
further creation; their generation depending now naturally from the elements.</P>
<P>Now the&s;e degrees of things being con&s;tituted, let tho&s;e who are &s;tudious of the farther &s;ecrets of Philo&s;ophy, take diligent heed, which of the&s;e are mo&s;t noble, and by what order, by what al&s;o, and how many meanes they are brought to the per|fection of their Species. But becau&s;e the under&s;tanding, and rea&s;on, adde &s;omething above &s;ence, and motive vertue, and this hath more than the vegetative: and againe, that this is the fir&s;t acce&s;&s;e of tho&s;e things which are unto life, it is ea&s;ie to be under|&s;tood, that by the &s;ame order that the&s;e degrees are numbred, they are al&s;o formed and enabled by nature. We have an example of all in the generation of man, in whom the &s;pecificall vertue imprinted by the Parents in the &s;eed, and therein produced, fir&s;t, formeth the body, and the entralls, which all the while till the heart be formed, con|&s;i&s;t in the fir&s;t degree; but &s;o &s;oone as the heart is formed receive a vegetative nature, and beginne to attract to them&s;elves nouri&s;hment, and to grow, but in the end almo&s;t of &s;ixe weekes, having obtained the third degree, they moove: and then truely, can a man di&s;cover no appearance at all of under&s;tanding, or of a rea&s;onable &s;oule in the fruite, even from the fir&s;t conception: if we grant that the &s;oule was engendred of the Parents, but then as yet it is formed, and fini&s;hed la&s;t, as being the mo&s;t noble. All generation then proceedeth from the ignoble to the more noble, and is perfected by the &s;overaigne degree of every Species, nor doth a&s;cend further. For nothing is a|ble to overpa&s;&s;e the bound of his &s;pecies, becau&s;e further forces of extending it &s;elfe, are not given to it, but the benediction of generation is terminated in the &s;ame &s;pecies. So tho&s;e things which onely are, although in nobility they excell others in their kind, yet they cannot attaine to the power of growing. Of tho&s;e things which have the faculty vegetative, &s;ome are more noble than others: but they cannot attaine unto &s;ence: and living creatures, who&s;e marke in their &s;pecies is &s;en&s;e and motion, doe not attaine unto under&s;tanding: for this &s;urpa&s;&s;eth all things, and repre&s;enteth the I|mage of God.</P>
<P>The &s;ame order (now Reader) thou wilt ob&s;erve to have beene kept in the creati|on of things: for hitherto God hath created the things which are: hereafter, (the more noble &s;ub&s;tance being taken from the&s;e) he will create tho&s;e things, which are of the &s;econd degree, to wit, hearbes, and plants; that done, living creatures, which are of the third degree, and among them; fir&s;t, tho&s;e things, which come from the wa|ters, and more ignoble, after the terre&s;trials, which being endowed with a more &s;ub|tle, dry, and warmer &s;pirit, are al&s;o more &s;ubtile in &s;en&s;e, and approach &s;omething to the under&s;tanding: Finally man him&s;elfe, who &s;hould have the dominion over the o|ther in rea&s;on and wi&s;edome: So the more noble are la&s;t after all created, becau&s;e they have neede of a more noble matter, and more purified and dige&s;ted, and there|fore they are later perfected: nature, which was fir&s;t created, alwayes working ac|cording to the &s;pirit, and manner given him from Gods Idea. But the Idea of God, is the worke of his wi&s;edome, the will of order, vertue, and proportion of things to be created, and &s;u&s;tained. In &s;umme, if any man will &s;earch more diligently the or|der of things, and con&s;ider the communion and difference of Species, he will perceive that the Creation of things (beginning from the more ba&s;e and ignoble Species) &s;o al|mo&s;t a&s;cended upward, as a tree hath at fir&s;t but onely a truncke, wherein all things which are from the roote to the very top, are but one and the &s;ame thing by the com|munion of Species, every of the parts in the meane time having their veines therein: but when they beginne to have any difference among them&s;elves, the fir&s;t divi&s;ion of the truncke is made into branches, after (every branch remayning a certaine time un|till their veines divide them&s;elves one from another) is made the &s;econd divi&s;ion, and &s;o con&s;equently untill we come to the la&s;t branches and fruits. So the Chaos is the onely truncke of all the Species to be created, having his roote and beginning in the univer&s;all Idea Creatrix, which is in the mind, and divine will. In this truncke all things as yet are one, lying hid and communicating in the &s;eminary propriety of the Chaos. Furthermore, as this univer&s;all Idea, creatrix of things, by the divi&s;ion of the &s;pecies into their determinate number and forme, a&s;cending by little and little, doth divide it &s;elfe, &s;o of one &s;imple &s;pecies of Chaos without forme, the difference of &s;pecies by little and little doe ari&s;e, for &s;o long the &s;ub&s;tances of all the de&s;tinated &s;pecies remaine one, untill they tend perfectly to the difference in that wherein they
<PB N="35" REF="29">
communicate. Whence tho&s;e things which as yet communicate, being contained in one branch, doe cohere and &s;ticke together, untill they come into the way of their pro|per &s;pecies, every one following their owne high, and extreame, and perfect &s;pecies. So there being of all the parts, as through all the branches of the Creature, made all excoction, di&s;tillation, purification, extenuation; &s;ublimation, or after what el&s;e &s;o|ever this la&s;t act, tending to the extreame end of operation, is to be named, at length we come to all &s;pecies conceived. But that is to be remembred, that tho&s;e things which are of a mo&s;t high degree are more &s;lowly perfected. Seeing they a&s;cend by intermediate degrees. So a living creature &s;eeing he a&s;cendeth by three degrees, to wit, by being, and by a vegetative &s;pecies, even unto &s;en&s;e and motion, it is nece&s;&s;a|ry that that which is vegetative be perfected in one degree fir&s;t. For &s;o it is to be thought of that univer&s;all Idea, which is in God, that it doth &s;o make its impre&s;&s;ions in the Creation, that beginning from the truncke by inconfu&s;ed order, and right way, it doth by little and little goe by the le&s;&s;e noble, and more noble &s;pecies, to the produ|ction of the highe&s;t, and perfecteth together tho&s;e that are of the &s;ame degree: after tho&s;e which are of a &s;equent, and more noble ranck, as we &s;ee in the creation of plants, living Creatures, and of man.</P>
<P>Now the &s;pecies, which con&s;i&s;t in one degree, or are of one kind, as in the kinde of plants, the willow, and the Oake; are di&s;tingui&s;hed by certaine degrees, or by a kind of excellence, and noblene&s;&s;e one from another, wherefore there is &s;ome thing more perfect, and more noble, and later effected in the one than in the other, thence it com|meth that the Oake groweth and increa&s;eth more &s;lowly than the willow, yet never|thele&s;&s;e the Creation of the Oake was fini&s;hed the third day, as well as that of the wil|low. For (as we &s;hall anon &s;ee) the &s;pecificall vertue is brought forth together with the bud of the hearbe, and imprinted in the plant by the Idea formatrix. For the crea|tion of things which are like to engender like to them&s;elves, is fini&s;hed by the&s;e two, to wit, by the &s;ame &s;pecies, and by the &s;pecificall vertue, that is to &s;ay of propagating the &s;pecies: the encrea&s;ements which follow after, and the generation of fruits are naturall workes of the &s;ame &s;pecies, which follow that vertue and the Creation. But heere it behooveth to remember what we have &s;aid in the &s;eaventh Chapter, which is, that &s;o &s;oone as the matter of any thing was prepared, there withal together the &s;pecies of things to be created was brought forth; although the thing it &s;elfe was of later growth, as the Sunne begunne to be Created the fir&s;t day, when God Created the light, and yet was not perfected till the fourth day. So the waters being prepared, the &s;pecies of fi&s;hes begunne to be created the third day, and the earth being dryed up, the &s;pecies of terre&s;triall living creatures: and yet the&s;e things were not perfected till the fifth day. So the third day the &s;pecies al&s;o of hearbes, and plants began to be crea|ted, and yet were not fini&s;hed till the fourth day. For <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> onely noteth the time when the workes were fini&s;hed. The &s;pecies therefore of plants, and of terre&s;triall living creatures, were brought forth when the earth, the mother of them, was per|fectly fini&s;hed: but the things of a more &s;olid &s;ub&s;tance were fini&s;hed, as the Oake the fourth day did grow later than the hearbes. The&s;e things concerning the degrees and order of things to be created and con&s;idered, come we now to the creation of plants, which is the other part of the worke of this third Day.</P>

<P>_AFter the &s;eparation of the waters (which are under the heaven) from the Earth, during the bla&s;t, as yet followed the other worke of this day, the Creation of hearbes, whereof now we will treate. Fora&s;much as man, and the other living Creatures, were to live of hearbes and fruites, the creation pa&s;&s;eth to the &s;econd degree of things, which is the fir&s;t of life,
<PB N="36" REF="30">
and becau&s;e they were to &s;erve for their nouri&s;hment, God found out a meanes where|by they &s;hould be multiplyed by &s;eed, and &s;pecificall vertue, or propagative, which God ble&s;&s;ed that they might &s;uffice unto all living Creatures. For although the bene|diction of multiplication be not added, a man may well under&s;tand that it was done, be|cau&s;e he hath annexed it to other Creatures and <HI>ver&s;.</HI> 29.30. of the &s;econd of <HI>Gene&s;is.</HI> he giveth the&s;e things there for foode to all living Creatures. But the benediction which is expre&s;&s;ed, of fi&s;hes and of foules, is <HI>ver.</HI> 22. <HI>Encrea&s;e, and multiply, and reple|ni&s;h the waters, and the Earth,</HI> and to men he &s;aith, <HI>ver.</HI> 28. <HI>Encrea&s;e, and multiply, and repleni&s;h the Earth, and &s;ubdue it, and have dominion over the fi&s;h of the Sea, and over the foule of the ayre, and over every living thing that mooveth upon the Earth.</HI> The Earth then being prepared for generation, God &s;aid, <HI>Let the Earth put forth her bud, every hearbe producing &s;eede, according to its kinde,</HI> that is to &s;ay, from whence may grow the hearbe of the &s;ame &s;pecies, and every Tree bearing fruite, yeelding fruite according to its kind, who&s;e &s;eed is in it &s;elfe upon the Earth: that is, let it bring forth fruite wherein the &s;eede of the &s;ame &s;pecies may &s;pring in the meane time, while the tree groweth upon the Earth out of which another tree of the &s;ame &s;pecies may &s;pring. When he &s;aith, <HI>Let the Earth put forth her bud,</HI> it is certaine that the hearbe and the tree had not their perfection in the &s;ame in&s;tant that he &s;aid it, but both the one and the other, by the &s;pecificall Idea, and benediction of God, from one point, and at once (as it were) of the Earth; no otherwi&s;e then from a &s;eede (which being but &s;mall, hath yet all its vertue in the lea&s;t part, and bud thereof, which is contained and lyeth hid in one of the ends) commeth to burgeon, bud, and by little and little to grow into a great plant, or tree.</P>
<P>Now that we are come to the fir&s;t degree of life, it is nece&s;&s;ary fir&s;t to &s;earch dili|gently, and pro&s;ecute the nature and condition of the Spirituall &s;ub&s;tance, from whence life taketh its beginning. As I have &s;aid from the &s;ixth Chapter, that all things are come by evaporation, and exhalation from the Chaos: afterwards the elements being &s;o prepared for generation, and the cele&s;tiall things for influence, the omnipo|tent Creator tooke the Atomes of vertues, or the lea&s;t particles of the water and the earth, whereinto he put a &s;pecificall vertue according to the Idea's, and according to the number of the Idea's comprehended in his wi&s;edome, and withall added the be|nediction of engendring their like, to the end they might multiply the &s;ame &s;pecies, be|ing perpetually con&s;erved. But the &s;pirituall &s;ub&s;tance is the more noble part of ele|ment or generative body, which attracting nouri&s;hment, converting it into its nature, and protruding it forward to the increa&s;e and growth of the body, hath vertue from the benediction, and from nature. So the Earth, the water, the ayre, and other bo|dies, exhale from them&s;elves a &s;pirituall &s;ub&s;tance, by meanes of the heate, which by the &s;pecificall &s;ub&s;tance of the &s;eede is converted into the &s;ame nature and &s;pecies, and affordeth encrea&s;e, and growth, or motion, and &s;en&s;e, according to the conditi|on of the &s;pecies. The like &s;ub&s;tance when it is engendred in the bowels of the earth, and produceth its &s;pecies within the earth, doth not bring any encrea&s;e at all to the &s;pecies, but is coagulated, curdled, and bound together into it indi&s;&s;oluble, not po&s;&s;i|ble to be disjoyned from it: neither doth exhale otherwhere, diffu&s;ing its odour, or vertue, but onely by contraction and operation of the permanent quality. So Gold is coagulated and joyned together in the quality of the Spirituall &s;ub&s;tance, and re|ceiveth not encrea&s;e, but rather is contracted by the &s;ulphureous heate, that it may be made more ponderous, and weighty. Stones are in like manner engendred. Hearbes and trees, &s;eeing they are to grow and increa&s;e, have a more &s;oft nouri&s;hment, apt to extend: therefore al&s;o they exhale and yeeld odours and vertues, and at length by lit|tle and little are con&s;umed, being come by growth to maturity. This &s;pirituall &s;ub|&s;tance is that alone which pre&s;erveth its &s;pecies (I meane that which is in the plant, not that which is without) for this being fir&s;t attracted, and drawne from that, is chan|ged into the &s;pecies and afterward doth nouri&s;h it, and con&s;erve it: and doth nouri&s;h it &s;o long time, as there is nothing which corrupteth the &s;ame &s;pecies, con&s;erving al|wayes the &s;ame characteri&s;mes, and markes of leaves, of flowers, branches, and fruites; the odour, &s;avour, colour, and other accidents, &s;o firmely, that if but a little &s;lip, or bud, be graffed into another plant, there al&s;o will it follow its owne naturall property, changing all its nouri&s;hment into its owne &s;pecies. But all the nouri&s;hment
<PB N="37" REF="30">
&s;o attracted; is changed into the forme of that part whereunto it la&s;t commeth. So the juice of a tree being come to the fruite, is changed into the &s;pecies of fruite; being come to the leafe, is changed into the &s;pecies of the leafe. And the nouri&s;hment of the living Creature, when at la&s;t it is attracted to the liver, is converted into the li|ver, when to the rootes of any mu&s;ile, it pa&s;&s;eth into its &s;ub&s;tance, and &s;o of all o|thers: and every member draweth unto it &s;elfe, that which is mo&s;t fit for it &s;elfe. But &s;ome things which are unfit to nouri&s;h the body, nature expelleth, &s;ome into haire, &s;ome into nailes, &s;ome into &s;cabs, others otherwi&s;e: or quite out of the body. Some things which by a hidden vertue are appropriated to &s;ome part of the entrals, doe &s;trive thitherward by a naturall property. Therefore this &s;eminary and &s;pirituall &s;ub|&s;tance, is a thing very divine, wherein there is from the Creation all &s;pecificall facul|ty and vertue formative, wherein is &s;tirred up by meanes of the heart all motion of the body nece&s;&s;ary to the living Creature, that the vertue thereof might be &s;till ready to a&s;&s;i&s;t all the extreame parts of it: and doth afford like &s;eede for generation, that the continuation of the &s;ame &s;pecies may remaine to the end of all things. But wee mu&s;t know and con&s;ider this, that the &s;ame &s;pecies doth not come by influence from the &s;tarres, but from that into the which God fir&s;t put it, and whereunto he gave the benediction of generation: the Starres &s;urely are a helpe, but the originall and roote of all &s;pecies, is in the&s;e inferiour things. But &s;eeing that this world is (as it were) one body, having harmonious parts among them&s;elves, and con&s;piring together in one, as al&s;o all living creatures, to the image whereof, and of God, man (as a little world) was created, bearing the Image of God, and having like Oeconomy of parts; it is credible that the world hath al&s;o the Sunne for its heart, as the beginning of all life, and that it had its being from the beginning, when the light was created, and that it performeth the &s;ame office in the world, within the Concavity of the Firma|ment; that the heart doth in man, cheri&s;hing all things above, and below, by its heate and light, and that therefore it hath beene placed in the middle of the world, or a little higher, even as the heart in man.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="13" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. XIII. Of the Fabricke of the World. <HI>Of the Tree of Life.</HI></HEAD>
<P>_GOD hath given &s;uch a &s;eminary &s;pecies throughout the whole world, where the temperature of the element was proper thereunto, that the vertue of that &s;pecies was never anywhere wanting; for the Plants do not change their place, nor walke upon the earth like living creatures, but abiding in their place, doe there ca&s;t mature &s;eede: neither was care of tran&s;planting them impo&s;ed to man, as to whom all things nece&s;&s;arie pre&s;ented them|&s;elves voluntary and of their owne accord. And &s;eeing that the wi&s;edome of God hath created nothing in vaine, and without cau&s;e, which is not profitable to &s;ome nece&s;&s;itie of life, it was mo&s;t certaine that there is not any di&s;ea&s;e, nor defect of nature, for the which hee hath not provided a mo&s;t propitious remedy. Wherefore he hath cau&s;ed to bud and &s;pring &s;o many &s;pecies of Plants, as was needfull for the con&s;ervation and &s;u|&s;tentation of the life of man, and of all living creatures, and placed the tree of life in the mid&s;t of Paradi&s;e, to the end that man by the u&s;e thereof, might pre&s;erve his life in health, untill, being made more divine by the exerci&s;e and obedience of the comman|dement, he might be tran&s;lated into heaven.</P>
<P>So al&s;o the bruit living creatures &s;eeke &s;uccour for their nature: the Swallow, the Chelidony, the Catineppe, named the hearbe, from the Cat, the Toad, the Plantine, and Sage, the Dogge-gra&s;&s;e, called Dogges-tooth, the Tortei&s;e <HI>marioram,</HI> the Wee&s;ell rue, the Storke origan, the Partridge parierary, called al&s;o <HI>perdicium,</HI> the Hawke hierac, the Dove vermine, the Pye al&s;o being &s;icke, is &s;aid to carry baye leaves into her ne&s;t, that &s;he may cha&s;e away her &s;ickne&s;&s;e by them. So beleeve that the Harts have
<PB N="38" REF="31">
&s;hewed, that the hearbe <HI>dictamnum</HI> healeth them being wounded with arrowes, the weapon ejected by eating thereof, wee &s;uppo&s;e that the Hindes have demon&s;trated the hearbe called <HI>Sa&s;elis,</HI> and that the Serpents have made Fennell in high e&s;timation: for wee know that by the ta&s;ting and eating thereof, they have &s;tripped them&s;elves of old age, and by the juice thereof, regained the &s;harpene&s;&s;e of their &s;ight. Which al&s;o a man might &s;hew more at large, &s;eeing that bea&s;ts them&s;elves in&s;tructed by nature, have &s;hewed to mortall men the vertues of many hearbes knowne unto them. But hee hath created in every region &s;uch &s;pecies of Plants, as are mo&s;t agreeable in temperature to men, and living creatures there borne, which by experiments is often proved; &s;o that by the onely abundance of Plants which one &s;eeth &s;pring, a man may almo&s;t perceive to what popular (that is to &s;ay, ordinarily di&s;ea&s;es) every region is &s;ubject. So among the Danes, Fri&s;es, Hollanders, who are much &s;ubject to that di&s;ea&s;e, commonly called <HI>Scorbut,</HI> there is in abundance the hearbe called Cochlearia, as a proper medicine to that di&s;ea&s;e; &s;o in mari&s;h places. So the Tamariske acknowledgeth the native &s;oile: the inhabitants are expo&s;ed and &s;ubject to the indi&s;po&s;itions of the &s;pleene, as their pale colour &s;heweth, which is di&s;covered in their &s;welling skinne, and puffed up Hypo|chondries. In like manner is ob&s;erved that in tho&s;e quarters where Wormewood groweth about hedges, in courtyards, the inhabitants are ordinarily affected with the ob&s;tructions of their entrals, weakene&s;&s;e of the &s;tomacke, and &s;uffu&s;ion of the gall, that if the pa&s;&s;ages of the entrals be not opened by the u&s;e of the &s;aid herbe, and &s;trengthe|ned, and made firme by the evacuation of the gall, they come fir&s;t to have the Iaundi&s;e, and after, by little and little, endender water betwene the skinne and the fle&s;h. And although that &s;ome things are contrary and venimous to &s;ome, yet being u&s;ed in their kinde, they are healthfull; &s;o of the very wor&s;t poi&s;on, is made the noble treacle, and there is nothing created &s;o aver&s;e from the nature of man, the u&s;e whereof is not &s;ome way or other profitable. Now let us treate of the &s;eede. God created the hearbes and the plants of the Atomes of the earth, by the worke of the wi&s;edome, Idea, and benediction of God; but &s;o he created them as they now &s;pring of &s;eede, for there is the &s;ame operation of the fir&s;t generation, as of the &s;econd &s;eeing the &s;ame &s;pecies is, and remaineth.</P>
<P>As then out of the &s;eede groweth the plant, &s;o it is produced of the Atome of the earth, formed by the Idea into a certaine &s;pecies: and on the contrary. And from the &s;eed a little young bud, contained in one of the ends thereof: in what part it maketh the point of the &s;eede, it attracteth the humour of the Earth, or of the water, and formeth one little roote or more, according to the property of the &s;pecies, and the nouri&s;hment being attracted by them into the other end of the &s;eede produceth the trunke, and thereafter the branches and leaves, that adhere unto it. But the &s;pecifi|call vertue is in this little young bud, which changeth into its nature and &s;pecies, all the nouri&s;hment which it attracteth. The &s;ame rea&s;on is in the terre&s;triall Atome, for|med by the Idea, for it produceth its buds no otherwi&s;e then doth the &s;eede. Further|more, as this nouri&s;hment attracted, is carryed higher, &s;o is it more and more chan|ged into the forme of that which &s;pringeth from it, into branches divided from the truncke, into leaves, into flowers, and into fruites. The mo&s;t perfect of all is the fruite, wherein is perfectly accompli&s;hed the &s;eede which is given for the multipli|cation of the &s;pecies. And the higher things excied to encrea&s;e by the heate; doe at|tract juice from the inferiours, but the roote not able to admini&s;ter &s;ufficient nouri&s;h|ment to the higher, taketh new attractive rootes: whereby it gathereth nouri&s;h|ment more copiou&s;ly. Hence it followeth that tho&s;e plants which have more rootes&punc; their higher parts have neede of more nouri&s;hment, and their fruites are more moi&s;t, except the rootes be of greater u&s;e then their fruites: wherein the divine wi&s;edome hath provided for the u&s;e of the living Creatures, So the hearbes, the rootes where|of are ordayned to be eaten, attract more juice, and their rootes are more &s;ucculent, and more gro&s;&s;e: nature procuring encrea&s;e principally to rootes, and not to hearbes: tho&s;e that are more long, are ordinarily of a more dry and a more fat &s;ub&s;tance: as tho&s;e which &s;eeke a more dry nouri&s;hment at the bottome. From the accident, and pro|perties of rootes, many things may be ob&s;erved, which appertaine to the &s;earch of nature, and of tho&s;e hearbes. But in hearbes, the juice attracted is carryed upward by the parts not yet changed: but in trees, by the barke, as being more &s;pongious, till
<PB N="39" REF="31">
that (having &s;tayed there a certaine &s;pace of time) it be changed from the neerer part, and that which is mo&s;t noble, and more purified, is then carryed upward into flowers, into fruites, and for &s;eede. Many &s;peculations will pre&s;ent them&s;elves heere to one that will &s;earch after them. Now that the juice attracted is &s;o carryed upward, as I have &s;aid, the graffings of young &s;cienes in trees, teacheth us &s;ufficiently; for in them the humour attracted is fir&s;t communicated to the barke of the young &s;cienes, there &s;taying &s;ome &s;pace of time, doth unite the barkes of the young &s;cienes to the barkes of the &s;temmes, and after conjoyneth wood to wood: but the &s;pecies which is in the &s;temme, is changed into &s;pecies of the young &s;ciene, which is engraffed. So ac|cording to the commandement of God, the &s;ame &s;pecies produceth alwayes the &s;ame things, whether from the &s;eede, or from the young &s;ciene engraffed, and con&s;equent|ly bringeth forth branches, leaves, fruites, and &s;eed, according to the nature of the &s;pecies. It is not unprofitable al&s;o to con&s;ider, in how long time, and how long &s;pace from the earth, the fruit and the &s;eed come to their growth, and with what humours the plants are delighted above the rootes, and what they avoyd: and (if it be po&s;&s;ible) af|ter what manner the juice is changed through every degree, in the roote, in the trunck, in the leaves, in the flowers, in the fruite, and in the &s;eed: for &s;o the nature of the &s;pecies may be more exactly knowne. This at lea&s;twi&s;e is acknowledged, that the nouri&s;hment of the plant, is much more noble in the fruite, than in the plant: but mo&s;t noble in the &s;eed, as that which is the end and &s;cope of the Creation of all this &s;pecies.</P>
<P>Now by tho&s;e things we have already &s;aid, a man may gather, that divers hearbes and trees have beene created in divers regions, and experience teacheth, that there be &s;ome in America, or new India, which are found no where in this our continent, A&s;ia, Affrica, and Europe; which have not beene in the u&s;e of men untill &s;ome travelled thither, which I &s;uppo&s;e was after the time of Chri&s;t and his Apo&s;tles. In like manner there be there living Creatures, which are not at all found in our continent, which without doubt have beene there from the Creation of the world. Whereupon I pre|&s;ume that the&s;e lands were not overwhelmed with the Flood, when God would de|&s;troy mankind, <HI>Gen.</HI> 6. unto <HI>ver&s;.</HI> 7. For no men at all were there, and therefore the living Creatures there Created, and there inhabiting, ought not to be de&s;troyed, as man was to peri&s;h, whom it repented that he had Created, &s;eeing that in living crea|tures he found no cau&s;e wherefore they ought to be de&s;troyed, But in this our con|tinent the living creatures ought to peri&s;h; except &s;ome had beene pre&s;erved in the Arke, for they were not able to live in the waters.</P>
<P>When therefore God Created heere and there throughout the world the vertue of the tree of life, by one and the &s;ame meanes he provided, both for the one, and the o|ther e&s;tate of man; for that of innocency, and the other of &s;inne; and the vertue of the tree of life in paradi&s;e, or di&s;per&s;ed throughout the world was not for nought. For the world comming to be repleni&s;hed with men, all &s;hould have had acce&s;&s;e to the tree of life: but the hearbes and the plants growing heere and there; had beene equivalent and man had a certaine choi&s;e, and the benediction had diverted all &s;ick|ne&s;&s;e. Seeing then that they were mo&s;t wi&s;ely created for the u&s;e and &s;ervice of man, a&s;well in the &s;uperiour, as in the inferiour world, what a faire harmony was there then? when the lower things did accord with the highe&s;t, and expected helpe from them; and the highe&s;t communicated their gifts to the lowe&s;t, and all things &s;erved man, untill he &s;hould be tran&s;lated of God into his heavenly habitation. This corre&s;|pondency, this beauty of &s;tate had continued immutable if <HI>Adam</HI> had not &s;inned, yet this &s;ame harmony, if one con&s;ider it more diligently, is as yet di&s;covered in the traces of their fir&s;t nature, for there is nothing &s;o little which doth not &s;erve to &s;omething, and which doth not depend of one more perfect: all things are for man.</P>
<P>Seeing therefore all things tend to their end and &s;cope, and that &s;cope (that is to &s;ay man) con&s;i&s;teth of divers parts, which yet keepe among them&s;elves a mo&s;t agree|able harmony, as that wherein life con&s;i&s;teth: of tho&s;e &s;ome &s;erve to the &s;tomacke, &s;ome to the liver, &s;ome to the heart, &s;ome to the blood, &s;ome to the reynes, &amp;c. wherefore there are &s;o many &s;imples, or plants, as there be entrals in man, and af|fections of them. And &s;eeing that every thing changeth into its &s;pecies the nouri&s;h|ment
<PB N="40" REF="32">
that it attracteth, and that there are divers &s;tations in mans body, and divers wayes to every extreame &s;tation, by the which the nouri&s;hment pa&s;&s;eth, as in the ven|tricle, the liver, the blood, the &s;pleene &amp;c. tho&s;e &s;imples are &s;tronger, or pa&s;&s;e &s;oo|ner as friends by the middle &s;tations, which carry their vertue, entire even to the ex|treames, and there worke: and as for tho&s;e which cannot be there changed by nature, either they are venemous, or noy&s;ome to nature. Tho&s;e things which are changed in the fir&s;t &s;tations are friends to nature, or of &s;mall vertue. Tho&s;e which of an en|tire vertue penetrate, unto the extreame &s;tations, being friends to nature, are they which are more appropriate to that member, or to that part of the entrals, and have certaine characters, whereby they may be knowne, if a man take diligent heede. For we &s;ee that tho&s;e which re&s;emble nature, greatly communicate al&s;o in figure, as O|nyons, Garlike, and &s;uch like, have a forme of a &s;mall &s;callion for their roote, and produce almo&s;t alike hearbe upward, if their flowers differ in colour this com|meth to pa&s;&s;e by a certaine difference and peculiar property that is in them.</P>
<P>So there are many hearbes and trees which have dented leaves about like a Sawe, which for the &s;ame cau&s;e &s;o bud, and therefore they have &s;omething alike in nature, wherein they doe agree. Many hearbes al&s;o and plants have their leaves not dented about, but terminated equally; many that are dented, grow pointed, many round, as rue, many &s;harpe edged, hard, and pricking, as the yewe tree. All ought diligently to be ob&s;erved, for they are not &s;uch by ca&s;ualty, but by nature &s;o producing them perpetually: wherefore &s;eeing nature produceth nothing temerary, ra&s;hly, and the cau&s;e of the &s;ame figure is created to be perpetually the &s;ame, it is nece&s;&s;ary that many things, by a certaine law of &s;pecies, are alike, and have a certaine communion of na|ture. Moreover &s;eeing there is a con&s;piration, and &s;ociety both of cele&s;tiall and ter|re&s;triall things, tending to the &s;ame &s;cope and end, which is man: and the cele&s;tiall are eternall, and the &s;pecies al&s;o in this inferiour world are eternall, having alwayes the &s;ame generations in forme, and in figure, and depending every one of their pro|per cele&s;tiall cau&s;es; it is nece&s;&s;ary that taking heede to the characters of the plants, a man doe gather, and ob&s;erve many things which have re&s;pect to one and the &s;ame Starre, and many things al&s;o participating of the &s;ame nature (among the Phy&s;itians) in which things they have a mutuall corre&s;pondence, as in figure, colour, ta&s;te, and o|ther qualities: for &s;o, by the re&s;emblance, a man may learne to judge of the nature of things. For every nature hath its proper character, which it ever keepeth alike, na|ture in the Heavens communicating its vertue thereunto. The&s;e things according to my &s;peculation (&s;uch as it is) I was de&s;irous to admoni&s;h the Reader, that he might ad|vance by his &s;tudies, a thing above all other mo&s;t profitable, wherein <HI>Salomon</HI> obtai|ned much prai&s;e, 3 <HI>King.</HI> 4.33. For why may not a man &s;earch by &s;tudy and indu&s;try the things which are before his eyes, and follow perpetually in figure, and in forme, the &s;ame law of nature? It is a laborious worke indeed: but labour overcommeth all things.</P>
<P>I have heard the mo&s;t learned <HI>Reinerus Solinander,</HI> Phy&s;ition to the illu&s;trious Prince <HI>Iuliers,</HI> di&s;cour&s;ing mo&s;t accurately and pertinently touching the charecters of hearbes: who I would God he would proceede to take &s;ome paines in &s;o nece&s;&s;ary a part of Philo&s;ophie (if there be any able to doe it, it is he, being of that great dexte|ritie of judgement, in the &s;earching out of the nature, and cau&s;es of things) we &s;hould have in briefe the demon&s;trations of the characters, and hidden apparitions of them to every part of the entrals.</P>
<P>Therefore while God doth con&s;titute every where the vertues of the tree of life, the <HI>P&s;almi&s;t</HI> &s;aith well, <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 111.2. <HI>The workes of the Lord are great, &s;ought out of all them that have plea&s;ure therein:</HI> he doth alwayes direct to his &s;cope or end, the worke which he had preordained: be it that <HI>Adam</HI> obeyed the fir&s;t commandement, or not obeyed, and that in &s;overaigne wi&s;edome, mercy, goodne&s;&s;e, and ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>After that, according to my &s;mall under&s;tanding, I have treated of the nature and varietie of Plants, there is one &s;overaine miracle of nature very remarkeable; which is that &s;o many things which are in every &s;pecies, as for example, the greatne&s;&s;e, the forme, the figure, the odour, the ta&s;te, the colour, the leaves, the &s;inewes, the rootes, the barke, the vertue; and infinite things which are in one onely plant, are hidden in one &s;o &s;mall graine of &s;eede as I have &s;aid. For all the vertue of the &s;pecies is hid in one
<PB N="41" REF="32">
&s;o &s;mall a graine, when as that little graine hath nothing in it like unto all that, no not any appearance at all, but is wholly homogeneall, of the &s;ame kinde, and appeareth altogether of the &s;ame nature. Wherefore me thinkes I judge aright that the mo&s;t &s;imple Idea which in the beginning formed the &s;eede accompanieth as yet the &s;pecies, and continueth the &s;ame worke untill generation cea&s;e. And this is that which Chri&s;t &s;aith, <HI>Ioh.</HI> 5.17. <HI>My father worketh hitherto, and I al&s;o worke.</HI> Whence it appeareth that there be a Sabbath, or re&s;t from the creation, yet is it not from the &s;u&s;tentation of the Creatures, but that this worke endureth even to the end of all things: I doe not &s;ee what other thing can be here &s;aid.</P>
<P>He that is curious of this &s;peculation, let him con&s;ider chiefely what accidents are pro|per to every &s;pecies, and &s;earch out the cau&s;es of them if he can: in the fir&s;t place that he give good heede to the figure, and that he ob&s;erve by what order the growth there|of is made from the roote unto the top: in what manner al&s;o it doth proceede, and is di&s;tributed by the barke, by the veines, and by the &s;inewes, even to the compa&s;&s;e there|of, and &s;o at length without doubt, he &s;hall finde out the proper character of all na|ture: The end of the third Day.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XIIII. Of the Fabricke of the World. <HI>Of the Creation of the Lights.</HI> The fourth Day beginneth.</HEAD>
<P>_ALthough the creation of Lights was not perfectly fini&s;hed till the fourth Day, yet they begun to be created the fir&s;t Day, that is, evident, be|cau&s;e there is no other light that di&s;tingui&s;heth the day from the night, than that of the Sunne: as ver&s;e 14. that property is a&s;cribed unto it: and now three dayes are already pa&s;&s;ed, wherefore that light which di&s;tingui&s;hed the fir&s;t day from the night, without doubt was that light of the Sunne to come, di&s;per&s;ed as yet, but contracted into the Hemi&s;phere of heaven, environing the whole Chaos, and which from the beginning tur|ned upon the Poles of the world. So that the fir&s;t day, the heaven and the motion thereof, together with the light begun to be created. For in the fourth ver&s;e it is &s;aid, that God &s;eparated the light from the darkene&s;&s;e; which could not make the day and the night, but by the collection of the light into one part of heaven, and extending it to Paradi&s;e. Therefore, &s;eeing the day followeth the night, the creation of the light fell to be in that moitie, which was under the Horizon of Paradi&s;e, where becomming more &s;trong and more collected, by its motion towards the We&s;t, a&s;cen|ded from the orientall part of Paradi&s;e above the Horizon thereof, and made the Day. But the collection of the &s;ub&s;tance of the Sunne, of the Moone, and of the Starres, was not perfectly fini&s;hed, till the fourth day; for <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> de&s;cribeth the time when the workes were fully fini&s;hed, which dependeth, and is defined from the perpetuall Will of God. Yet the Sunne (which I have &s;aid before, Chapter the twelfth, to be the heart of the world, even as the heart is in living creatures) ought to have beene created before all things: therefore he begun with the fir&s;t Creation of the light. But the Sunne having received a mo&s;t cleare, and lucide &s;ub&s;tance, obtained the dominion and rule of the day; the Moone of the night, as not illuminating the night by its owne light, but very little, yea in the whole Ecclip&s;e thereof when the aire is cleare, yet ap|peareth the circle of it, but the light very &s;mall. But the Starres and con&s;tellations, &s;eeme to have a &s;tronger light, but farre inferiour to that of the Sunne.</P>
<P>That is to be ob&s;erved which he &s;aith, that the lights were placed in the firmament of heaven: and ver&s;e 8. <HI>He calleth the firmament heaven,</HI> whence a man may gather, that the Chaos was created much le&s;&s;e than the world now is, and from <HI>Aphar,</HI> and (as it were) a &s;limie Aby&s;&s;e of the Chaos, the matter being educted and extenuated,

was elevated upward, and by little and little, as it departed farther from the Center, being made more and more &s;ubtile and noble, as it extended it &s;elfe, begirded and com|po&s;ed the more gro&s;&s;e Elements. And &s;o the Empyriall heaven was made the mo&s;t &s;ub|tile and noble, as being the throne of God, and the habitation of the ble&s;&s;ed. Vnder that the <HI>Primum mobile,</HI> the fir&s;t moveable, a heaven a little more gro&s;&s;e, and le&s;&s;e noble. Vnder that the other Heavens and Planets, which by how much nearer they are to the earth, by &s;o much they are of a more gro&s;&s;e and le&s;&s;e noble &s;ub&s;tance, le&s;&s;e extended. So that the heaven of the Moone is the mo&s;t gro&s;&s;e, and next in condition to the elements. This expan&s;ion or entending, maketh the &s;uperiour things lighter, and the &s;eparation of them from tho&s;e that are more gro&s;&s;e; maketh them more noble. Moreover, the luminous matter which was prepared for the &s;ub&s;tance of the Starres and lights, was not extended, but contracted, that they might &s;hine more &s;trongly, and become more con&s;picuous. So it commeth that the Starres are of a thicker &s;ub&s;tance than the re&s;t of the heaven, yet equally light, becau&s;e it is fie|rie, and al&s;o thicker, that the light might be the more &s;trong and powerfull, and the reflexion of the beames; ca&s;t from the other Starres, which doth illuminate the night: e&s;pecially that which is reflected from the Moone; but that light which is di|rected from the Sunne, doth divide the day from the night.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the&s;e offices of the two lights, it is added, that they may be for &s;ignes, and for &s;ea&s;ons, and for dayes, and for yeares. Here the A&s;tronomers by &s;ignes under&s;tand certaine a&s;pects of the Starres, whereby things to come are betokened: but they erre greatly, for that wherefore the lights were created, is of farre greater moment than the divers divinations of the A&s;trologers, to wit, that men, whom God had lodged in this edifice, might learne to know the omnipotencie and goodne&s;&s;e of their Creator, which <HI>David</HI> &s;heweth very clearely, <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 19.1. <HI>The heavens declare the glory of God, and the firmament &s;heweth his handie worke.</HI> And Saint <HI>Paul, Rom.</HI> 1.19. That which may be knowne of God is manife&s;t in them, for God hath &s;hewed it unto them: for the in|vi&s;ible things of him, from the creation of the world are clearely &s;eene, being under|&s;tood by the things that are made, even his eternall power and God-head. The&s;e two lights therefore are for this cau&s;e chiefely &s;et in heaven, that by the&s;e workes of God, the omnipotency, maje&s;tie and divinitie of the Creator might be made knowne unto men, and not to the intent they &s;hould &s;erve for the vanitie of A&s;trologers. Moreover, they are given for the de&s;ignation of times, when they are to be changed. So they will demon&s;trate the end of times, and judgment of the world, when they &s;hall be ob&s;cu|red, and de&s;olved. So at the time of the pa&s;&s;ion of Chri&s;t, when the time of the Law was to be changed, <HI>Diony&s;ius</HI> the Areopagite &s;aw the admirable ecclip&s;e of the Sunne. And <HI>Io&s;hua</HI> perceived the admirable hand of God by the Sunne, <HI>Jo&s;h.</HI> 10.13. They are al&s;o &s;et to define the dayes and the yeares. The Starres al&s;o, which by night adorne the heaven above, doe al&s;o illuminate the earth below, and by their po&s;ition &s;hew the annuall circuit of the Sunne. The end of the fourth Day.</P>

<P>_THE &s;econd degree of things having beene treated of, now is handled the third, concerning things which are, which have vegetation and motion: and fir&s;t of tho&s;e which come from the waters, which are of a le&s;&s;e &s;olid &s;ub&s;tance, doe more ea&s;ily encrea&s;e, and are not &s;o long lived, which are divided into many &s;pecies, and every one of them en|gender among them&s;elves the &s;eede of their &s;pecies from the which &s;pecies comming to maturitie, and di&s;per&s;ed, the &s;ame &s;pecies groweth: but the in|dividuals

of every Species, have alwayes the &s;ame characters or markes. So that there is alwayes the &s;ame number and figure of the bones, the &s;ame colour, the &s;ame forme of body and of other members, the &s;ame force, nature and &s;avour, as al&s;o in hearbes and in plants, but divers &s;pecies have al&s;o divers impre&s;&s;ions of characters; differing in figure, or &s;ome accident: of which difference, if thou can&s;t gather the cau&s;e, thou may&s;t contemplate more nearely the proper nature of every &s;pecies. For the proper nature of every &s;pecies maketh different impre&s;&s;ions of the Characters, and this doth follow the other as from the effect a man may gather the cau&s;e, and from the cau&s;e, the nature. In the contemplation of foules, the &s;ame things offer them&s;elves to be con&s;idered. But becau&s;e that the &s;ub&s;tance of foules is more &s;olid, and con&s;equently longer lived, therefore al&s;o the workeman&s;hip of them was later fini&s;hed this day: although they begunne to be formed together, when the waters were gathered into the Seas. For the matter of every thing being prepared, inconti|nent the Creation proceeded, and cea&s;ed not till all things were fully fini&s;hed, and the Sabbath, or re&s;t from all the worke of the Creation was come. For there is no cau&s;e wherefore the matter being once prepared, the Creation of things &s;hould be &s;u&s;pended. God Created many things as well as one, and the naturall order of crea|ting things, is elegantly ob&s;erved. The Starres al&s;o, which &s;erved more neerely un|to life, were now al&s;o the precedent fourth day perfectly fini&s;hed, that they might the more powerfully conferre their aid, than when the hearbes were created. So the nature of things Created, &s;o &s;oone as it was prepared, began to exerci&s;e its office, and all things co-operating together, the Fabricke of the world went forward. Oh ad|mirable wi&s;edome! which &s;ufficed for the creating of the order, the nature, the or|nament, the perfection, and the vertues of &s;o many different things, and all with|out &s;tudy or rea&s;oning! for he &s;peaketh the word, and they were made. It &s;hall be good heere to make an anatomy of every one of the &s;pecies, that it may be knowne in what things the impre&s;&s;ions of the characters of every one are different, and in what manner, and by how many &s;tations the nouri&s;hment is changed into the &s;pecies, in what &s;tation the blood is created in fi&s;hes. Thou &s;halt find al&s;o in fi&s;hes, by the ad|mirable providence, a little bladder full of aire inclo&s;ed in it, which taketh encrea&s;e together with the fi&s;h, who&s;e office is to &s;u&s;taine it pendant, in what part of the wa|ter &s;oever it be, lea&s;t by the weight of the body it &s;inke to the bottome. Thou &s;halt find al&s;o in females many egges, which being broken again&s;t the rockes, or other|wi&s;e by the vertue of nature forced out, come to multiply their &s;pecies, and even as the &s;eede of the plant, being ca&s;t beyond its mother (&s;eing it hath a &s;pecificall vertue in it &s;elfe) produceth the &s;ame &s;pecies in its element: be it in the Earth or in the wa|ter. So al&s;o the&s;e egges of fi&s;hes being ca&s;t into the water, there receive life, and &s;hew the &s;ame &s;pecies, and the &s;ame character of their mother. Neither &s;hall it be unprofitable al&s;o to rip up the &s;everall &s;pecies of birds, and to con&s;ider their inferiour parts, and the functions of every one of them, that the cau&s;es of the impre&s;&s;ions of the characters, and the originall of their proper nature may more rightly be knowne. In the which are procreated egges one at a time, and are excluded, having for there coverture a &s;hell &s;omewhat hard, lea&s;t the &s;pecificall vertue &s;hould more ea&s;ily come to exhale: the which al&s;o being &s;eparated from their mother, keepe their &s;pecificall vertue, and being hatched by the heate of the mother, or al&s;o by &s;toves, as is u&s;ed in Egypt for the &s;pace of &s;ixe moneths, or a moneth produce birds of the &s;ame &s;pecies. Moreover, they are conceived by the copulation of the Male and Female, as other li|ving Creatures. But heere heede is to be taken principally to the difference of fi&s;h, and of foules, that though they were perfectly fini&s;hed in one and the &s;ame day, yet doe they not con&s;i&s;t of the &s;ame matter: but foules becau&s;e they re&s;emble more terre&s;tri|all living Creatures, as is manife&s;ted by the blood, and by the whole con&s;titution of their body, they have more terre&s;triall &s;ub&s;tance than fi&s;hes, that they &s;eeme to come of muddy water, and fi&s;hes of more pure water. Foules therefore are of a middle rancke betweene terre&s;triall living Creatures, and fi&s;hes; nearer to the nature of ter|re&s;triall living Creatures, than of fi&s;hes: and therefore later this day fini&s;hed. But there is one thing mo&s;t worthy to be ob&s;erved in all living Creatures, that is, that they doe imitate in &s;ome &s;ort the &s;hape of man; whole nature (as it were) tending to the forming of man, and not having its entire perfection but in man, for although

<P>_WEE have &s;eene two &s;orts of the third degre&euml; of things created, Fi&s;hes and Foules; now followeth the third kinde, terre&s;triall living Crea|tures, which how much the later they were created, &s;o much the li|ker are they unto man, both in &s;en&s;e and motion; but in rea&s;on man &s;urpa&s;&s;eth them all, they being de&s;titute heereof. But of terre&s;triall living Creatures &s;ome are more like man then others, as they write of the Elephant, that it is a docible bea&s;t, and commeth neere to man in under&s;tanding; What &s;hall we &s;ay of the Ape, which &s;porting imitateth mans actions? is angry, laugheth, applaudeth, &s;eriou&s;ly &s;melleth, warily beholdeth a thing, as deliberating whether it be good to eate; crackes nuts with her teeth like a man, and while &s;he is bu&s;ie about her owne worke, lookes upon the by-&s;tanders what they doe: &s;he hath head, feete, and hands very like tho&s;e of man, and in all things, is that among&s;t living Creatures, which commeth neere&s;t the characters, and nature of man. For this cau&s;e it were not ami&s;&s;e diligently to con&s;ider the anatomy of this Creature, and to examine how much and in what, the interiour di&s;po&s;ition thereof differeth from that of man; that the animall vertues may be knowne by the inward impre&s;&s;ions. For I thinke that tho&s;e depend upon the&s;e, or being after a &s;peciall manner engraffed by nature, are by impre&s;&s;ion of the character, as by a fit in&s;trument &s;tirred up unto action, which yet &s;eemeth ambiguous and doubtfull. For it appeareth that every thing hath in it &s;elfe a certaine principle of its owne nature, which dyeth with it, &s;o that the cau&s;e of the nature of every thing is created together with it, and is not from el&s;ewhere. But we mu&s;t anatomize every &s;pecies, that the inward difference of all living Creatures a|mong&s;t them&s;elves, may be perceived, and the difference of the animall vertues may appeare, from the diver&s;ity of the impre&s;&s;ions of their characters, &s;o &s;hall you finde out, for what rea&s;ons, the vertues animall are more excellent in foules, than in fi&s;hes, in bea&s;ts than in foules, in men than in bea&s;ts, and under&s;tand a mo&s;t excellent order, from things le&s;&s;e &s;olid; from the le&s;&s;e perfect, to the more perfect, from the le&s;&s;e lively, to the more lively; from things temporall to tho&s;e eternall.</P>
<P>All living creatures are nouri&s;hed of &s;uch things as the earth bringeth forth, every one choo&s;ing naturally what be&s;t agreeth with his owne nature, and this is profita|ble to be knowne. For although the nature of every one changeth his nouri&s;hment into his &s;pecies, yet is there &s;ome vertue in hearbes, and fruites, which turneth and altereth the &s;aid aliment into their owne nature, e&s;pecially where there is affinity of natures, and ea&s;ie dige&s;tion, yea they can al&s;o change venime, and corrupt it: but by the force of a contrary nature. Birds al&s;o feed on fi&s;hes, as being in kind nearer them, and every thing delighteth in that which comes nearer the nature thereof, ex|cept that which is of the &s;ame &s;pecies, which every living Creature loveth, man one|ly excepted, who hath forgot his originall. Venimous bea&s;ts, be&s;ides their nature good for &s;omething, have this commodity, that they every where &s;ucke up the vemine, and are nouri&s;hed with it, but other bea&s;ts devoure them without harme, &s;o well hath nature provided for the &s;afety of living Creatures. But heere remaineth one que&s;tion to be an&s;wered: whether that the &s;ame condition of living creatures which

And to what end &s;hould they have beene immortall, when they were onely ordained for the &s;ervice of man? &s;eeing &s;uch infinite encrea&s;e &s;hould have beene for no u&s;e: They had reveren|ced man undoubtedly, and beene obedient to him, for God, <HI>Gen.</HI> 1.28, 29, 30. made <HI>Adam</HI> Lord of all things under Heaven.

<P>_THE fourth degree of things created, and the mo&s;t perfect is man, for u&s;e and &s;ervice all things were hitherto created, and as all tho&s;e things a|mong them&s;elves have a kinde of order, and harmonie, for their mu|tuall a&s;&s;i&s;tance; &s;o all the&s;e together have a certaine conformitie, and harmonie unto man, in nature, qualitie, and operations, and therefore man is of the Greekes called the little world. But this conformitie, and hermonie, is &s;o farre as concerneth the animall part of man.</P>
<P>Furthermore, there is a thing farre more noble in man, that hee exce&euml;deth the dig|nitie of all creatures, to wit, the rea&s;onable &s;oule, according to which he was created after the Image and the &s;imilitude of God. And becau&s;e man, according to his &s;ub|&s;tance is a rea&s;onable creature, and received a ble&s;&s;ing that he &s;hould encrea&s;e and multiply by the generation of his &s;pecies: there is no doubt but from that ble&s;&s;ing, he hath al&s;o received power to beget a rea&s;onable &s;oule, which is the chiefe part of the &s;pecies. Which that it &s;hould be new created in every man, is not agreeable, &s;eeing God the &s;eventh day cea&s;ed from all the workes of his Creation, and then kept the Sabbath.</P>
<P>And there are yet in this inferiour world, the reliques of that matter, of which the cele&s;tiall and &s;upercele&s;tiall things were created, &s;o that there is a naturall inclination, and &s;ympathie, of the &s;uperiour world, unto the inferiour, and a re&s;pect and de&s;ire of the inferiour unto the &s;uperiour. For from hence al&s;o dependeth the proclivitie and cooperation of things &s;uperiour, unto the inferiour. The thing mo&s;t noble, that is in the higher world, is the Empyriall heaven, or tho&s;e &s;upercele&s;tiall waters, out of which I have &s;hewed the Angels to be created. So that the rea&s;onable &s;oule may be be|got of the reliques thereof, in this inferiour world: and why may it not, &s;eeing gold which is corruptible, is begot of the farre more gro&s;&s;e and ignoble matter of the earth? Therefore the eternall and immortall &s;oule, may much rather be begot of the reliques of the &s;upercele&s;tiall waters, that it may be like unto Angels, and the ble&s;&s;ing and commandement of God gave power to beget the &s;oule of &s;uch reliques, to pro|pagate and multiply the &s;pecies. Now &s;ee what gifts of the holy Gho&s;t or God are in his &s;oule. Here are under&s;tanding, rea&s;on, judgement, memory, love of what is true|ly good, ju&s;tice, joy in the holy Gho&s;t, free election of will, and what el&s;e. For in the&s;e things he beareth the re&s;emblance of God and his Image, in the immortall &s;ub|&s;tance of the rea&s;onable &s;oule. For man was created in this order and manner, fir&s;t he formed the humane &s;hape of <HI>Aphar,</HI> or clay, in which undoubtedly tho&s;e bowels which are fir&s;t made in generation begun to be formed, as the heart, then the liver and tho&s;e things which depend immediately upon the heart: Which being formed he breathed into his face the breath of life. All living things draw breath through the mouth and no&s;trils, whereby the heart is kindled with life and motion; &s;o through the mouth and no&s;trils he breathed &s;pirit, which was without que&s;tion of the reliques of the &s;upercele&s;tiall waters; or &s;ome part of them was fir&s;t conceived in the ma&s;&s;e or lumpe
<PB N="46" REF="35">
of the body, of which the rea&s;onable &s;oule by the holy Gho&s;t accompanying it, was at length formed: but fir&s;t the animall life was produced by the common aire. For the rea&s;onable &s;oule; &s;eeing they have different offices the one from the other: and the animall &s;oule going before, the rationall remaineth, and the animall &s;oule is a certaine harmonie, and common operation of the interiour entrals, con&s;piring to the life of the animall; as for the rationall, it is the Image of the divine e&s;&s;ence. But that the animals have obtained life, it commeth to pa&s;&s;e undoubtedly by the Spirit of God working with the like bla&s;t of aire; although it be not &s;aid &s;o, for it is ea&s;ily under&s;tood, that in like things God hath wrought after a like manner. The gifts which the rea&s;onable &s;oule, brought with it, were nece&s;&s;ary in man, if he ought to be the Image of God; that he might contemplate the workes of God, and might acknowledge, adore and wor&s;hip his Creator. For the knowledge of God was required unto the &s;cope of the creation of man; for what ble&s;&s;edne&s;&s;e had he had with God, without the knowledge of him? Seeing therefore he knew the chiefe power and goodne&s;&s;e of God, and that the con|templation and familiarity of God was plea&s;ant to him, God would trie him, whe|ther he that was enriched by him with greate&s;t gifts, whereby he could obey God, would acknowledge and reverence God his Creator: for &s;o bountifull a father requi|red voluntary and willing obedience and love, whereby to be wor&s;hipped, and con|digne &s;ervice received from him. He gave him an ea&s;ie command, that he &s;hould not eate of one tree, where there were &s;o many full of the be&s;t fruits, for &s;ight and ta&s;te, that hee &s;hould onely ab&s;taine from that, and it is credible, that he obeyed God a|while, for as many thinke, he remained not in Paradi&s;e one houre, or &s;ome dayes or weekes.</P>
<P>It is likely rather that he remained &s;ome yeares in the obedience of God, as <HI>George Cedrenus</HI> thinketh, that being &s;ollidly taught the workes of God, by the helpe of the holy Gho&s;t, and longer contemplation, he might declare them to his po&s;teritie: And &s;eeing men then lived long, the true doctrine of God, by the tradition of a few, to wit, three (<HI>Adam, Methu&s;alem,</HI> and <HI>Noah</HI>) came to <HI>Abraham,</HI> by who&s;e holy covenant with God, it was ea&s;ily pre&s;erved in the po&s;teritie of <HI>Iacob,</HI> even unto <HI>Mo&s;es.</HI> But ido|latrie too much prevailing about the time of his birth, God would by the de&s;cription of the chiefe of his workes by <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> reduce men to the acknowledgement and wor|&s;hip of one onely God. Here then is propounded to our contemplation, the generation of the world, which he de&s;cribed partly by tradition, and partly by the revelation of the holy Gho&s;t; whereby we may attaine the true and perfect de&s;cription of the whole world which we &s;eeke for. He had without doubt frequent talke with God, where|in he was taught concerning the creation, the nature of things, Gods coun&s;ell, and o|ther things, which were nece&s;&s;arie for man to know. God brought to him the living creatures, that he might behold them every one, and give them names according to ther nature; which could not be done in a &s;mall &s;pace of time. <HI>George Cedrenus</HI> in the abridgement of Hi&s;tories, &s;aith, &s;ome ancients were of opinion, that <HI>Adam</HI> &s;inned not, nor was ca&s;t out of Paradi&s;e, untill the &s;eventh yeare, and makes it probable by good rea&s;ons.</P>

<P>_IN the meane time whil&s;t <HI>Adam</HI> dwelt in Paradi&s;e, being made more fami|liar with God, perhaps not &s;eriou&s;ly con&s;idering Gods command, he lent his eares unto Sathan, &amp; heard him long with patience, who being become Gods enemie, becau&s;e by his ju&s;t judgement, he was ca&s;t out of heaven, laid waite for man, per&s;waded him that Gods commandement was gi|ven him for &s;ome other end, than he had heard from God, when neverthele&s;&s;e hee knew that God his Creator was true and ju&s;t, and had not given his commandement
<PB N="47" REF="35">
in vaine, but that the Serpent was a lier, and ju&s;tly throwne downe from heaven. For it is not to be doubted, but that he had much conver&s;ation with God in Paradi&s;e, and divers di&s;cour&s;es whereby he was in&s;trctued concerning the Creation, and nature, and the end of all things. Yea acknowledged the power of God from &s;o wi&s;e a Creation, and the right judgement given again&s;t the Serpent, that of right he &s;hould not have given eare to the Serpent, and that it was folly for him &s;o to doe: neverthe|le&s;&s;e in this he did not &s;inne again&s;t God, becau&s;e God had not forbidden it. For it made for the greater glory of God, if <HI>Adam</HI> had not &s;inned: for then had man given a certaine te&s;timonie of him&s;elfe, that he was well created, as all things were very good, <HI>Gen.</HI> 1.31. He could have interrupted the &s;erpents &s;peech, and rejected him, and he had not &s;inned. It was the beginning of &s;inne, but it was not &s;inne that he gave eare to Sathan, for God had not forbidden this, and as yet he had power to contradict him: but his longer patience and familiarity cau&s;ed con&s;ent, and he forthwith &s;inned by tran&s;gre&s;&s;ing the commandement, wherewith the holy Gho&s;t offended, left him, and &s;poiled him of his gifts, which he had received in the Creation, and were pre&s;er|ved in him by the holy Gho&s;t, &s;o long as he did not &s;inne, God con&s;idering the event, but not approving it, becau&s;e he had forbidden it, and <HI>Adam</HI> &s;o making experiment of his con&s;tancie. Of this lap&s;e <HI>Eccle&s;ia&s;ticus</HI> writeth mo&s;t plainely, and mo&s;t truely, <HI>Chap.</HI> 15. <HI>ver&s;e</HI> 14. God created man from the beginning, and left him in the hand of his coun&s;ell, giving him the&s;e ordinances and commandements, if thou wilt thou &s;halt keepe the commandements, and te&s;tifie thy good will. He hath &s;et before thee fire and water, put forth thy hand to which thou wilt. Life and death are offered unto man, good and evill, which he plea&s;es &s;hall be given unto him. But now, &s;ince God knew before that he would &s;inne, why did he not create him &s;uch a one, as could not fall? God did all things well and like a father. It was his favour that man was adorned with &s;uch excellent gifts of minde, that he might ea&s;ily obey &s;o &s;mall a commande|ment, and man of right ought to have beene thankefull for &s;o great gifts by obeying his Creator. He could therefore as <HI>Eccle&s;ia&s;ticus</HI> &s;aith, have &s;tood if he would, but that he fell it was not of God prede&s;tinating or willing, for God had created all things very good, and Fatherly ordred them. So when he &s;inned, he was deprived of the holy Gho&s;t, which dwelt before familiarly with him, from whom he had life not mortall, if he had not &s;inned, who had &s;u&s;tained him in holy life by the grace and fa|vour of God: being de&s;titute therefore of the familiar pre&s;ence of the Spirit of God, he perceived nothing in him&s;elfe but carnall affections, whereby his minde being drawne away, (as is evident by <HI>Paul, Rom.</HI> 7.15. and the <HI>ver&s;e</HI> following, and 24.) he al&s;o was made carnall, that is, addicted to the concupi&s;cence of the fle&s;h, as being con&s;tituted in the &s;ame &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, for he &s;aith, there is another law and nece&s;&s;itie in the fle&s;h, than in the &s;pirit or under&s;tanding; and that it draweth the &s;pirit captive in|to &s;ervitude. And that which is captive, is not in its owne power, but is &s;ubjected to the power of another. He &s;heweth then that the &s;pirit in the beginning was not car|nall but became &s;uch when it was made captive to the fle&s;h. It is altogether nece&s;&s;a|rie to know, and ob&s;erve this originall of originall &s;inne, that the &s;pirit from the be|ginning was not created carnall, or fraile, or unable to re&s;i&s;t evils, for this would ar|gue the impotencie of the Creator, that he could not create man fit for that end which he had conceived, and would violate his authority. Now what calamities are accrew|ed unto mankinde from this &s;inne, learne from that place of Saint <HI>Paul, Chap.</HI> 7. for if the fle&s;h could doe &s;o much again&s;t the Spirit, adorned with &s;o many abilities, and pre&s;erved by the holy Gho&s;t, what &s;hall it not doe again&s;t the &s;ame &s;pirit made cap|tive thereunto, and for&s;aken of the familiaritie of the holy Gho&s;t. Heare what the Apo&s;tle &s;aith, <HI>Rom.</HI> 3.12. of all, both Iewes and Gentiles, <HI>They have all gone out of the way, they are all become unprofitable, there is none that doth good, no not one.</HI> He &s;peakes of mans natures alone, but when it is Chri&s;t, and man is helped of the holy Gho&s;t, he is not &s;uch, the naturall gifts of the minde, under&s;tanding, rea&s;on, judgement, memory, and other gifts &s;uffice not, if the &s;pirit be not pre&s;ent, the &s;upporter and go|vernour of the&s;e. But the concupi&s;cence of the fle&s;h is not onely a privation of righ|teou&s;ne&s;&s;e, but a true inclination to tho&s;e things which plea&s;e the fle&s;h, from whence all &s;innes ari&s;e, and therefore that inclination is called originall &s;inne. Now if it were onely a privation of righteou&s;ne&s;&s;e, <HI>Paul</HI> had no occa&s;ion to exclaime: <HI>Wretched man

that I am who &s;hall deliver me from the body of this death? Rom.</HI> 7. For a regenerate man is freed from his minde. But in the regenerate &s;inne originall yet abideth, which is an argument, that originall &s;inne is more then a privation, and an evill which clea|veth to nature, and is propagated by generation. <HI>In &s;inne</HI> (&s;aith the <HI>P&s;almi&s;t) my mo|ther conceived me.</HI> But God fore&s;eeing that this &s;inne would come upon man, &s;aid, <HI>In that day in which thou &s;halt eate of the tree of the knowledge of good and evill, thou &s;halt die the death;</HI> for this &s;inne was to be expiated with the death of the body.

<P>_BEcau&s;e God fore&s;aw that Man would &s;inne, le&s;t &s;o wi&s;e a Creation of all things, and the end whereunto it was ordained &s;hould be in vaine, which <HI>Adam</HI> violated by &s;inning, it plea&s;ed him therefore to repaire the fall of man, by a new benefit, ordayning a meanes whereby being delivered, he might be re&s;tored to his former condition, and that the intent of his fir&s;t Creation might take effect, he promi&s;ed his Sonne &s;hould take fle&s;h upon him, who &s;hould &s;atisfie for the &s;inne of <HI>Adam,</HI> with which all men were taynted from their birth, that he &s;hould appea&s;e God the Father, and obtaine the helpe of the Holy Gho&s;t againe, which being promi&s;ed, and beleeved, they might by the &s;ame inten|tion, as before attaine to eternall life. From this foreknowledge, God u&s;ing his won|derfull providence, &s;o fini&s;hed the Creation of all thing, that in both e&s;tates, of o|bedience, and the fall, he pre&s;erved for man the meanes to obtaine eternall life, &s;o that nothing was made of God in vaine, onely the death of the fle&s;h remayned, which was due to originall &s;inne, untill that was taken away from man altogether, and he being wholly pure, as he was Created, might come to God, according to the end wherefore he was Created.</P>
<P>Moreover, becau&s;e all men were guilty of orignall &s;inne, as I &s;hewed in the for|mer Chapter, &s;o that they could not by the gifts of nature, come unto Chri&s;t, God therefore ordayned Repentance, Bapti&s;me, and Communion, the chiefe Sacraments, whereby man before all the world, might yeeld him&s;elfe unto Chri&s;t, and by faith might approove and accept his &s;acrifice for the &s;innes of man, whereby he might be armed again&s;t the force of &s;inne, be delivered by this onely meanes, from the power of originall &s;inne, and obtaine the helpe of the Holy Gho&s;t again&s;t the force there|of, yet the fight with &s;inne remaineth &s;o long as wee live, till it be aboli&s;hed by the death of the fle&s;h, on which the originall thereof dependeth, and therefore the death of the fle&s;h was enjoyned of God, becau&s;e of the fall of <HI>Adam,</HI> that that &s;inne which is be&s;ides the Creation, might be rooted out: by meanes whereof, man is &s;aved, yet is there no acce&s;&s;e unto God the Father, but by Chri&s;t.

That therefore I may adde that which of many is not rightly di&s;puted, before the incarnation of Chri&s;t, none of the holy Fathers a&s;cended into Heaven, but were re&s;erved in a certaine place of joy and happy expectation, untill the comming of Chri&s;t. This place, the Fathers called <HI>Limbus,</HI> not that of Hell, but as I &s;uppo&s;e, that of the Heavenly Paradi&s;e, in which <HI>Abraham,</HI> as Father of the faith|full, was mo&s;t eminent, into who&s;e bo&s;ome or Congregation <HI>Lazarus</HI> after his death was carryed by the Angels.

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. I.</HI> What Geographie, the Globe, or the round earth is.</HEAD>
<P>_GEography is a di&s;cription of the whole Earth, as much as is di&s;covered to us. This Greeke word Geography, is com|pounded of the Noune <GAP DESC="foreign">, or <GAP DESC="foreign">, in&s;tead whereof this word <GAP DESC="foreign"> is u&s;ed in compo&s;ition, that is to &s;ay, Earth, and of the verbe <GAP DESC="foreign">, I write, whence is made this com|pound word <GAP DESC="foreign">, that is to &s;ay, a di&s;cription of the Earth.</P>
<P>Geography is differing from Co&s;mography, as the part from the whole, and is al&s;o di&s;tingui&s;hed from Chorogra|phie, as the whole from the part: for Co&s;mographie is the di&s;cription of all the World, which is derived from the Greeke Noune <GAP DESC="foreign">, that is to &s;ay World, and from the verbe <GAP DESC="foreign">, that is to &s;ay, I write, when one &s;peakes of the whole world, we under&s;tand the world, as well elementary, as Ce|le&s;tiall.</P>
<P>Corography is the particular de&s;cription of &s;ome Region, or Country, and commeth al&s;o from this Greeke word <GAP DESC="foreign">, or <GAP DESC="foreign">, that is to &s;ay, Region, and from the verbe <GAP DESC="foreign">, which is to &s;ay, I write, as the di&s;cription of <HI>Spaine, Italy, Germany, France; &amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>Topographie is the particular de&s;cription of a certaine place, as of a Countrey, of a Territory, or of a Towne, or of a village, under which are compri&s;ed Manured Land, Medowes, Trees, Places and buildings, repre&s;ented by writing. This is al&s;o a Greeke word, and compounded of the Noune <GAP DESC="foreign">, that is to &s;ay, a place, and of the verbe <GAP DESC="foreign">, that is to &s;ay, I write.</P>
<P>But Geographie is properly the de&s;cription of the &s;ituation of the Earth alone, where in fir&s;t is to be marked, that in the terme of Geographie, this word is not onely taken for one of the foure elements, as in a Phy&s;icall terme, but thereby we under&s;tand con|joyntly, the earth moi&s;tened with the waters, which are &s;howred upon it, making both together the Center of the whole world, which becau&s;e of the round figure is cal|led <HI>Orbis,</HI> or the Globe of the Earth. For the Globe is a &s;olid body round on all &s;ides, contained in a Superficies, having in the middle thereof a Center or point, whereof all lines which are drawne from thence, unto the &s;uperficies, are equall: this then is a &s;ole Globe, compounded of the one and the other Element, from whence rebounds one onely convex or Superficies, that is to &s;ay, which appeareth without concavity.</P>
<P>The Geographers di&s;tingui&s;h diver&s;ly the Globe of the Earth, into certaine Circles and parts whereof we are to treate in order.</P>

<P>The extremities of the Axletree are called the Poles of the world, &s;o called <HI>Poli</HI> from the Greeke verbe <GAP DESC="foreign">, that is to &s;ay, I turne, whence they are called by the Latins, <HI>vertices,</HI> as turnings and hinges, becau&s;e all the round frame of the world wheeleth about them, whereof the one of them is called <HI>Arcticus ur&s;alis,</HI> or the Beare-pole, from the Greek word <GAP DESC="foreign">; that is to &s;ay, a Beare, which is a con&s;tellation in Hea|ven, neere unto this Circle, the other is named <HI>Antarcticus,</HI> becau&s;e it is right again&s;t, and Diametrically oppo&s;ite to the Pole <HI>Arcticke.</HI></P>
<P>The Pole <HI>Arcticke,</HI> is that which appeareth alwayes in the places, where we inha|bite, and hath divers names, as <HI>Borealis,</HI> or <HI>Boreas,</HI> and al&s;o <HI>Aquilonaris</HI> or <HI>Aquilonius,</HI> from the wind <HI>Boreas,</HI> or <HI>Aquilo</HI> which bloweth from this corner, and is called al&s;o <HI>Septentrionalis,</HI> from the &s;eaven Starres, which the Latins call <HI>Triones,</HI> and which are commonly called <HI>Charles Waine.</HI></P>
<P>The Pole <HI>Antarcticke,</HI> is termed al&s;o by the Latins, <HI>Au&s;tralis,</HI> and <HI>Au&s;trinus,</HI> and <HI>Notius,</HI> from the winde called <HI>Au&s;ter,</HI> and <HI>Notus,</HI> and <HI>Meridionalis,</HI> which is the Southerne windes, taking the name from that Region of the world, and is never &s;eene in this our Hemi&s;phere, but lies hid under the <HI>Horizon.</HI> Moreover, the Globe of the earth is accompanied with eight principall Circles, doubly divided. Fir&s;t, into an equall number, the greater and le&s;&s;er: the greater are the&s;e which have the &s;ame Center as the world hath, and which cut and divide the Globe, or the Sphere into two equal parts. They are called in this manner <HI>Aequinoctiall</HI> or <HI>Aequator, Zodiaque, Hori|zon, Meridian.</HI> The le&s;&s;er circles are tho&s;e, which have a different Center, and o|ther then that of the Globe, or of the Sphere, and part the Sphere or Globe into two equall parts. The&s;e are the two Tropickes, and the two <HI>Polars,</HI> or the Poles of the world.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. III.</HI> Of the foure great Circles.</HEAD>
<P>_THe&s;e great Circles are di&s;tingui&s;hed into fixed, and mooveable. The fixed. immoveable are tho&s;e, which alwayes hold one and the &s;ame place in the Globe, or in the Sphere, and hence it comes, that they are pointed out upon the &s;uperficies or upper face of the Globe. The&s;e are the <HI>Aequator,</HI> and the <HI>Zodiaque.</HI> The moveable are tho&s;e, which are not alwayes &s;et|led in one place, but change their place diver&s;ly, and according to the variety, and change of places and Countries, and for this cau&s;e are placed, without the Superficies of the Sphere, the&s;e are they which are named <HI>Horizon,</HI> and <HI>Meridian,</HI> but it beho|veth us to &s;peake of each of them in particular.</P>
<P><GAP DESC="foreign">, <HI>Horizon,</HI> by the Latins is called <HI>Terminator, Finitor,</HI> and <HI>Finiens,</HI> a <HI>Bounder.</HI> a <HI>Finiter,</HI> or Fini&s;hing, which is a great Circle, moveable, which &s;eparateth the vi|&s;ible
<PB N="51" REF="38">
part of the world from the invi&s;ible, that is to &s;ay, the inferiour Hemi&s;phere from the Superiour. It is very well repre&s;ented upon the covercle or upon the upper face of the Globe, for the &s;uperficies thereof, which is the upper part, maketh the true office of the <HI>Horizon,</HI> when it divideth the whole Globe into two equall parts. Now the &s;aid <HI>Horizon</HI> is of two &s;orts; the one which is conceived by rea&s;on, and under|&s;tanding, the other, which is knowne by the &s;en&s;e. That which is comprehended by the Intellect hath it extention unto the Sphere of the fixed Starres, and divideth into two equall parts, the whole Globe of the world, &s;o that one of the&s;e Hemi&s;pheres ap|peareth above the Earth, and the other is hidden under the earth, and is divided againe into two &s;orts, the one right, the other oblique; the right is that which pa&s;&s;eth a thwart from the two Poles of the world, hath its Pole, or point verticall under the <HI>Aequator,</HI> which cutteth betweene them in forme of right angles. The oblique is called that, who&s;e pole, or point verticall meeteth either on this &s;ide, or that &s;ide of the <HI>Aequator,</HI> and cutteth the <HI>Aequator</HI> by oblique angles. The one being elevated on high from the Poles of the world, the other altogether declining downeward. Tho&s;e which have this <HI>Horizon,</HI> perceive the ri&s;ing, and the &s;etting of the Sunne, and of the other Starres by oblique motion. But the <HI>Horizon</HI> we know by &s;en&s;e, is that which being bounded and terminated by our &s;ight, extendeth as farre as our &s;ight can pearce, &s;eparating the vi&s;ible part of the Globe, from that which is invi&s;ible, the Diameter whereof, is a hundred and foure&s;core furlongs in length, that is to &s;ay, two and twenty thou&s;and paces, and a halfe, or five thou&s;and of <HI>Germane,</HI> with the five eight parts. And is thought that it pa&s;&s;eth no further; becau&s;e that our &s;ight cannot extend any further. The <HI>Horizon</HI> is called moveable or divers, becau&s;e one cannot change the place, to any place whither&s;oever he goeth, be&s;ides, if one move out of his place never &s;o little, which wayes he will, even in that in&s;tant he changeth al&s;o the <HI>Horizon,</HI> the Heaven, and the Region, and by this meanes one may imagine an in|finity of <HI>Horizons.</HI> It is likewi&s;e to be knowne, that the <HI>Horizon</HI> hath two Poles, whereof one of them in the <HI>Arabicke</HI> tongue, is called <HI>Semith,</HI> and by the vulgar cor|rupted, <HI>Zenith,</HI> and is no other thing, than a point which is right over the crowne of our heads, the other is commonly called <HI>Nadir,</HI> but to &s;peake more properly <HI>Na|thir,</HI> Diametrically oppo&s;ite to the other, and is right over the head of the <HI>An|tipodes.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Equinoctiall</HI> is a word borrowed from the Latine <HI>Aequinoctialis,</HI> which is al&s;o cal|led <HI>Aequidialis,</HI> and in Greeke, <GAP DESC="foreign">, from the word, <GAP DESC="foreign">, that is to &s;ay, alike, and from <GAP DESC="foreign">, that is to &s;ay, day, and be&s;ides is tearmed by the Latins <HI>Aequator.</HI> This is a Circle of the Sphere, the greate&s;t of the five Parallels, and which divideth the Globe into two equall parts, the <HI>Septentrionall,</HI> and the <HI>Meridionall,</HI> di&s;tant by an equall &s;pace from the two Poles, whereunto, when the Sunne is once come, it maketh through the whole world, the night and the day of an equall length and du|rance, whence likewi&s;e it taketh the name of <HI>Aequidiall,</HI> and <HI>Aequinoctiall.</HI> The <HI>Aequinoxe,</HI> or <HI>Aequidiall,</HI> as the ancients call them, happen twice a yeare, the one in the beginning of the &s;igne <HI>Aries,</HI> or the Ramme, which is called vernall, and the other in the beginning of <HI>Libra,</HI> or the Ballance, called Autumne. But Navigators commonly call the <HI>Equator,</HI> the middle line, or &s;imply the Line, by a certaine Empha|&s;is, or by prerogative and excellency.</P>
<P>The <HI>Zodiaque</HI> is one of the greate&s;t Circles of the Sphere, placed cro&s;&s;e-wi&s;e be|tweene the two Poles of the world, which toucheth with the one &s;ide the e&s;tivall <HI>Tropicke,</HI> in the beginning of <HI>Cancer,</HI> or of the Crab, and with the other the Hyemall <HI>Tropicke,</HI> in the beginning of <HI>Capricorne,</HI> cutting the <HI>Aequator</HI> in the middle, and is likewi&s;e by the &s;ame <HI>Aequator,</HI> cut in the beginning of <HI>Aries,</HI> and <HI>Libra,</HI> &s;o that the one halfe thereof boweth towards the Pole <HI>Arctique,</HI> and the other on that part of the Pole <HI>Antarctique:</HI> it is divided into twelve parts, which are co~monly called the twelve &s;ignes, from whence commeth the Latine word <HI>Signifer,</HI> that is to &s;ay, Signe-bearer, and the Greeke <GAP DESC="foreign"> from the Greeke word <GAP DESC="foreign">, that is to &s;ay, Animal, or Bea&s;t; becau&s;e there are repre&s;ented in it the twelve &s;ignes of living Creatures, the names whereof, the Poet <HI>Au&s;oinus</HI> hath compri&s;ed in this Di&s;tique.</P>

The tropicke of <HI>Cancer,</HI> or the Crab, which is al&s;o called E&s;tivall, is neare&s;t to the North among all the circles, through the which the Sunne maketh his cour&s;e; to which when it commeth, it goeth no further towards the North, but returnes againe to the other part of the world, towards the South, taking againe his E&s;tivall cour&s;e, in which time, the dayes are at the longe&s;t of all the yeare in our Hemi&s;phere, and the nights the &s;horte&s;t: and this name, the tropicke of <HI>Cancer</HI> was given to it, from the &s;igne <HI>Cancer,</HI> or the Crab, which is in the Zodiaque, in&s;tantly, whereupon, the Sunne beginneth to returne. The tropicke of <HI>Capricorne,</HI> which is called al&s;o Hybernall, is the circle neare&s;t to the South of all other, thorow the middle whereof the Sunne pa&s;&s;eth, whereunto the Sunne being once come, goeth no further toward the Meridio|nall part, but makes his returne in the Winter towards the Septentrionall part, which makes us to have the longe&s;t nights of all the yeare, and &s;horte&s;t dayes.

<P>There are two polare circles farthe&s;t of all, and next neighboures to the Poles, being equally di&s;tant from their Poles, whereof the one of them, is that which we alwayes &s;ee, and is called <HI>Arctique,</HI> as the Pole it &s;elfe is, from the Greeke word <GAP DESC="foreign">, that is to &s;ay, Beare; becau&s;e it is marked neare the feete. with the little Beare: it is called

<P>The <HI>Zones</HI> receive &s;undrie denominations, according to the qualitie and the nature of their &s;ituations; the one is called the Torride, or burning Zone, the two others are called cold, and &s;omewhat temperate: that which lies in the midde&s;t betweene the foure others is called the Torride, becau&s;e of the heate of the Sunne, which is perpe|tually hot and burning in this place, over which he pa&s;&s;eth, and the way through which it goeth, for which rea&s;on the ancients thought it unhabitable.</P>
<P>This then is the Torride zone, which is a &s;pace of place &s;ituated, betweene the two Tropickes, which containeth 47. degrees in latitude, and over which the <HI>Equinoctiall</HI> circle that cutteth it, and divideth it in the middle is &s;ituated.

<P>Moreover the climats are di&s;tingui&s;hed into tho&s;e, which are Septentrionals, and the Meridionalls, either of them taking their beginning from the <HI>Equator,</HI> extending towards their proper Pole. Hence it comes to pa&s;&s;e, that where the climate lieth fur|the&s;t from the <HI>Equator,</HI> &s;o many halfe houres, the longe&s;t day exceedeth the day e|quall to the night, to wit, which is twelve houres, and going backward giveth you to under&s;tand, under what parallell, or climate every place is &s;ituated, you are to marke well the number of houres, of which the longe&s;t day in the &s;ame place, exceedeth the day of the right &s;phere (which as is &s;aid) is alwayes twelve houres; for this number being doubled, &s;heweth the number of the Climates, and being quadruple, giveth you to under&s;tand the number of the parallel.</P>
<P>Moreover, antiquitie knew onely but &s;eaven Climates, being of opinion, that that which was beyond the &s;eventh climate, could hardly be accounted habitable, being not as yet di&s;covered.</P>
<P>The&s;e climates tooke their denominations from the mo&s;t renowned places, over which the middle place of the climates extended, namely, the fir&s;t was called <HI>per Me|roen</HI> or <HI>dia Meroes,</HI> which was an Ile lying upon the river of <HI>Nilus,</HI> and a city in <HI>Africa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI> The &s;econd, <HI>per Sienem,</HI> a towne of <HI>Egypt.</HI> The fourth, <HI>per Rhodum,</HI> or <HI>dia Rhodes,</HI> an Iland well knowne.

But our mo|derne Authors, who have found out by experience, that the earth was inhabited be|yond the&s;e above &s;aid climates, have &s;uppo&s;ed five and twentie climates, reaching o|ver the 67. degree of the elevation of the Pole; the fir&s;t was over <HI>Meroes,</HI> the &s;econd over <HI>Syena</HI> under the E&s;tiuall tropicke, the third over <HI>Alexandrino,</HI> the fourth over <HI>Rhodes,</HI> the fifth over <HI>Rome</HI> and <HI>Helle&s;pont,</HI> the &s;ixt over <HI>Millan</HI> and <HI>Venice,</HI> the &s;eventh over <HI>Podolia</HI> and <HI>Tartaria</HI> the le&s;&s;er, the eighth over <HI>Wittenberge,</HI> the ninth over <HI>Ro&s;tocke,</HI> the tenth over <HI>Ireland,</HI> the eleventh over <HI>Bohoja</HI> a fortre&s;&s;e in <HI>Norway,</HI> the twelfth over <HI>Gutie,</HI> the thirteenth over <HI>Bergin</HI> a towne in <HI>Norway,</HI> the foureteenth o|ver <HI>Viburgh</HI> a towne in <HI>Finland,</HI> the fifteenth over <HI>Arotia</HI> a towne of <HI>Sweatbland,</HI> the &s;ixteenth over the mouth of the river of <HI>Dalenkaul,</HI> and the other which remaine over the other places of <HI>Norway, Sweathland, Ru&s;sia,</HI> and the places bordering upon the next Iles by the like internall. Now it is certaine that from the <HI>Equinoctiall</HI> circle, to the place where the longe&s;t day is limited to twentie foure houres, it hath the exten|&s;ion of twentie foure climates, but from this place to the Pole, the climates cannot be certainely di&s;tingui&s;hed; becau&s;e that from thence afterward the dayes encrea&s;e in &s;uch a &s;ort, fir&s;t not by halfe houres, but from the beginning by whole dayes: after by weekes, and in time by moneths, &s;o that under the Poles, one of the Hemi&s;pheres is enlightned and dried by the light of the dayes, which la&s;t &s;ixe moneths: the other by the like &s;pace of time, is overca&s;t with a thicke darkene&s;&s;e and a continuall night.</P>
<P>For the re&s;t the &s;ame con&s;ideration, which hath beene made of the climates from the <HI>Equinoctiall</HI> towards the Pole <HI>Arctique,</HI> the like al&s;o mu&s;t be ob&s;erved from the &s;ame <HI>Equinoctiall</HI> on that &s;ide, which lieth towards the Pole <HI>Antarctique,</HI> in making alike number of them, neverthele&s;&s;e, the Authors have given no other proper appellations to &s;uch climes, but named them by tho&s;e which were oppo&s;ite to them, adding this Greeke prepo&s;ition <GAP DESC="foreign">, to them, as <GAP DESC="foreign">, that is to &s;ay, oppo&s;ite to that which is over again&s;t <HI>Meroe,</HI> and &s;o of the others, as <GAP DESC="foreign">, which is oppo&s;ite to that which pa&s;&s;eth over <HI>Syena,</HI> notwith&s;tanding, a man may call them by the &s;ame proper name, as the others: as the fir&s;t Climate, by the mountaines of the Moone, and the &s;ources of <HI>Nilus;</HI> the &s;econd, by the Promontory commonly called <HI>Cabo de Corientes,</HI> under the <HI>Hybernall</HI> tropicke, and &s;o of others: but for the more ea&s;ie conceiving of the latitude of the Climates and Parallels from the <HI>Equinoctiall,</HI> the di&s;tances of the one from the other, and the length of the longe&s;t dayes, we have prefixed this follow|ing Table.</P>

<P>_THE circumference and roundne&s;&s;e of the whole circle, according to the Geometritians, is divided into 360. parts, and this &s;ame divi&s;ion is re|ceived into the &s;ection of the Sphere and of the Globe. The earth then, as the &s;phere is divided into 360. parts which they call degrees. Every de|gree is divided into 60. &s;cruples, which make a thou&s;and <HI>Romane</HI> &s;paces, or an <HI>Italian</HI> mile, or an ordinary <HI>Almaine</HI> mile: &s;o that every degree containeth 15. <HI>Germaine</HI> miles, and the whole counted together, make five thou&s;and and foure hun|dred: which is the whole circumference of all the Globe of the earth: and its Diame|ter, or the halfe part thereof equally in two, is a thou&s;and &s;even hundred and eigh|teene <HI>Germane</HI> miles, with two elevenths: the &s;emi-diameter, from the &s;uperficies of the center, eight hundred fiftie nine, with one eleventh.</P>
<P>Moreover, the degrees by which the earth is mea&s;ured, are of two &s;orts, the one of Longitude, the other of Latitude. The longitudes are di&s;tingui&s;hed by the Meridian circles, and the Latitudes by the Parallels. There are thirtie &s;ixe Meridians, which are fa&s;tned upon the Globe, every Meridian having tenne degrees, which number being multiplied, maketh three hundred &amp; &s;ixty <HI>Ptolomy</HI> hath placed the fir&s;t Meridian in the fortunate Iles, which at this day are called the <HI>Canaries,</HI> &s;ince the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Pylots have placed it in the Ile of Go&s;-hawkes, which their language is called <HI>A&s;&s;ores,</HI> and &s;ome of them placed it in the mid&s;t of <HI>Spaine.</HI> From the <HI>Equator</HI> to the one or the other Pole, are marked out nine Parallels, each of them containing tenne degrees: then multiply|ing this number by foure, ye &s;hall finde in all thirtie &s;ixe parallels, as in the Longitude: Now wee mu&s;t hold that the Longitude is a certaine &s;pace or internall of the <HI>Equator,</HI> clo&s;ed betweene Meridians, the one from the Iles called <HI>A&s;&s;ores,</HI> from whence it taketh the beginning, the other from that place or Region, whereof we would know the di&s;tance. As touching the breadth or elevation, that is, a going backeward, or the length of a place or of a Countrey di&s;tant from the <HI>Equator,</HI> either towards the one or the other Pole. Al&s;o the elevation of the Pole is the &s;ame as is the Latitude from a place. But this Latitude is of two &s;orts, the one is Septentrionall from the <HI>Equator,</HI> to the Pole <HI>Arctque</HI> in our Hemi&s;phere; the other is Meridionall or <HI>Au&s;tral,</HI> from the <HI>E|quator</HI> in the inferiour Hemi&s;phere to the Pole <HI>Antarctique.</HI></P>

<HEAD>The Preface upon ATLAS.</HEAD>
<P><HI>_ATLAS</HI> King of Mauritania, was borne of a Royall race, and had for his father <HI>Serrenus,</HI> or <HI>Indigena</HI> (as <HI>Eu&s;ebius</HI> witne&s;&s;eth out of the mo&s;t ancient Historians) who&s;e &s;urname was <HI>Coelus,</HI> and who&s;e mother was <HI>Titea,</HI> &s;urnamed <HI>Terra;</HI> his great Grand|father on the fathers and mothers &s;ide was <HI>Elius</HI> or <HI>Sol,</HI> King of Phoenice, who with his wife <HI>Beruth,</HI> dwelt in Biblius, both of them excellently ver&s;ed in A&s;tronomy, and in natural di&s;ciplines, &s;o that for their learning &s;ake, they were accounted worthy of the names of <HI>Sol</HI> and of <HI>Coelum;</HI> undoubtedly this <HI>Atlas,</HI> as the Ancients report (namely <HI>Diodorus</HI> in his fourth Booke and fifth Chapter) was a mo&s;t skilfull A&s;trologer, and the fir&s;t among men that di&s;puted of the Sphaere. He had many brethren to the number of fortie five, whom <HI>Coelus</HI> begat of divers women, whereof <HI>17.</HI> of them he had by <HI>Titea,</HI> a mo&s;t prudent Matron, that did many good offices to men, whom he after their mothers name called <HI>Titanes.</HI> Hee had al&s;o &s;i&s;ters, among whom the principall were <HI>Ba&s;ilea,</HI> who in favour of her mother, brought up all her brethren, and there|fore they called her Grandmother, and <HI>Rea Pandora.</HI> Now after the decea&s;e of <HI>Coelus, Ba&s;i|lea</HI> being the elde&s;t, and excelling the others in prudence and vertue, by the common con&s;ent of her brethren and the people being a Virgine and unmarried, &s;hee obtained the kingdome. Afterwards being de&s;irous to leave an heire behind her, &s;he was married to her brother <HI>Hy|perion,</HI> and &s;he bare him two children, to wit, <HI>Sol</HI> and <HI>Luna,</HI> who&s;e prudence <HI>Hyperions</HI> bre|thren admiring to the intent the kingdome might not be &s;etled upon his i&s;&s;ue, they ma&s;&s;acred him, and drowned <HI>Sol</HI> his Sonne, being yet an infant in the River of <HI>Eridanus.</HI> Then the Sonnes of <HI>Coelus</HI> whereof the noble&s;t of them were <HI>Atlas,</HI> and <HI>Saturnus,</HI> &s;hared their Fathers kingdome, betweene them. <HI>Atlas</HI> had for his part, tho&s;e Countries, which lay next unto the Ocean, and <HI>Lybia,</HI> and the &s;traights of <HI>Gibraltar;</HI> whence <HI>Mount-Atlas,</HI> and the Atlanticke people in <HI>Mauritania</HI> tooke fir&s;t their name, and <HI>Saturnus</HI> obtained <HI>Sicilia,</HI> and <HI>Lybia,</HI> who being afterward hated of his people, for the crueltie he u&s;ed again&s;t his father <HI>Coelus,</HI> fled in|to <HI>Italy,</HI> where by <HI>Ianus</HI> he was made partaker ef the kingdome. Now for as much as <HI>Dio|dorus</HI> alleageth, that <HI>Coelus</HI> was the fir&s;t King that reigned among&s;t the Atlantickes, the people being before disper&s;ed up and downe in fields in <HI>Colonies,</HI> he admoni&s;hed them, to gather them&s;elves together, and to build Townes. Without all que&s;tion the&s;e Kings were very an|cient, becau&s;e <HI>Atlas,</HI> &s;onne of <HI>Atlas,</HI> having cha&s;ed away his brother, <HI>He&s;perus</HI> was King of <HI>Iberia,</HI> which afterwards in the yeare <HI>738,</HI> after the univer&s;all floud was called <HI>Spaine. He&s;perus</HI> flying into <HI>Etruria,</HI> where he was made tutour to <HI>Ianus.</HI> The Grandfather of <HI>A|tlas (Elias)</HI> reigned in <HI>Phoenice,</HI> anno <HI>662.</HI> after the deluge. And <HI>Diodorus</HI> witne&s;&s;eth, that tho&s;e Kings out of the nature of things, and the contemplation of them, attained to excellent knowledge, and withall became pious, and more humane, that as <HI>Diodorus</HI> truely &s;aith, the <HI>Atlantiks</HI> bore away the Bell for their pietie, and humanity to &s;trangers, from all o|ther Nations what&s;oever, when there were &s;carcely not above <HI>22.</HI> or <HI>23.</HI> generations com|pleate, and many parts of the earth not yet inhabited. <HI>Atlas</HI> had many &s;onnes, but among the re&s;t, one famous for his piety, ju&s;tice, and courte&s;ie to his &s;ubjects. His name was He&s;perus, who a&s;cending up to the top of mount <HI>Atlas,</HI> to &s;earch out diligently the cour&s;es of the &s;tarres, was on a &s;udaine violently carried away with winde, and appeared no more. So much <HI>Diodorus</HI> &s;peaketh of him: but in my opinion (as I have &s;aid) I find he was King in <HI>Iberia,</HI> into which at la&s;t, he came with a prosperous winde, where he lived &s;o prudently, and religiou&s;ly, that when he fled into <HI>Etruria,</HI> being driven from thence by his brother, for his excellent wi&s;edome and prudence, he was made Tutor to <HI>Ianus,</HI> and admini&s;trator of the King|dome, which offices <HI>Atlas</HI> his brother undertooke. My purpo&s;e then is to follow this <HI>Atlas,</HI> a man &s;o excelling in erudition, humanity, and wi&s;edome (as from a loftie watch tower) to con|template Co&s;mography, as much as my &s;trength and ability will permit me, to &s;ee if perad|venture by my diligence, I may finde out &s;ome truths in things yet unknowne, which may &s;erve to the &s;tudy of wi&s;edome. And as the world containeth the number of all things, the &s;pecies, order, harmony, proportion, vertues and effects; &s;o beginning from the Creation, I wil number al the parts thereof, &s;o far as methodical rea&s;on requireth, according to the order of the creation, and will contemplate phy&s;ically, that the cau&s;es of things may be knowne, where|of con&s;i&s;teth that &s;cience of &s;ciences wi&s;edome, which directeth every good thing to a good end,
<PB REF="46">
by a provident wi&s;edome, which doth facilitate the way to the ends. This is the maine &s;cope I aime at. Afterward J will handle coelestiall things in their ranke: then the A&s;tronomicks; which appertaine to conjecture by the Starres. Fourthly, treate of things Elementary, and la&s;tly, the Geographicks, and &s;o as (in a mirrour) will &s;et before your eyes, the whole world, that in making u&s;e of &s;ome rudiments, ye may find out the cau&s;es of things, and &s;o by attai|ning unto wi&s;edome and prudence, by this meanes leade the Reader to high &s;peculations.</P>

For the contemplation of Generals is plea&s;ant, and very nece&s;&s;ary to him, who de&s;ireth to have the lea&s;t knowledge of the World and naturall things. For if you plea&s;e to con&s;ider the manner of the ri&s;ing and &s;etting of the Sunne, what is the cau&s;e of Summer or Winter, whence is the inequality of the Dayes and Nights, or la&s;tly, what hath beene the originals, or propagations of things, what hath beene the actions, the atchievements, the mutations, and conver&s;ions happening in any place, even from the fir&s;t Creation, you &s;hall learne all this no where better, than out of the&s;e five adjoyning Tables, with|out all danger, and with hone&s;t recreation of minde. And even as it is not &s;ufficient for any one, though hee have a large dwelling-place, to know the &s;everall parts of his hou&s;e, as the Porch, the Wine-cellar, and Butterie, the Kitchin, the Parlour, the Supping-roome, the Bed cham|ber, the Clo&s;et, the Studie, &amp;c. whereby hee may u&s;e them conveni|ently; but al&s;o it is fit and nece&s;&s;ary, that hee &s;hould know, in what part and &s;treet of the Citie his hou&s;e &s;tandeth, and thence hee may &s;traight|way di&s;cerne, if any fire or tumult happen in the Citie, how neare or

The &s;ame <HI>Apuleius</HI> more elaborately de&s;cribes the world thus; or to this purpo&s;e. The world (&s;aith hee) is a garni&s;hed ordinance of things, the ju&s;t charge and cu&s;todie of the Gods, who&s;e pole, (for &s;o I call the Cen|ter) beeing &s;trong and immoveable, pa&s;&s;eth through the earth, the Mo|ther and nouri&s;her of all living creatures. All the higher parts, as may be &s;eene, being enclo&s;ed and hidden with the moi&s;tne&s;&s;e of the aire in manner of a covering: Beyond is the hou&s;e of the Gods, called Heaven, which wee &s;ee is full of divine bodies, as the faire and &s;hining lights of the Sunne, Moone, and the other Starres, with which it is carried about by the diurnall and nocturnall motion in &s;uch a perpetuall cour&s;e, as &s;hall never have an end. Now that the forme thereof is gathered round together like a Globe, the name thereof doth declare, and the con&s;ent of men calling and painting it in manner of a Globe; be&s;ides diver&s;e arguments that prove the &s;ame: As becau&s;e &s;uch a figure is mo&s;t capable, mo&s;t &s;imple, and doth bend in all parts towards it &s;elfe, &s;u&s;taines it &s;elfe, includes and containes it &s;elfe, wanting no joyning together, nor having any end or beginning in any of its parts: as al&s;o becau&s;e where|&s;oever you behold it, it hath a circular forme in all its parts, which can|not happen in another figure.

We, leaving tho&s;e things which belong to A&s;tronomers and Philo&s;ophers, will chiefly con&s;ider the Globe of the Earth.

Their Grapes are like Sloes which grow upon thornes and bu&s;hes, and are covered with blacke leaves: but becau&s;e they are more woody then juycie, therefore the inhabitants doe not make wine of them. There are in this Country Trees bearing Olives, but &s;uch as are of an unplea&s;ant &s;mell, and of a wor&s;e ta&s;te: and diver&s;e other kindes of fruits in great abundance, as tho&s;e which they call <HI>Hovi, Platani, Pineae, Guiavae, Ma|mei,</HI> and <HI>Guanavanae;</HI> it bringeth forth Sugar, Cotton-wooll, Hempe, and other things as with us, be&s;ide divers &s;orts of &s;trange Trees and Herbes.

It doth bring to us divers living Creatures, partly knowne to us, and partly unknowne.

There are</HI> (&s;aith hee) <HI>divers arguments brought by divers men on both &s;ides, and it is diver&s;ly judged of, whether it be po&s;sible to &s;aile by that Sea. But the&s;e are ours.

In Summer there are continuall mi&s;ts, which in the afternoone as fa&s;t as one is expelled another ri&s;es.

the Kings and the Kings Sonnes lawfully begotten have the fir&s;t place, of which if there bee many, the elde&s;t Sonne is called Prince of <HI>Scotland,</HI> the re&s;t are onely called Princes, but when the King is publick|ly crowned, hee promi&s;eth to all the people, that he will keepe and ob|&s;erve the Lawes, Rites, and Cu&s;tomes of his Ance&s;tours, and u&s;e them in the &s;ame manner as they did. The Dukes have the &s;econd place, the Earles the third, and tho&s;e Nobles the fourth place, who are not known by that Title in forraine Countries, but the <HI>Scots</HI> doe call them <HI>My Lords.</HI> This name is &s;o much e&s;teem'd among&s;t them, that for honours &s;ake they attribute it to their Bi&s;hops, Earles, and chiefe&s;t Magi&s;trates. In the fifth place are the Knights and Barons, who are u&s;ually called Lords. They are in the &s;ixth and la&s;t place, who having attained to no title of honour, but yet de&s;cended from a noble Familie, are therefore commonly called Gentlemen; as the Brothers, and Sonnes of Earles and Lords, the younge&s;t Sonnes of Knights, who have no part in the Inheritance, becau&s;e (by the Lawes of <HI>Scotland</HI>) that commeth unto the elde&s;t Sonne, for the pre&s;ervation of the Familie, but the common peo|ple call all tho&s;e Gentlemen, who are either rich or well &s;poken of for their ho&s;pitality. The whole weight of warre doth depend on the No|bility of the lowe&s;t degree. The Plebeians or Citizens are partly chiefe men, who beare office in their Cities, partly Merchants, and partly Trade&s;men, or Handy-craftes-men, all which becau&s;e they are free from Tribute and other burdens, doe ea&s;ily grow rich. And lea&s;t any thing &s;hould be too heavily enacted again&s;t any Citie, the King permits that in publick a&s;&s;emblies or Parliaments three or foure Citizens, being called out of every Citie, &s;hould freely interpo&s;e their opinion concer|ning matters propounded. Heretofore the Clergie was governed by the authoritie of Decrees &amp; Councels, but now (as the re&s;t) they are ru|led by the Lawes, which the Kings have devi&s;ed, or confirmed by their royall a&s;&s;ent. The Booke which containeth the <HI>municipall</HI> Lawes, writ|ten in Latine, is entituled <HI>Regia Maje&s;tas,</HI> the Kings Maje&s;tie, becau&s;e the Booke begins with tho&s;e words: In the other Bookes of the Lawes, the Acts of their Councels (which are called Parliaments) are written in <HI>Scotch.</HI> There are many and divers Magi&s;trates in <HI>Scotland,</HI> as in other Nations. Among the&s;e, the chiefe and next to the King is the Prote|ctour of the Kingdome (whom they call the Governour.) Hee hath the charge of governing the Kingdome, if the Common-wealth at any time be deprived of her King; or the King by rea&s;on of his tender age cannot manage the affaires of the Kingdome. There is al&s;o a continuall Senate at <HI>Edenburrough,</HI> &s;o framed of the Clergie and Nobilitie, that the Clergie doth in number equall the Laiety. The Clergie have a Pre&s;i|dent over them, who hath the fir&s;t place in delivering his opinion, un|le&s;&s;e the Chancellour of the Kingdome bee pre&s;ent, for hee hath the chiefe place in all affaires of the Kingdome. Hee that &s;its on matters of life and death, they call The great Ju&s;tice; hee that lookes to Sea-mat|ters, the Admirall: he that lookes to the Campe, the Mar&s;hall: and he that puni&s;hes offences, committed in the Court, is called the Con&s;table. There are al&s;o in &s;everall Provinces, which they call Viecounties, tho&s;e which are Governours of them, whom by an ancient name they

call Vicounts. Their authority in deciding tho&s;e matters which belong to civill cau&s;es, doth depend on a certaine hereditary right, by which they claime al&s;o unto them&s;elves tho&s;e Vicount&s;hips. So that the&s;e Vi|counts may be &s;aid not to be created by the King, but borne unto it by right from their Parents. The Cities al&s;o and Townes have their Go|vernours, their Bailiffes, and other Magi&s;trates of that kinde, who keepe the Citizens in obedience, and doe maintaine and defend the Priviled|ges of the Cities, whereby it comes to pa&s;&s;e that the Common-wealth of <HI>Scotland,</HI> by the apt di&s;po&s;ition and ranking of Degrees, by the holy Maje&s;tie of Lawes and the authority of Magi&s;trates, doth flouri&s;h, and de&s;erveth great prai&s;e.

<HEAD>THE STATE POLITICK OF THE KINGDOME OF DENMARKE.</HEAD>
<P>_DENMARKE is a large and populous Kingdome, commonly called <HI>Danemarch,</HI> as it were the Countrie of the <HI>Danes.</HI> But whence the originall of the <HI>Danes</HI> came, they them|&s;elves doe not know: Some doe fetch it from <HI>Danus,</HI> their fir&s;t King, and &s;ome from the <HI>Dahi,</HI> a people of <HI>A&s;ia, Dudo de S. Quintino,</HI> an ancient Writer (as <HI>Camden</HI> reporteth) doth af|firme, that they came out of <HI>Scandia</HI> into the ancient &s;eats of the <HI>Cimbri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">+ans.</HI> But they &s;eeme to be &s;o called from the waters, becau&s;e AHA with them &s;ignifies a River, and they doe call them&s;elves <HI>Daneman</HI> (that is) <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s it were, River-men, or Water-men. All <HI>Denmarke</HI> is a <HI>Penin&s;ula,</HI> as the De&s;cription &s;heweth, and is divided into 184 Prefect&s;hips or Pro|vinces, which they call <HI>Harret,</HI> and they are governed by &s;o many Pre|fects skilfull in the <HI>Dani&s;h</HI> Lawes. It hath a King rather by election of the Nobles, than by &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of birth: the ancient manner of chu&s;ing him was, that when they gave their voyce, they &s;tood in the open field upon &s;tones, devoting by the firme &s;tabilitie of the &s;tones under them, the con&s;tancy of their election. The Kings are crowned at <HI>Hafnia</HI> in the Church of the ble&s;&s;ed Virgine <HI>Mary</HI> before the Altar, and are led into the afore&s;aid Church by the Senatours of the Kingdome, the en&s;ignes of regality being carried before them, as the Sword, Globe, and Crown. Neither are the&s;e things attributed to &s;peciall Families, as it is in mo&s;t Countries, but as every one excelleth in vertue and dignitie, &s;o is hee cho&s;en to that place. Fir&s;t the King is compelled to &s;weare that he will ob&s;erve certaine written Articles, and that hee will &s;trictly defend the Chri&s;tian Religion, and the Lawes and Cu&s;tomes of the Kingdome. Afterward hee is anoynted by the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Roe&s;child,</HI> and fir&s;t the Crowne is &s;et upon his head by all the Senatours, who then take their oath to his Maje&s;tie, if they have not done it before the Coronation, and then the King maketh out of the Gentry &s;ome Knights by the light &s;troke of a &s;word, for &s;ome &s;ervice done either in peace or warre. Thus the ancient <HI>Danes</HI> did e&s;tabli&s;h an excellent Politicall State and Monar|chie, neither hath any Nation ever brought them into &s;ubjection, or tooke away their Country Rites and Priviledges. But on the contrary the Northerne people, as the <HI>Danes, Swedens, Norwegians,</HI> have wa&s;ted almo&s;t <HI>Europe,</HI> and in &s;ome places have e&s;tabli&s;hed Kingdomes.

<P>By which it appeares, as al&s;o by the followig warres, which divers Kings of the Familie of the <HI>Oldenburgs</HI> happily waged, that it is a war|like Nation, and fortunate in vanqui&s;hing their enemies both by Land and Sea. The Noble men and Senatours of the Kingdome have a free power to elect the Kings, but for the mo&s;t part they chu&s;e the Kings el|de&s;t &s;onne, unle&s;&s;e there be &s;ome &s;ufficient cau&s;e for the contrary. How|ever, they alwayes chu&s;e one of the Royall bloud, and they doe not &s;uffer the Kingdome to be divided, unle&s;&s;e they be compelled thereunto by civill warres. They &s;end the younger &s;onnes or brothers into other Countries, &s;eeing they cannot participate in the government of the Kingdome: and hence it is that &s;o many expeditions are undertaken by them. Moreover, &s;eeing all the Nobles and Common-people can|not live conveniently in their owne Countrie, therefore they &s;eeke out to get them&s;elves a more fit &s;eate. For the Northerne people have a|bundance of children, in regard of their abundance of bloud and heate; they are quarrellers and fighters, they drinke and eate much, (for the cold Ayre excites their appetite) and yet dige&s;t it well, whence it is that they live long; they are faire complexioned, of great &s;tature, crafty and faithfull. And an argument, that they are long liv'd, is that their Kings have raigned very long, many of them thirty yeares, &s;ome forty, and &s;ome longer.</P>

The&s;e hold their goods and lands in <HI>Capite,</HI> and they have free liberty to hawke and hunt in their owne lands, as the Counts have in <HI>Germany.</HI> Their goods are not feudatory, but hereditary. All the Ca&s;tles, lands, and goods, as well moveable as immoveable, left them by their parents, are equally divided among the brethren: and the &s;i&s;ters by a &s;peciall priviledge have a &s;hare al&s;o, yet &s;o, that the brother hath two parts with the Ca&s;tles and places of &s;trength, and the &s;i&s;ter but one. By this meanes the elde&s;t &s;onnes have not much lands, yet &s;ome of them comming of a good Familie, and being endued with ver|tue, through the Kings favour, doe advance them&s;elves to great po&s;&s;e&s;&s;i|ons by marriage. Out of this order the Senatours of the Kingdome are cho&s;en, who are &s;eldome more then 28. The&s;e Senatours have a certain allowance from the King and Kingdome, for they have Ca&s;tles &s;o long as they bee Senatours, for which they pay no rent to the King, but are charged to keepe certaine hor&s;es both in peace and warre, and when&s;o|ever the King calls them, they are to be ready at the proper charge of the Kingdome. If they be &s;ent on any Emba&s;&s;age out of the Kingdome, they have allowance out of the Exchequer, that they may performe their journey in a Princely manner, as becommeth a Kings Emba&s;&s;adours. The other Nobles al&s;o have &s;ufficient maintenance from the King, whe|ther they live at Court or not. For the King hath lands which in the <HI>Da|ni&s;h</HI> &s;peech are called <HI>Verleghninge</HI> or Benefices, and out of the&s;e hee gi|veth maintenance, either for terme of life, or for yeares, to tho&s;e who have done him or the Kingdome any &s;ervice. And tho&s;e who hold the&s;e Benefices of the King, are charged to keepe certaine hor&s;es, and to pay yearely a certaine &s;umme of money into the Exchequer, yet &s;o as they may gaine &s;omething in reward of their labour and &s;ervice. There is al&s;o a good Law &amp; In&s;titution in the Kingdome of <HI>Denmarke,</HI> whereby the King is prohibited and re&s;trained from buying any immoveable goods of the Nobles, lea&s;t any di&s;&s;ention &s;hould ari&s;e betweene the King and them. For otherwi&s;e the King might by violence take into his hands tho&s;e lands which the Nobles would not &s;ell: yet the King may change any immoveable goods with the Nobles, though on the contra|ry the Nobles cannot buy any of them of the Kings Farmers, many of which have hereditarie, and (as it were) free lands.</P>

The Kings Chancellour, who for the mo&s;t part followeth the King in the Court, hath &s;even or eight Noble men adjoyned unto him as A&s;&s;i&s;tants, be&s;ides Secretaries and Clerkes; and all bu&s;ine&s;&s;es are di&s;patch'd by the King him&s;elfe. But if it be &s;ome matter of con&s;equence, as concerning peace or warre, entring into league with forraine Nations, or into con&s;ultation concerning the defending of their owne Territories, then the King calleth a Councell of Senators. Neither can the King impo&s;e any taxe upon the Kingdome or Countrie, without their con&s;ent, and the con&s;ent of the Nobles. There is al&s;o in this Kingdome a Ma&s;ter of the Exchequer, who colle|cteth
<PB N="130" REF="138">
and gathereth all the Revenues of the whole Kingdome, both of Ca&s;tles, Farmes, and Cu&s;tomes, as well by Sea as by Land. Hee taketh account of them, enquireth into them, and giveth acquittances for the receit of them. Hee hath two A&s;&s;i&s;tants of the Nobilitie, and many Clerkes under him; and for his office hath a yearely &s;tipend or pen&s;ion.</P>
<P>The third State is of the Clergie, in which there are &s;even Bi&s;hops, as the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Lunden,</HI> the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Roe&s;child,</HI> the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Otthon,</HI> of <HI>Rip,</HI> of <HI>Wiburg,</HI> of <HI>Arhu&s;e,</HI> and the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Sle&s;wich,</HI> to whom the o|ther Canonicall per&s;ons have relation. The&s;e have the Tenths of the Kingdome; which in divers Countries are divided in a divers manner for the Bi&s;hops have an halfe part of the Tenths, and the King an halfe part, the Canoni&s;ts and Preachers have a part, and a part is contributed toward the building and repairing of Churches. And as concerning the Popes authoritie in this Kingdome, as al&s;o in <HI>France,</HI> the ordination of Prelates and Bi&s;hops have beene alwayes in the Kings power, as may appeare by the an&s;wer of <HI>Woldemare</HI> the fir&s;t, King of <HI>Denmarke,</HI> which heere I have annexed. When the Pope required the&s;e and the like pri|viledges from the King, it is reported, that the King writ back unto him, <HI>Wee have our Kingdome from our Subjects, our life from our Parents, our Reli|ligion from the Romi&s;h Church, which if you will take from us, I &s;end it you by the&s;e pre&s;ents.</HI> And as the wi&s;e Decree of <HI>Charles</HI> the fifth is prai&s;ed, pro|hibiting Eccle&s;ia&s;ticall per&s;ons from buying any immoveable thing without the con&s;ent of the King, &s;o <HI>Christian</HI> the third as wi&s;ely did or|daine, that the Clergie &s;hould not &s;ell any thing without the Kings ex|pre&s;&s;e commandement. In other matters the Clergie-men through the whole kingdome are well provided for by <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> the third, of famous memorie, and many Schooles erected in many places, as al&s;o two in <HI>I&s;eland,</HI> where they have likewi&s;e a Printing-Hou&s;e. There is but one Univer&s;itie in the whole kingdome, called the Univer&s;itie of<NOTE N="h" PLACE="marg">This Citie is called by the <HI>Germans Co|penhagen,</HI> that is, the Mer|chants Haven.</NOTE> <HI>Haft<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"></HI> or <HI>Hafnia,</HI> founded by <HI>Chri&s;terne</HI> the fir&s;t, by permi&s;&s;ion of Pope <HI>Sixt<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">,</HI> in the yeare of Chri&s;t 1470: which <HI>Frederick</HI> the &s;econd, although hee were &s;even yeares incumbred with the <HI>Swethi&s;h</HI> warres, did &s;o enrich that the yearely revenues thereof are very much.</P>
<P>The fourth State is of the Citizens and Merchants, dwelling in Ci|ties and Townes. The&s;e have proper and peculiar priviledges which they enjoy, be&s;ides certaine fields and woods that belong to them; and the&s;e doe traffique both by Sea and Land in all parts of <HI>Europe.</HI> Out of the&s;e, as al&s;o out of the Countrey-people, the Bi&s;hops, the Cano|ni&s;ts, the Preachers, and Senators of Cities, the Clerkes of Bands, the Lievtenants of Towres, and the Ma&s;ters of Ships are cho&s;en, and &s;ome of them are Ma&s;ters of the Cu&s;tomes or Tributes; la&s;tly, of the&s;e all le&s;&s;er Councels of Ju&s;tice doe con&s;i&s;t, one of the Nobility, for the mo&s;t part, &s;itting as Pre&s;ident.</P>
<P>The fifth State is of the Ru&s;tick, or Countrey-people, and there are two &s;orts of them, the fir&s;t they call <HI>Freibunden,</HI> that is, Free-holders. The&s;e doe hold Lands of Inheritance, yet paying for the &s;ame &s;ome little free-rent every yeare. The&s;e doe al&s;o u&s;e merchandi&s;e and fi&s;h|ing. They are not oppre&s;t with doing &s;ervices, neither doe they pay any taxes, unle&s;&s;e the Senators of the kingdome doe grant it as a &s;ub&s;i|die.
<PB N="131" REF="138">
The other &s;ort is of tho&s;e, who doe not po&s;&s;e&s;&s;e goods of inheri|tance, but doe farme them of the King, the Nobles or Eccle&s;ia&s;ticall per&s;ons, and are con&s;trained to doe many &s;ervices for their Lords, in &s;uch manner, as they &s;hall covenant with their Land-lord. The&s;e are the chiefe things which I thought good to declare concerning the <HI>State politick of Denmarke;</HI> whereby it appeareth, that the <HI>Dani&s;h</HI> Monarchie was, for the mo&s;t part, well framed: for the free election of the Kings being in the hands of the Nobilitie, and yet notwith&s;tanding out of the royall Progenie, as wee &s;aid before: it followeth, that the <HI>Danes</HI> have no civill warres or di&s;&s;entions, unle&s;&s;e tho&s;e which are betweene &s;uch as bee of the Blood Royall, which are quickly compo&s;ed by the media|tion and helpe of the Nobles; but e&s;pecially &s;eeing the Kings younger Sonnes can have no part of the kingdome. Moreover, as they are all &s;tiled but Nobles, and know not the titles and names of Barons, Earles, and Dukes, &s;o there are none that have &s;o much wealth and power, as that repo&s;ing tru&s;t therein, they dare oppo&s;e them&s;elves again&s;t the Royall Familie; becau&s;e the Fathers Inheritance is alwayes divided betweene the Sonnes and Daughters. Thus the Kings of <HI>Denmarke</HI> have a flouri&s;hing Common-wealth, which may ea&s;ily bee defended from forraine enemies, whom their Subjects, living in unanimity and con|cord with them as their naturall Lords, are able to re&s;i&s;t both by &s;ea and land.</P>

than fabulous, as al&s;o tho&s;e things be which the <HI>Lydians,</HI> the <HI>Thra|cians, Rhodians, Phrygians, Cyprians, Phoenicians, Aegyptians, Mile&s;ians, Carians, Lesbians,</HI> and <HI>Chaldaeans</HI> are reported to have performed &s;ucce&s;|&s;ively in this countrey. But tho&s;e things are more certaine, which Wri|ters have recorded were heretofore atchieved by the <HI>Carthaginians, Ro|mans, Gothes, Vandals, Alani, Swethlanders, Huns,</HI> and their Kings, for that the Writers of them were either pre&s;ent at tho&s;e actions, or el&s;e came to the knowledge of them by the faithfull relation of others. Of the&s;e things therefore I will &s;peake briefly, and thus it was. When the <HI>Carthaginians</HI> did rule all <HI>Spaine,</HI> and had all things under their owne command, the Senate and people of <HI>Rome</HI> did &s;end fir&s;t of all the two <HI>Scipioes</HI> again&s;t them with an army of Souldiers, in the beginning of the &s;econd <HI>Punick</HI> warre: who were &s;laine in the &s;eventh yeare of that war, <HI>Q. Fulvius Flaccus</HI> and <HI>Ap. Claudius Pulcher</HI> being Con&s;uls. The next year <HI>P. Cornelius Scipio Africanus</HI> being &s;ent next to his Father &amp; Uncle, did performe many things very pro&s;perou&s;ly, and fir&s;t of all made a Province of it, <HI>Q. Caecilius Metellus,</HI> and <HI>L. Veturius Philo</HI> being Con|&s;uls. Fir&s;t, <HI>A&s;drubal</HI> and <HI>Mago Carthaginian</HI> Captaines, being overthrown and put to flight in the battell, neere to the Citie <HI>Baetula</HI> (which is &s;up|po&s;ed to have been in that place where now <HI>Ba&euml;ca</HI> and <HI>Vbeda</HI> are &s;eated) and the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Armies beaten out of <HI>Spaine,</HI> hee e&s;tabli&s;hed a league of friend&s;hip with <HI>Syphax</HI> King of the <HI>Ma&s;silians,</HI> who is now called <HI>Bile|dulgerid;</HI> a litle after hee compelled the rebellious people of <HI>Spaine</HI> to yeeld them&s;elves unto him, and having made a league with <HI>Ma&s;&s;ani&s;&s;a</HI> King of the <HI>Ma&s;ae&s;ulians,</HI> and the <HI>Gaditanes,</HI> hee committed the govern|ment of the Province to <HI>L. Lentulus</HI> and <HI>L. Manlius Acidinus,</HI> and retur|ned to <HI>Rome.</HI> After <HI>Scipio, L. Cornelius Lentulus</HI> the Procon&s;ul did go|verne <HI>Spaine,</HI> and after many pro&s;perous acts and atchievements, entred the Citie in triumph. Three yeares after, <HI>C. Cornelius, Cethegus,</HI> and <HI>Minu|cius Rufus</HI> being Con&s;uls, the two <HI>Spaines</HI> were fir&s;t bounded, and two new Pretors &s;ent into them, <HI>C. Sempronius Tuditanus</HI> into the hither <HI>Spaine,</HI> and <HI>M. Helvetius Bla&s;io</HI> into the farther. Two yeares being &s;carce|ly pa&s;t, &s;o great a warre began in <HI>Spaine,</HI> that it was nece&s;&s;arie, that a Con&s;ul &s;hould be &s;ent out with an Army: <HI>Marcus Portius Cato</HI> Con&s;ul being allotted to goe into the hither part, did &s;o appea&s;e and quiet rebellion, that the Procon&s;ul in regard thereof triumphed. This is that <HI>Cato,</HI> who, as <HI>Livie</HI> writeth and others, by a wonderfull &s;tratagem, did throw downe the wals of many <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Cities in one day. After <HI>Cato</HI>'s victorie, <HI>Spaine</HI> was diver&s;ly po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, and many times lo&s;t and regained againe, &s;o that there were above 30 triumphs for victories obtained heere. They did not begin to pay any taxe, before the time of <HI>Augu&s;tus Cae&s;ar,</HI> who having by long continuance of warres tamed all <HI>Spaine,</HI> and overthrowne the <HI>Cantabrians</HI> and <HI>A&s;turians</HI> that had longe&s;t of all made re&s;i&s;tance, divided the whole Countrie into three Provinces, <HI>Baetica,</HI> &s;o called from the River <HI>Baetis, Lu&s;itania,</HI> and <HI>Tarraconen&s;is,</HI> &s;o called from its citie <HI>Tarracon;</HI> and every one of the&s;e have their Dioce&s;&s;es or Circles of juri&s;diction.

Be&s;ides, adde to this the many famous Cities which are therein, the whole Countries being either tilled, or full of fruites and flocks, the gold-bearing Rivers that water it, and the &s;par|kling pretious &s;tones that enrich it; I know that Poets in their Fables which they have invented to plea&s;e the eare, have attributed miracu|lous things to &s;ome Nations, which whether they are true or not, yet are very &s;trange: neither doe I now &s;eeke out the truth: Let <HI>Gargara</HI> (as it is written) yeeld a great increa&s;e of corne: let <HI>Menavia</HI> be pray|&s;ed for her flocks, <HI>Campania</HI> for the Mountaine <HI>Gaurano, Lydia</HI> for the River <HI>Pactolus, Spaine</HI> hath every thing that is prai&s;e-worthy.

That are three heads e&s;pecially to be con&s;idered in the admini&s;tration of Kingdomes, Principalities, and Provinces, namely the Eccle&s;ia&s;ticall State, the Political State, and the Admini&s;tration of Iu&s;tice: fir&s;t therefore according to the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> of the Countrie de&s;cribed in the Table, I will reckon up how many members <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> parts there are of the Politicall State thereof, according to the order of dignitie as they are ob&s;erved there. Secondly in di&s;tingui&s;hing Noble-mens places (&s;it<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the whole government is in the hands of the Nobilitie) I will in the fir&s;t place reckon tho&s;e who are Feudals to the Prince, and afterward tho&s;e that are free, de&s;cending &s;till in order from the highe&s;t degree of Nobilitie, as Dukes, Earles, Barons, and Lords.

declared. In the admini&s;tration of Iu&s;tice, the juridicall Dioce&s;&s;es &s;hall be noted, and the higher Senates to which appeale may be made. La&s;tly, in the Eccle&s;ia&s;ticall State, the Archbi&s;hops, if there be any, &s;hall bee placed fir&s;t, and then the &s;uffragan Bi&s;hops which are under them, as al&s;o tho&s;e which are &s;uffra|gans to others. To reckon up all the&s;e things requires much &s;tudie, but &s;eeing for want of matter it may be briefly delivered, I will performe what I may, that &s;o I may &s;tirre up lovers of their countrie to emulate a greater perfection in their writings. The &s;everall places &s;hall be noted with numbers, that they may be &s;traight-way found out in the following Table; the fir&s;t number &s;hall containe the degrees and minutes of Longitude, which &s;hall be &s;ought out in the Northerne or Southerne &s;ide of the Table, the later &s;hall have the numbers of Latitude, which are to be &s;ought on the We&s;terne or Ea&s;terne &s;ide. From the&s;e bounds, heere by the direction of the Meridian, and there of the Parallel of La|titude, you &s;hall come at la&s;t to their inter&s;ection, and &s;o finde out the place propounded. The &s;ituation of tho&s;e places which are in the de&s;cription of the generall Tables ought to be &s;ought from thence. But if &s;o be that &s;ome names are not found in the table following, it was the fault of the Chorographer who delineated it, for the right de&s;igning and placing of principalities and domini|ons is not to be omitted. The rule and government of Countries is in the power of the Nobilitie, and therefore it is both profitable and delightfull to know and di&s;tingui&s;h their &s;everall degrees, and the proper conditions of them. The highe&s;t degree is that of Emperour or King, whom in order doe follow the degrees of Duke, Earle, Baron, the militarie Tribune, whom the <HI>Low-country-men</HI> call <HI>Banderheer, qua&s;i Bendae,</HI> that is, Lord of the Troupes, which he leadeth under his Banner. After him is the Knight, or hee that hath attained to be of the Hor&s;emans Order, whom the <HI>French-men</HI> doe call <HI>Chevalier,</HI> and the <HI>Low-country-men Ridder.</HI> In the la&s;t place is <HI>vn E&s;cuyer,</HI> who beareth Armes, but hath attained to no publick dignitie. There are three degrees of Earles, the fir&s;t whereof the <HI>French-men</HI> call <HI>Viconte,</HI> who excelleth the re&s;t in dignity &amp; priviledges, <HI>Ludovic. Guic.</HI> would have him now called a <HI>Bur|grave.</HI> And though this Order of Earles in time hath remitted &s;omething of its honour, yet in the beginning it was of more excellent dignitie, as the de&s;crip|tion thereof &s;hall by and by declare. In the &s;econd degree is the Earle Provinci|all, who is called in <HI>Dutch, Landgrave.</HI> In the third degree is the Marque&s;&s;e, or Marckgrave. The&s;e are the &s;peciall degrees and orders of Nobilitie, among which the government of every Countrie is divided. There are al&s;o &s;ome diffe|rences in the&s;e degrees which might occa&s;ion a &s;ubdivi&s;ion, but &s;uch as are di|&s;tingui&s;ht rather by priviledges than by forme of government. Yet moreover I will deliver the lawfull differences and conditions of every order which I have mentioned, as I have found them in a certaine <HI>French</HI> Booke, entituled <HI>La di|vi&s;ion du monde:</HI> deducing their creation from the lowe&s;t degree of Nobili|ty, whence their proprieties and order of government doe mo&s;t clearely appeare. A Knight, &s;aith this author, or a <HI>Chevalier</HI> &s;hall be thus created of one that was a Squire before, and bore armes in his E&s;cutcheon.

For no man can &s;et up a Colours or &s;tanderd of his owne, unle&s;&s;e hee can bring into the field at his owne charge a Troupe or Band at the lea&s;t of fiftie Gentle-men, who receive pay from him.

atchievements. Adde to this that which <HI>Paulus Aemilius</HI> witne&s;&s;eth, namely, that Dukes and Earles were in the beginning made Prefects by the King over Nations and Cities on this condition, onely that as often as there was occa&s;ion they &s;hould bee di&s;mi&s;&s;ed or changed. Now how could the afore &s;aid Lawes of creating Princes (which are mea&s;ured by, and doe claime the hereditarie po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion of Lands) be in force at that time, &s;eeing Dukedomes and Counties were conferr'd by Kings and Emperours as a temporary bountie? Therefore though the preci&s;e time of the In&s;titution of them cannot be &s;hewed (for that <HI>French</HI> Booke doth mention nothing of it) yet it is very likely, that under <HI>Otto</HI> the &s;e|cond Emperour, or about the yeare one thou&s;and, or a litle after, that manner of con&s;tituting and confirming dignities was ordained by the Monarches. For e|ven untill <HI>Otto</HI> the &s;econd, every Prince according to his power and ambition, did a&s;pire to greater dignitie and royall Maje&s;tie. So out of one Kingdome of <HI>Lotharingia</HI> or <HI>Lorreine,</HI> which being extended from the <HI>Rhene</HI> even to the River <HI>Scaldis,</HI> was bounded with the <HI>Frie&s;land</HI> Sea, and belonged to <HI>Lothari|us</HI> the Sonne of <HI>Lodovicus Pius,</HI> more Kingdomes did afterward ari&s;e, name|ly the <HI>transjurane Burgundie,</HI> which being extended from the Mountaine <HI>Jura</HI> even to the <HI>Alpes,</HI> did containe all <HI>Helvetia,</HI> the <HI>Rauraci,</HI> the <HI>Allobro|ges,</HI> and the <HI>transjurane Burgundians:</HI> and the Kingdome of <HI>Provence</HI> which did containe &s;ome part of <HI>Burgundie</HI> and <HI>Sabaudia,</HI> and was afterward called the Kingdome of <HI>Arelatum,</HI> of which at this day the Elector of <HI>Trevers</HI> is called the Archchancellour.

I omit the other Kingdomes which &s;prung up in that age by the de&s;ire and affectation of Soveraignty. But the Emperour <HI>Otto</HI> the &s;econd did divide <HI>Lotharingia,</HI> having tooke away the name of a Kingdome, into nine Dukedomes and Earledomes, as it were, into members pull'd and &s;eparated from the body, as <HI>Cu&s;pinian</HI> hath it, and having made a divi&s;ion thereof <HI>Anno 981,</HI> he fir&s;t made <HI>Charles</HI> the Brother of <HI>Lotharius</HI> King of <HI>France,</HI> Duke of that Countrie which is now called <HI>Lotharingia,</HI> as <HI>Richardus Wi&s;&s;enburgius</HI> doth &s;peake more at large. It &s;eemeth that after that time the arbitrarie erection and rai&s;ing of Kingdomes and Principalities did faile, the Monarches now contriving how to e&s;tabli&s;h a &s;etled Empire, which con&s;i&s;teth in the ju&s;t proportion and harmonie of its parts, as in man the parts of the body to the head. Therefore that &s;ome order might be perpetually kept in Principality and in government; I &s;uppo&s;e that at length about the &s;ame time which I mentioned before, the&s;e afore-&s;aid Lawes were devi&s;ed.

<HEAD>An Admonition concerning the u&s;e of the Tables following.</HEAD>

<P>Moreover thou &s;halt finde the degrees of Latitude and Longitude de&s;igned and &s;et forth on the &s;ides of the Tables, and for the mo&s;t <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> the degrees of Latitude on either &s;ide of the Table, and of Longitude on the top and bottome, &s;eeing according to the u&s;uall manner of Geo|graphers wee place the North on the higher part.

This foundation being laid, wee have followed the be&s;t de&s;criptions in delineating of Coun|tries, in which I had much helpe from a famous Mea&s;urer of Countries, and a mo&s;t diligent Geographer to the King of <HI>Spaine</HI> called <HI>Chri&s;ti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> Grothenius,</HI> who had viewed many Countries, and de&s;cribed them more largely and exactly than any other, and al&s;o from a mo&s;t diligent Geo|grapher

Tho&s;e who be&s;ides did helpe mee any thing at all, I will mention in due place, &s;o that Students may give them their de&s;erved prai&s;e, and I may not bee found ungratefull. And what&s;oever hath beene offerr'd mee by others, and I found out by my owne diligent &s;earch, I have compar'd together, that as neere as may bee I might &s;et forth accurate de&s;criptions: yet in one thing which I chiefly de&s;ired I am defective, namely in an exact numbring and reckoning up of Prin|cipalities &amp; Noble-mens places, which are much &s;ought for in Tables that are &s;et forth: therefore (READER) thou mu&s;t pardon that defect, and vouch&s;afe to helpe mee in de&s;cribing the Politicall Order of the Nobilitie, and in &s;hewing their places, names, and qualities, which will be an honour and grace unto thy name.

But if you have the di&s;tance from the North &s;ide, it will &s;hew you the Lati|tude in the Ea&s;t &s;ide. When the Meridians are not Parallels, the Lati|tude of a place &s;hall bee found out in the &s;ame manner, as in univer&s;all Tables, where the Parallels are circular, for the di&s;tance of the place taken from the next Parallel will &s;hew the &s;ame in the Ea&s;t &s;ide.

<P>The miles in divers Countries do differ much, therefore if you plea&s;e to compare them one to an other, bring them with your Compa&s;&s;es to the degrees of the Meridian, and then finde out how many miles are comprehended in one degree, and you &s;hall &s;ee how many miles of one countrie, and how many miles of an other countrie doe make up one degree; &s;o you &s;hall finde the common <HI>German</HI> miles (fifteene whereof are in one degree) foure times larger than the <HI>Italian</HI> miles, and double as much to the <HI>Swethi&s;h</HI> and <HI>We&s;tphalian</HI> miles.</P>

<P>And &s;o much concerning the <HI>French-mens</HI> Religion, now let us adde &s;omething concerning their cu&s;tomes and fa&s;hions: <HI>Livie</HI> te&s;tifies, that the <HI>French-men</HI> doe come to Councell in Armour; <HI>Strabo</HI> writeth, that it was the manner of the <HI>French</HI> Councels, that if any one did interrupt a Suiter, a publick Officer went to him, and drawing out his &s;word, did threaten him, and command him to keepe &s;ilence: and if hee did not then hold his peace, the Officer did in the &s;ame manner as formerly, the &s;econd and third time; and la&s;tly he cut off &s;o much of the Interrup|ters cloake, &s;o that the re&s;t was good for nothing: <HI>Cae&s;ar</HI> &s;aith, that the <HI>French-mens</HI> Councels are ra&s;h and &s;uddaine, and that they are uncon|&s;tant in Councell, and de&s;irous of innovation. The &s;ame <HI>Cae&s;ar</HI> noteth, that the <HI>French-men,</HI> when any matter of note happeneth, are wont by a &s;peedie way, to notifie it unto the Countries round about, and that is by acclamations and &s;houting with the voyce, for from them the others receive it, and they againe by the &s;ame meanes make it knowne to their neighbours. They doe not &s;uffer their Children (&s;aith <HI>Cae&s;ar</HI>) when they are growne to ripene&s;&s;e of yeares, to come unto them openly, be|cau&s;e they &s;hould not neglect the &s;ervice of the warres: and they thinke it an un&s;eemely thing for the Sonne in his Childehood to &s;it in publick in the &s;ight of his Father. The men doe make their wives a dowrie ac|cording to the portion which they receive with them, both which are put into one &s;tock, &s;o as that which ari&s;eth from it is kept to their u&s;e: and which &s;oever of the parties doth out-live the other, he or &s;hee hath both parts with the u&s;e and profit which hath ari&s;en from thence. The <HI>French</HI> women are beautifull, and like men for &s;trength and &s;tature, as <HI>Diodorus</HI> &s;aith; they are fruitfull, and when they bring forth children, they give them good education.

Moreover the tyde fol|loweth up into this River, even to <HI>Gandauum,</HI> which is thirty miles from the mouth of it, if you count them by the winding cour&s;e of the bankes. There doe come up into this River Sturgeons, Sal|mones, Troutes, great Lampreys, Turbotts, Congers, Cuckow fi&s;hes Mullets, Crabs, Lob&s;ters, Sardins, and many mo&s;t delicate fi&s;h, which come up out of the Sea into <HI>Scaldis,</HI> and doe there feede, and ca&s;t their &s;pawne; &s;o that for two or three monethes, betweene the Spring and the Summer, be&s;ides the greater fi&s;h, there is taken &s;o great a number of &s;mall Frie, that many men doe live by them. Al&s;o many Sea Dogfi&s;hes, and Porpoi&s;es doe come up this River, which two kind of fi&s;hes doe not ca&s;t forth any &s;pawne, but doe bring forth their young ones perfectly formed. The Dogfi&s;hes doe bring forth their young on the Land, and doe &s;uckle them with their dugges, untill they are growne to a good bigne&s;&s;e. Moreover, this River without the helpe of the Sea, doth yeeld divers kindes of fi&s;h all the yeere long, of which the&s;e are the chiefe: Pikes, Barbells, Tenches, Carpes and Breames of an unu&s;uall bigne&s;&s;e, &s;o that they doe &s;ome|times, weigh 20 pound; al&s;o Gudgeons, and many other kindes of fi&s;h both great and &s;mall.

And thus having &s;hewed the Rivers that are in the Low Countries, it remaineth that wee &s;hould &s;peake &s;omewhat concerning the Ocean: &s;eeing in regard it is &s;o neere unto it, it may be counted not only a member of this Province, but the chiefe head thereof. I &s;ay therefore that the Ocean is wide and large, and in rough weather, it is fearefull and terribly furious: for &s;ometimes when tempe&s;ts happen, the waves goe &s;o high, that
<PB N="432" REF="334">
it doth overflow and drowne whole Countries: and e&s;pecially it breaketh oftentimes in about the coa&s;t of <HI>Zeland:</HI> but the inhabitants doe ca&s;t up trenches and bankes, which do prevent the danger which might en&s;ue thereby: unle&s;&s;e when a we&s;terne winde doth contend and blow again&s;t the &s;pring tide. The windes which doe mo&s;t trou|ble the &s;ea, and thereby doe endanger the Countrie, are the North|we&s;t, the We&s;t and the South windes. Al&s;o it is much troubled at the New-Moone or Full-moone, and the two Aequinoctialls, at which time (as <HI>Cornelius Tacitus</HI> witne&s;&s;eth) the Sea doth &s;well very much. For every new Moone, and full Moone, wee &s;ee that there are &s;till the greate&s;t tides and greate&s;t tempe&s;ts. The&s;e tides doe produce &s;ome good, and &s;ome evill effects. As for the former, it pur|geth the water (as common experience doth teach us) and will not &s;uffer it to corrupt: and al&s;o it maketh &s;hips &s;ay le more &s;peedily. For as <HI>Vege&s;ius</HI> &s;aith, <HI>Lib.</HI> 4. concerning Military matters, <HI>Cap.</HI> 42. <HI>Hae|reciprocantis meatus ambiguitas cur&s;um Navium &s;ecunda adjuvat, re|tardat adver&s;a:</HI> that is, Tho&s;e tides if they be with a &s;hip, doe ha&s;ten her cour&s;e; but being again&s;t her doe fore&s;low and &s;tay her cour&s;e. The other evill effects, are the inundations, and violent irruptions of the Sea: For the Ocean doth &s;ometimes come up into the land with &s;uch violence, that it driveth backe great Rivers, and doth overflow &s;pacious fields, as we &s;ayd before. <HI>Pomponius Mela</HI> doth write as much, and the mi&s;erable experience of many ages doth con&s;ume it. But &s;o much concerning the&s;e things. And now having &s;poken of the Detriment and lo&s;&s;e, which &s;ome Countries of this Province doe receive by the Ocean, when it is rough and troubled, we mu&s;t &s;peake &s;omewhat of the commodities, which the whole Province doth reape by it, when it is quiet and peaceable, which commodities are &s;o many and &s;o great, that if they &s;hould want them, the Country could not &s;u&s;taine the halfe part of the inhabitants. And hence it comes to pa&s;&s;e, that this Province is as it were the Haven and Mart of all <HI>Europe,</HI> &s;o that there is an infinite multitude of Merchants and Factors, and as it were a confu&s;ed <HI>Chaos</HI> of inhabitants and forrei|ners. Be&s;ides, the Ocean bringeth many commodities to this Coun|try, as Herring fi&s;hing, and other fi&s;hings, which &s;erve not onely to &s;atisfie the voluptuous de&s;ires of the rich, but al&s;o to &s;u&s;taine the poore: and the inhabitants doe not onely get their foode, but all their wealth by it. For the over-plus of that which they take, doth furni&s;h a great part of <HI>France, Spaine, Germany, England,</HI> and other Coun|tries: yea great &s;tore of barreld &s;alt-fi&s;h is &s;ent even into <HI>Italy,</HI> e&s;pe|cially Salmones and Herrings. Now there are three kinds of fi&s;h which they &s;alt, namely Herrings, Codfi&s;h, and Salmones. But fir&s;t we will &s;peake of their Herring fi&s;hing of which they make a great commodity. Herrings are found in no River, nor in the <HI>Mediterrane|an</HI> Sea, nor the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> nor any other Sea, but onely in this Northerne Ocean: their bigne&s;&s;e, forme, and goodne&s;&s;e is &s;ufficiently knowne. And when they goe out of the Northerne Sea, which is alwayes in the Spring time, as if they fleeted from their owne native quarters, and went to &s;eeke &s;hady places, they come in &s;uch great &s;hoales, that
<PB N="433" REF="334">
no Nets can hold them, but that they breake through them, and do even darken the face of the Sea. And many broade bottom'd ve&s;&s;ells, which they call <HI>Bu&s;ses,</HI> are &s;et out from <HI>Holland, Frie&s;land, France, Brittaine,</HI> and <HI>Scotland;</HI> and doe all to avoyd contention, fi&s;h in &s;eve|rall parts, and quarters, either about <HI>England,</HI> or the Coa&s;ts of <HI>Scot|land,</HI> and the <HI>Orcades.</HI> The&s;e fi&s;hes are unbowelled alive if it may be (for a&s;&s;oone as they are out of the Sea waters they are dead) by one who hath good wages for doing it; and then another &s;alts them, and &s;o they are pre&s;ently barrelled up, and afterward &s;old; afterward the Herring men and Coupers doe &s;alt them anew, and take out the Pilchers which have no Milts nor Rowes, they are barrell'd up a|gaine with new pickle: afterward they are &s;urveyed by men &s;worne for that purpo&s;e, and &s;o &s;ealed up, in like manner as <HI>Diana's</HI> Prie&s;t did &s;eale up red Vermilion, as <HI>Galen</HI> witne&s;&s;eth. And the&s;e are the fir&s;t kind of Herrings which with <HI>Plautus</HI> we may call &s;alt or pickled Herrings: the other &s;ort are tho&s;e which are lightly &s;alted; and &s;o dryed in the &s;moake, being as yellow as gold, whence they call them <HI>Soretum,</HI> becau&s;e they call a red colour in their language <HI>Sorus.</HI> This Herrng fi&s;hing is very commodious and advantagious to the Com|monwealth of <HI>Holland</HI> and <HI>Zeland,</HI> &s;eeing not onely one Citty, but many Citties doe wholy depend and live on it, and the Citty and Country get their food by it, pay their debts, maintaine families, and doe get wealth by it. There is another &s;peciall kind of fi&s;h which they u&s;e to &s;alt, called in Latine <HI>A&s;cllus Major,</HI> or Cod-fi&s;h, thereby to difference it from that which is commonly ealled <HI>Caballian.</HI> It is a great fi&s;h, &s;o that &s;ome of them are three&s;core pound weight. It is taken at many times of the yeare, but e&s;pecially in Lent time, and chiefely in the <HI>Frie&s;land</HI> Sea, and great &s;tore of it is u&s;ually &s;alted up, whereby the whole country reapeth yeerely great profit. The third kind of &s;alt fi&s;h is Salmon: being very good when it is fre&s;h as well as &s;alted. <HI>Holland</HI> and <HI>Zeland</HI> have &s;tore of this kind of fi&s;h, in all moneths, but mo&s;t plentie in <HI>Aprill, May,</HI> and <HI>Iune:</HI> of which there is &s;uch great &s;tore &s;alted up, that the gaine which is made of them amounteth to 200000 crownes. But of the&s;e things enough, let us proceede to the re&s;t. The Low Countries are plaine and levell: there are few Hills in it, and fewer Mountaines, unle&s;&s;e it be in <HI>Lutzen|burg, Namurcum,</HI> and &s;ome parts of <HI>Hannonia,</HI> where they are very thicke, and there are many al&s;o in <HI>Leodium.</HI> It is every where beau|tified with Forre&s;ts and Woods, which both grace the Countrie, and afford much plea&s;ure in hunting. The Forre&s;t of <HI>Arden,</HI> in <HI>Iulius Cae&s;ars</HI> time, as he him&s;elfe writeth, was the greate&s;t of all <HI>France,</HI> running betweene the <HI>Treverians,</HI> from the River <HI>Rhene</HI> to the <HI>Ner|vians,</HI> and the <HI>Rhenicans,</HI> being above fifty miles long. And now at this time no wood in all <HI>France</HI> can be compared with it: but now there is a great part of it converted into arrable ground, &s;o that it is farre le&s;&s;er than it was: and that part which remaineth hath many glades made in it, which the husband men doe till, and call it by an|other name, but the greate&s;t part of it is from <HI>Theonis Villa</HI> even to <HI>Leodium,</HI> which is thirty miles in length. In the middle of it is

This Wood hath all kindes of plea&s;ant trees, which are very high, and broad-&s;preading, which afford both plea&s;ure and profit. <HI>Strabo</HI> calleth it <HI>Arduenna,</HI> the Inhabitants <HI>Arddenna; Rhenanus, Luitticherwald,</HI> which &s;ignifies the <HI>Leodien&s;ian</HI> Wood. <HI>Mormavia,</HI> or <HI>Mormau,</HI> is a faire wood in <HI>Hannonia,</HI> which beginneth neere to <HI>Que&s;noy,</HI> and &s;o runneth out Southward toward the <HI>Veromanduans:</HI> and hath many Townes in it, and Villages, and many cleare &s;prings and plea&s;ant Fountaines.

But &s;o much concer|ning the woods. I come now to the publick works. There are in the&s;e Countries innumerable magnificent Temples, and Churches, many Abbies, infinite numbers of Mona&s;teries, &amp; Friaries, many Ho&s;pitalls for &s;trangers, for the &s;ick, for the poore &amp; for Orphans. Truly in <HI>Ant|werp</HI> only there are 42 &s;uch like buildings: the chiefe of which is the Cathedral Church of S. <HI>Mary,</HI> which is very &s;pacious, having a Tow|er Steeple, which is 400 &amp; 20 foote high, being built of white Mar|ble, from the top whereof you may view the Cittie, the River cove|red with &s;hips, and the Countrie round about which is full of Townes and Citties. What &s;hould I de&s;cribe the other Temples, Mona&s;te|ries, and &s;uch like places, of which there are great &s;tore both heere and in other Citties and Townes? What &s;hould I reckon up the &s;umptuous Pallaces belonging to Dukes, Earles, and Noblemen? Or what &s;hould I mention the other publicke or private buildings? for if I &s;hould endeavour to reckon them up, I &s;hould &s;ooner want time than matter; wherefore it is better to be &s;ilent, than to &s;peake too &s;pa|ringly. The politick &s;tate of the&s;e Countries both in generall and &s;pe|ciall is threefold: the fir&s;t is the Eccle&s;ia&s;tick &s;tate, in which the Ab|bots are the chiefe, the &s;econd is of the Nobility, as the Duks, Earles, Marcgraves, Princes, Barrons, and great Lords. The third is of the Citties, which the chiefe Citties of every Country doe repre&s;ent. The&s;e &s;tates the Prince calleth together, when they are to con&s;ult concerning matters appertaining to the Prince, or to the Principality, or to the pre&s;ervation or utility of the Countrie. The Eccle&s;ia&s;ticke &s;tate is thus; there are foure Bi&s;hops in the Low Countries, the <HI>Camaracen&s;ian,</HI> the <HI>Tornaycen&s;ian,</HI> and the <HI>Atrebate<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;ian:</HI> the&s;e three are under the Arch-bi&s;hop of <HI>Rhemes,</HI> and the <HI>Vltrajectine</HI> who is under the Arch-bi&s;hop of <HI>Colen.</HI> I proceed to the Vniver&s;ities, which are 4, the Vniver&s;itie of <HI>Lovaine,</HI> and <HI>Doway,</HI> of <HI>Leyden,</HI> and <HI>Flankford. Lovaine</HI> is famous for the many Colledges, Students, and learned men; the chiefe Colledges are <HI>Lilium, Ca&s;tren&s;e,</HI> the Col|ledge of <HI>Porus</HI> and <HI>Falcon,</HI> in which Philo&s;ophie is read. The <HI>Bu&s;|lidian</HI> Colledge hath three languages taught in it, namely, Greeke, Latine, and Hebrew. This Vniver&s;itie, at the reque&s;t of the No|bles of <HI>Brabant,</HI> was fir&s;t in&s;tituted and adorned with Priviledges by <HI>Iohn</HI> the 4, Duke of <HI>Brabant,</HI> in the yeare 1426. <HI>Martinus</HI> the fifth being Pope. The other were erected in our memory. Out of which as it were out of the <HI>Troian</HI> hor&s;e innumerable learned men have proceeded, and doe dayly come from thence. For in the Low
<PB N="436" REF="336">
Countries there are learned men, skilfull in all faculties and &s;ciences: and as heretofore, &s;o now it produceth famous Schollers; whom it would be too tedious to reckon up. Here are divers Libraries in &s;un|dry places, which are repleni&s;hed with excellent rare Bookes. A|mong which that at <HI>Leyden</HI> is the chiefe. The inhabitants are faire, quiet, not cholericke, nor ambitious, nor proud: not much given to venerie; civill, plaine, curteous, affable, ingenious and ready, witty, and &s;ometimes talkative: laborious, indu&s;trious, faithfull, gratefull towards tho&s;e that have done them a curte&s;ie, capable of all Arts and Sciences, &s;tout in defending their liberties, and Priviledges even to death. And this may truely be &s;poken in the generall pray&s;e of them, that the Low Country men are frugall hou&s;e keepers and thrifty hu&s;|bands: who following the example of the Ant, do lay up before win|ter, that which cannot then be gotten; and doe buy fi&s;h and fle&s;h, which they either pickle up, or doe dry it in the &s;moake. For every hou&s;e, according to the number of their familie, doth kill in Autumne an whole Oxe, or provideth halfe an one, be&s;ide a Hogge, which they &s;alt up, and then it will &s;erve them to &s;pend a good part of the yeare, untill the Spring returne againe. Yet many of them are very co|vetous, and de&s;irous of wealth. The Women are beautifull, well be|hav'd and curteous. For according to their Country fa&s;hion, they are u&s;ed from their childhood to conver&s;e familiarly with every one: and therefore they are very ready both in action or &s;peech or any mat|ter: neither doth this freedome or liberty make them le&s;&s;e hone&s;t. Neither doe they onely walke alone through the Cittie, but they will goe for fellow&s;hip to the next Townes, without any the lea&s;t &s;u&s;pition of di&s;hone&s;tie. They are very continent, and apt and ready in their affaires And they are not onely carefull of hou&s;hold matters, of which their husbands take no care, but they al&s;o u&s;e Merchandi&s;e, and di&s;patch and conferre of bu&s;ine&s;&s;es belonging unto men: and that with &s;o great dexterity and diligence, that in many of the Pro|vinces, as in <HI>Holland</HI> and <HI>Zeland,</HI> the men do commit all their affaires unto them. And by this manner of living, joyned with the innate de&s;ire which women have to rule, they become for the mo&s;t part too Imperious and proud. It is the fa&s;hion both among Princes, and men of inferior ranke, as al&s;o among other Nations, on this &s;ide the <HI>Alpes,</HI> to give the fir&s;t born their Parents names, althogh they be yet living. And the Noble of what quality and condition &s;oever they are, doe more e&s;teeme of their elde&s;t daughter, than the re&s;t of the younger, although they have all an equall dowry: &s;o that they marry the re&s;t to tho&s;e unto whom they denyed her in marriage, re&s;erving her for a better husband. And they are to be pray&s;ed, becau&s;e they ea&s;ily contract marriages with forrainers, if occa&s;ion &s;o require, and are not bound to match them in their owne Country, which is a matter ve|ry profitable and commodious: for the&s;e alliances by marriage are very advantagious to them&s;elves and the Commonwealth. More|over it is accounted undecent and ab&s;ur'd, for young men to marry old women, or on the contrary for old men to marry young maydes: as al&s;o for a noble per&s;onage to marry an ignoble per&s;on, or a ma&s;ter
<PB N="437" REF="336">
to marry his Maide, and a Mi&s;tre&s;&s;e her &s;ervant. But the Low Coun|try men are chiefely given to Mechanicke Arts, but not of the ba&s;e and &s;ervile &s;ort, but the more nobler, as weaving, clothing, and ma|king of hangings, &amp; tape&s;try, which &s;erve not only for the u&s;e of their owne country: but are al&s;o tran&s;ported into <HI>France, Spaine, Germany,</HI> and other parts of <HI>Europe,</HI> and al&s;o into <HI>A&s;ia</HI> and <HI>Affricke.</HI> For Pi|ctures, there is no Nation that doth excell it, nor none doth excell in Mu&s;icke, or for variety of Languages. <HI>Iohn Eickius</HI> a Low country|man, did fir&s;t &s;hew the way how to mingle colours with oyle. And every one in <HI>Flanders, Brabant,</HI> or <HI>Zeland,</HI> can &s;peake not onely their owne Country &s;peech which is Low-Dutch, but al&s;o <HI>French.</HI> The Sea men, Merchants, and Schollers, can &s;peake al&s;o <HI>Italian, Spani&s;h,</HI> and <HI>Greeke</HI> for the mo&s;t part: and &s;ome can under&s;tand <HI>Hebrew,</HI> the <HI>Chaldean,</HI> and <HI>Arabicke</HI> language. The Lowcountrie men are al&s;o skilfull Seamen. I come to their food, the Lowcountry men doe u&s;e Wheate, Rye, Oates, and Barly: they e&s;teeme of no pul&s;e but Beanes, and Pea&s;e: they have few Vetches and no Millet at all. For the great &s;trong windes doe lay it, and &s;poyle it. The Com|mon people maintaine their families &s;oberly and frugally. Their drinke is for the mo&s;t part Beere, which is made of Malt, into which they afterward put &s;ome ground Barly, and Hops. And this is a very good and whole&s;ome drinke for tho&s;e that are u&s;ed to it; they doe al&s;o drinke much milke. The rich have wine. They eate commonly Rye bread. They are wont al&s;o upon Fe&s;tivall dayes, e&s;pecially tho&s;e which beare their owne name, to make great fea&s;ts, and to invite their Parents, Kin&s;emen, and friends unto them, and to banquet &s;umptuou&s;ly with them, and to &s;hew them&s;elves generous and magnificent. They keepe their hou&s;es very neate and cleane, being furni&s;hed with all kinds of nece&s;&s;ary hou&s;hold &s;tuffe. And truly it is a faire &s;ight to &s;ee what &s;tore of hou&s;hold&s;tuffe they have, and how well ordered it is, and how cleane it is kept; in which, with|out doubt it doth excell all the Nations of the World. But the Low Countriemen are too much given to the Vice of drinking, in which they take great delight, &s;o that oftentimes they never give over drin|king day nor night; and thereby be&s;ides other inconveniences, they do much wrong their bodyes and witts: and without doubt it is often|times the cau&s;e of their untimely death, according to that of <HI>Properti|us:</HI> <Q><L>Vino forma perit, vino corrumpitur aetas.</L>

For &s;eeing the ayre is alwayes moy&s;t and melancholy: they have no other meanes whereby to cure their hatefull, and unwhol&s;ome Melancholy: which <HI>Horace</HI> &s;eemeth to intimate, &s;aying: <HI>Vino pellite curas,</HI> that is;

There are divers uncertaine conjectures concerning the originall thereof; but this is manife&s;t, that in one of the letters Pattents of <HI>Pepin</HI> King of <HI>France,</HI> dated in the yeare 753, there is mention made of it, and that it is there called <HI>Ma&s;tinas,</HI> as it were the line of the Sea, becau&s;e the Sea doth flow and ebbe before it; which Etymologie plea&s;eth &s;ome better, than to call it <HI>Machel</HI> from one <HI>Michael</HI> who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the&s;e parts, as <HI>Ortelius</HI> doth deliver in his Itinerarie of the Low Countries. Others doe deduce the name from other derivations. But as we &s;ayd, <HI>Mach|lin,</HI> after the yeare 753, had <HI>Adon</HI> to be Earle thereof, which he held by fealty and &s;ervice. But who were his Praedece&s;&s;ors, or &s;ucce&s;&s;ors is not yet knowne. Long time afterward there follow'd the <HI>Sertol|di,</HI> who denyed fealty and homage to <HI>Godfrey Barbatus,</HI> Duke of <HI>Brabant,</HI> which occa&s;ioned warres betweene them. After the <HI>Berl|toldi, Machlin</HI> had various fortunes, and divers Lords; at length it recovered libertie, and was not &s;ubject unto any in the yeare 1336. And afterward it came to the <HI>Burgundian</HI> family in the yeare 1383. And la&s;tly, unto the <HI>Au&s;trian</HI> family, in the yeare 1477. And it is now one of the 17 Provinces of the Low countries, where the chiefe Coun&s;ell doth &s;it, whither the la&s;t appeale in the Low Countries is made; &amp; in&s;tituted by <HI>Charles</HI> of <HI>Burgundie,</HI> Prince of the Low Coun|tries, and at length in our time it was made an Archbi&s;hopricke, the chiefe Metropolitan &s;eate, whereof is Saint <HI>Rumolds</HI> Church. Be&s;ides, there is an Armorie in it, which in the yeare of Chri&s;t, 1546. in the moneth of <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> the Gunpowder being &s;et on fire by lightning, was burnt downe, and the Cittie much defaced thereby.</P>

<P>_THus you have &s;eene the de&s;cription of the Low coutrie both in generall and &s;peciall: now pa&s;&s;ing over the <HI>Rhene</HI> high <HI>Germanie,</HI> which <HI>Ptolemie</HI> calls great <HI>Germanie,</HI> of|fers it &s;elfe, which is the large&s;t Country of <HI>Europe,</HI> and the glory of the Romaine Empire.

Some doe &s;uppo&s;e their denomination doth intimate that they were a warlike people de&s;irous of warre, from <HI>Gerra,</HI> or <HI>Guerra,</HI> which &s;ignifies warre.

from the great <HI>Deluge,</HI> which drowned all the world: when <HI>Noah</HI> parted the world among his three children: at what time (that I may &s;peake nothing of <HI>Sem</HI> and <HI>Cham) Europe</HI> fell to <HI>Iaphets</HI> &s;hare.

Some al&s;o doe call this part of <HI>Europe Alemaine,</HI> and the inhabitants thereof <HI>Ale|mans,</HI> by which name they were fir&s;t called, when the Empire began to decline. <HI>Bero&s;us</HI> doth fabulou&s;ly report, it was &s;o called from <HI>Her|cules</HI> an <HI>Alemaine,</HI> who was governour over the&s;e people. Some &s;uppo&s;e that it was called <HI>Alemaine,</HI> from <HI>Mannus</HI> who was e&s;tee|med as a god in their Country, the &s;onne of <HI>Tui&s;con.

And though &s;ome do promi&s;cuou&s;ly make <HI>Germanie</HI> &amp; <HI>Almany</HI> al one, yet it is ob&s;erved that they were two di&s;tinct Coun|tries. <HI>Spartianus</HI> in the life of <HI>Marius</HI> &s;aith: <HI>Omnis Alemannia, om|ni&s;que Germania, cum caeteris quae adjacent gentibus;</HI> that is, All <HI>Alma|ny,</HI> and <HI>Germany</HI> with the other adjacent countries. <HI>Flavius Vopi&s;cus</HI> &s;aith in the lif of <HI>Probus: Te&s;tes &s;unt Franci, inuijs &s;trati paludibus, te&s;tes Germani &amp; Alemanni, longe a Rheni &s;emoti littoribus,</HI> that is, The <HI>Frenchmen</HI> are witne&s;&s;es, who dwell in the Low grounds, the <HI>Ger|maines</HI> are witne&s;&s;es, and the <HI>Almaines</HI> who are farre off from the &s;hoares of <HI>Rhene.</HI> I omit other te&s;timonies, lea&s;t I &s;hould be tedious.

Be&s;ides, authors doe not agree in de&s;igning and &s;etting downe the limits of <HI>Germanie.</HI> The auncients doe bounder <HI>Germany</HI> with the <HI>Rhene, Danubius,</HI> the Ocean, the Ri|ver <HI>Tanais</HI> and the <HI>Euxine</HI> Sea. The latter writers, as <HI>Strab<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, Pto|lemie, Mela, Plinnie,</HI> and many other Greeke and Latine writers, doe bounder it with the River <HI>Rhene</HI> and <HI>Ve&s;tula.

And this is the Rea&s;on, that on one of the banckes of <HI>Rhene,</HI> there are many old Cities, but none on the other: which may al&s;o be ob&s;erved on the bancke of <HI>Danubius.

The &s;ituation being declared, the qualitie of the &s;oyle followeth, which ari&s;eth chiefe|ly from the climate and po&s;ition thereof in re&s;pect of the hea|vens. <HI>Germany</HI> is under the &s;ixt, &s;eaventh, and eighth climates, betweene the fourtie &s;eaventh and fiftie five degrees of Latitude, and the twentie fourth and forty &s;ixth degrees of Longitude. The longe&s;t day in &s;ommer in the Southerne parallel is fifteene houres long and an halfe: in the Northerne Parallel, it is &s;eaventeene houres long and a quarter; and albeit <HI>Cornelius Tacitus</HI> &s;aith, that <HI>Ger|many</HI> is in a cold &s;harpe climate, and <HI>Seneca</HI> reporteth that it is alwayes winter in <HI>Germanie:</HI> yet it hath a temperate ayre, which though it bee &s;omewhat cold, yet it is healthfull and whole|&s;ome.</P>
<P>The &s;oyle yeeldeth Barly, Wheate, Rye, Mill, Oates, and o|ther kindes of corne and pul&s;e.

There are al&s;o many excellent Salt pitts. <HI>Plinnie</HI> al&s;o &s;aith, the Cadmian &s;tones, the Callais, the Cry&s;tall, the Onyx, the Topaz, and the Adamant; are found in <HI>Germanie.</HI> Al&s;o the hearbes. Heere are a thou&s;and delightfull gardens, and Villages, and Orchards full of Apples.</P>
<P>What, &s;hould I mention the wines? which are of an excellent ta&s;te and colour? Truely there are excellent wines every where, but yet in &s;ome places better than in others. Heere is al&s;o great variety of living creatures, and great &s;toare of Cattell and wilde bea&s;ts, which I will not &s;pend time to reckon up. <HI>C. Iulius Cae|&s;ar</HI> writeth, that many kindes of wilde bea&s;ts are bred in the Wood <HI>Hercynia,</HI> which are not &s;eene in any other place; of which (&s;aith hee) tho&s;e that differ mo&s;t from the re&s;t, and are mo&s;t worthy of remembrance are the&s;e: there is a kinde of Oxe which is like a Hart, which hath in the middle of his forehead one high horne, and more &s;traite than u&s;uall, from the toppe whereof large Antletts or Tines doe &s;pread forth; the male and femall are of one &s;hape, and have one as bigge hornes as the other. There is al&s;o a bea&s;t called Alcis, which is like unto a Goate, but it is &s;omewhat bigger, and having no hornes at all, and their legges are without joynts, &s;o that they cannot by any meanes lye downe to their re&s;t, or if they fall downe by chance, they cannot ri&s;e up againe; therefore they leane again&s;t trees, and &s;o they take their re&s;t: and when the hunters have found by their
<PB N="522" REF="389">
footing where they u&s;ually haunt, they either &s;tub up all the trees, or el&s;e they cut them halfe downe, and &s;o leave them &s;tanding: So that when the bea&s;ts re&s;t again&s;t them according to their u&s;uall manner, they overthrow the trees with their weight, and &s;o fall downe with them. The third kind of bea&s;ts are tho&s;e which are called <HI>Vri,</HI> which are almo&s;t as bigge as Elephants, and like Bulls in &s;hape and colour&punc; they are very &s;trong, and &s;wift, and will prey on men and bea&s;ts: the&s;e they u&s;ually take in trappes, and &s;o kill them. But now I come to the auncient government. The &s;acred Romaine Empire, which being divided into the We&s;t and Ea&s;terne part, was much weakned by the excur&s;ions of divers Nations, and rent by civill di&s;&s;entions, was ready to be ruined by its owne weight; having for&s;ooke <HI>Italie</HI> did &s;eeke defence and &s;trength in no other Countrie but <HI>Germanie,</HI> and cho&s;e <HI>Charles</HI> the Great King of <HI>France</HI> to be Emperour, who as they report, was borne at <HI>Ingelheimij,</HI> which is a village Towre two miles from <HI>Moguntiacum,</HI> and built there a famous Pallace, who&s;e ruines may be yet &s;eene. The Empire remained in <HI>Charles</HI> his line an hundred yeares, and above: which afterward failing, it was tran|&s;lated to <HI>Conrade</HI> Duke of <HI>Franconia:</HI> after whom followed <HI>Henry Fowler:</HI> after him the three <HI>Ottoes:</HI> the la&s;t whereof when he un|der&s;tood that the <HI>Romaines, Cre&s;centius</HI> being con&s;ull, did affect and de&s;ire the title of the Empire, he ray&s;ed an army and tooke <HI>Rome,</HI> and obtayned of Pope <HI>Gregorie,</HI> that the <HI>Germaines</HI> &s;hould have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ight and power to elect the <HI>Romaine</HI> Emperours.

It is manife&s;t that the Moone is the cau&s;e of the tides of the Ocean. But as the Moone hath divers chan|ges in her motion, &s;o the tides doe al&s;o change. For they following the Moone, doe flow twice betweene the ri&s;ing thereof, and doe ebbe twice in foure and twentie houres: &s;o that the Seas doe flow twice, and ebbe twice every day: they flow when the Moone a&s;cen|deth above the Ea&s;terne <HI>Horizon,</HI> and do ebb when it declineth from the <HI>Meridian</HI> we&s;tward; and it floweth againe when the Moone goeth downe under the earth, and commeth to the contrary part of the <HI>Me|ridian,</HI> and &s;o likewi&s;e it ebbeth untill it ri&s;e againe. But as the Moone does not alwayes ri&s;e at one time, and in one place, but every day ri|&s;eth in another place than it did before: &s;o the tides doe not flow at certaine houres, but at that time when the Moone pa&s;&s;eth through the Poles of the heavens. Moreover it is to bee noted, that the full Moone doth move the Sea in another manner than the halfe Moone. For this <HI>Luminarie</HI> hath greater force when it is at the full, than when it is weake, and in the waine.

But if the Moon be in &s;ignes of a right a&s;cen&s;ion, it maketh the tides longer than if it were in &s;ignes of oblique a&s;cen&s;ion: for it is ob&s;erved that the tides are ne|ver equall to the ebbes in continuance of time; but when the Moone is in the <HI>Equinoctiall</HI> &s;ignes and hath no Latitude. Be&s;ides, &s;ome parts of the water doe finde a greater influence proceeding from the beames of the bodie of the Moone, either in regard of the rectitude and &s;traightne&s;&s;e of the beames, or &s;ome other hidden qualitie. But the Moone hath a different influence when it is Northward, and ano|ther when it is Southward; for when it is heere it encrea&s;es the tides on the Southerne &s;hoares, and when it is there, on the Northerne &s;hoa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">es. Moreover the Tides of the Sea are greater in &s;ome places, and in other places very &s;mall or none at all. For as concerning this our <HI>Germaine</HI> Sea, it is certaine that there are &s;carce any tides which can be perceived, but as the Sea is carried with the windes, it &s;oweth now here and now there: for when it is an Ea&s;t wind, the Sea goeth very high, and driveth backe Rivers, neither doth it flow onely <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> the Sea &s;ide, but it overflowes the Land. And whereas the Spa|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">h and <HI>Atlanticke</HI> Ocean is of an un&s;earchable deapth, &s;o that a line of three hundred or foure hundred fathom cannot &s;ound the bottome of it, yet the <HI>Germaine</HI> Sea, in the mo&s;t parts is but 60.

is worthy to be mentioned, that whereas all other Seas are bitter and &s;alt, our Sea hath &s;weete waters and not unplea&s;ant to drinke, and that in regard that many great fre&s;h Rivers doe runne into it out of the <HI>Sarmatian</HI> Mountaines, and becau&s;e the Sunne is too weake in tho&s;e places to exhale and draw up the lighter and thinner parts of the water, which &s;ome make to bee the chiefe cau&s;e of the &s;altne&s;&s;e of the Sea. Which rea&s;on if it were good and probable, then the <HI>Amalchian</HI> Sea al&s;o, and the <HI>Chronian</HI> Sea &s;hould not be &s;alt, which is otherwi&s;e. Wherefore it is rather to be held that the melted &s;now, and the afore&s;ayd Rivers flowing downe out of the <HI>Sarmatian</HI> Moun|taines, doe make this Sea cleere and &s;weete. Whereby it comes to pa&s;&s;e, that other Seas doe more ea&s;ily carry ve&s;&s;ells of great burden, than this. And the rea&s;on is becau&s;e the water of the &s;alt Sea is of a thicker &s;ub&s;tance, while the thinner waters doe yeeld to the lea&s;t waight. It is ea&s;ier al&s;o to &s;wim in this Sea than in others. Yet it maketh Sea men more &s;icke, in regard the waves got very high, &s;o that &s;ometimes they &s;eeme to touch the Clouds, and then fall againe and breake into deepe valleyes. This Sea in divers places, hath di|vers appellations, or names; For &s;ometimes it is called the <HI>Germaine</HI> Ocean, from <HI>Germanie</HI> which is neere unto it, and it reacheth from the <HI>French,</HI> and <HI>Britti&s;h</HI> Sea, which lyeth We&s;tward, even to <HI>Sarma|tia</HI> in the Ea&s;t. It is al&s;o called the Northerne Sea, the <HI>Cimbrian</HI> Sea, the <HI>Balthick,</HI> the <HI>Codanian,</HI> the <HI>Suevian</HI> Sea, &amp;c. And &s;o much con|cerning the Sea.

Now I come to their manners. All Authors doe report that the <HI>Ger|maines</HI> are &s;trong, and of a great &s;tature. <HI>Tacitus</HI> &s;aith they are gray eyde, red haird, large bodyed, and very &s;trong. <HI>Hege&s;ippus</HI> and <HI>Plin|ny</HI> doe call them great men: <HI>Sidonius</HI> calleth them cruell and fierce, <HI>Pau&s;anias</HI> and <HI>C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;siodorus</HI> calleth them proud: <HI>Appianus,</HI> ungentle, <HI>Cae&s;ar</HI> calleth them barbarous, treacherous, and di&s;&s;emblers: <HI>Pater|culus</HI> &s;aith that they are very crafty, and are naturally given to lye. But <HI>Tacitus</HI> who lived among&s;t them &s;aith, that the &s;ouldiers are very couragious, and that it is a warlike Nation, but are neither cunning nor crafty, but doe di&s;cover their owne mindes and &s;ecrets, and very faithfull in keeping &s;ecrets committed to them. Al&s;o the Emperour <HI>Iulianus</HI> in his <HI>Mi&s;opogne</HI> &s;aith, that hee knoweth by experience that this Nation cannot flatter, but that they deale freely and plaine|ly with all men. <HI>Ptolemy,</HI> 11. <HI>Quadrip.</HI> &s;aith, that they mu&s;t needes be of a quiet and peaceable di&s;po&s;ition, in regard of the qualitie of the Countrie which they inhabit. Concerning their religion, where|by the mindes of men are held and bound together by the tye and feare of &s;ome Deity, the <HI>Germaines</HI> (as <HI>Cae&s;ar</HI> writeth) doe u&s;e no &s;acri|fices, they account them onely to be gods whom they &s;ee, and from whom they receive &s;ome benefit: as the Sunne, and <HI>Vulcan,</HI> and the Moone. But afterward, as it appeareth in <HI>Tacitus,</HI> who lived under the reigne of the Emperour <HI>Nerva;</HI> they had many other gods: as <HI>Mercury, Hercules, Mars, I&s;is,</HI> and <HI>Berecinthia:</HI> al&s;o a certaine god called <HI>Alcis.</HI> The &s;ame <HI>Tacitus</HI> doth report al&s;o that <HI>Velleda</HI> and <HI>Au|rinia</HI> were accounted as Gods. And the afore&s;aid <HI>Tacitus</HI> maketh mention of the Temple of <HI>Tanfana,</HI> who &s;aith that the <HI>Suevians</HI> doe reverence the mother Earth, which they call (as <HI>L<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">p&s;ius</HI> &s;aith) <HI>Aer|tha.</HI> But <HI>Plutarch</HI> and <HI>Clemens Alexandrinus</HI> doe affirme that they had no Images in their Temples, but certaine holy women, which <HI>Tacitus</HI> calleth Sooth&s;ayers, and <HI>Agathias,</HI> and <HI>Polyoenus</HI> doe call them Prophete&s;&s;es, who did foretell future events, by the &s;ound, and cour&s;es of Rivers. <HI>Amilianus</HI> doth note, that they doe foretell things to come, by the flight of birds, by the in&s;pection of entralls, and all other &s;ignes. But they did chiefely reverence <HI>Mercury</HI> or <HI>Teutates,</HI> and offered humaine &s;acrifices thereunto, as <HI>Tacitus</HI> wit|ne&s;&s;eth. In the time of peace there was no common Magi&s;trate, but in the time of warre they did chu&s;e Governours. They &s;pent all their life time in military affaires: and to rob was accounted no di&s;grace, as we may reade in <HI>Cae&s;ar. Seneca</HI> &s;aith, that their chiefe delight was the warres in which they were both borne and bread. If (as <HI>Tacitus</HI> witne&s;&s;eth) they have peace any long time together at home in their owne Country, then they goe to the warres in other Nations. They cary about with them their mothers, wives, and children, who doe carry their knap&s;ackes, and provi&s;ion: neither are they afraide of plagues. They joyne battell with &s;ongs and warlike &s;ounds. They count it a great di&s;grace to lo&s;e their buckler in the field, &s;o that many after the battle for griefe thereof have hang'd them&s;elves. <HI>Dion</HI> and <HI>Herodotus</HI> do report; that they will march over Rivers in regard they are lightly armed, and of an high &s;tature.

But as to man or Nation is without &s;ome vice, &s;o they count it no &s;hame to drinke night and day. Concerning their habit, <HI>Tacitus</HI> &s;aith that they all weare a kinde of Cloake button'd before, which loo&s;ely hangeth over their &s;houlders: the &s;ame <HI>Tacitus</HI> &s;aith, that the <HI>Germaines</HI> did not weare a loo&s;e garment but a &s;traite bodyed garment, &s;uch as <HI>Si|donius</HI> &s;aith the <HI>French</HI> did u&s;e.

<P>But provident nature hath given the <HI>Frie&s;landers,</HI> and <HI>Hollanders</HI> in&s;teed of wood, a certaine kind of turffe, which being digged out of the earth, and dryed in the winde and Sunne, doth burne very well, which is a better fuell than that which the <HI>Scythians</HI> u&s;ed, who wan|ting wood did burne bones, and kept fire with them. And there is &s;o great plenty of this turffe, as that it doth not onely &s;erve the inhabi|tants, but al&s;o other neighbour Countries. There are diver&s;e kindes of it, which doe differ in colour, lightne&s;&s;e, and the whitene&s;&s;e of their a&s;hes.

Henry</HI> the fourth did much impo|veri&s;h this Cittie by laying a taxation of Tenthes upon it, having al|waies enjoyed a freedome &amp; immunitie from &s;uch impo&s;itions. So that when the <HI>Saxon</HI> warre began, they cho&s;e rather to defend their aunci|ent libertie with the &s;word, than to &s;ubmit unto the Vniver&s;all taxation of Tenthes; and that with &s;o great courage, that they brought <HI>Augu&s;tus</HI> to a great &s;traite. This Cittie as if fortune an enemie to greatne&s;&s;e, meant to triumph over it, was of|tentimes burnt, &s;o that no other great Cittie in <HI>Germany,</HI> was ever burnt &s;o often as this: the la&s;t time that it was burnt, which was in the yeare 1472, it &s;u&s;tained much lo&s;&s;e, e&s;pecially in the Churches of the Virgin <HI>Marie</HI> and <HI>Severus,</HI> &s;o that a third part almo&s;t of the Cittie was burned downe.

The Senate giving way to the tumultuous furie of the peo+ple, endeavoured to appea&s;e them with faire and gentle words, telling them, that in convenient time they would bring in an account of their receipts and expen&s;es; which words quieted the Cittizens for a while. But when the day appointed came, they a&s;&s;embled them&s;elves together, and de&s;ired the Senate to bring in their account. But then one more in&s;olent than the re&s;t, &s;poke &s;harpely unto tho&s;e whom the Cittizens had &s;ent to the Senate, which did much provoke and exa&s;|perate the Cittizens.

But <HI>Nortgovia,</HI> that we may begin with the Etymologie, was &s;o named becau&s;e it is a Northerne Countrie. For <HI>Nort</HI> in the <HI>Germanie</HI> language &s;ignifies North, and <HI>Gow</HI> &s;ignifies a Land or Countrie. Moreover this Countrie is called the higher <HI>Palatinate</HI> to di&s;tingui&s;h it, from the <HI>Palatinate</HI> of <HI>Rhine,</HI> which is called the Lower. This <HI>Bavaria</HI> was heretofore called <HI>Nori|cum,</HI> which <HI>Ptolomie</HI> bounders with the River <HI>Aenus,</HI> and part of <HI>Da|nubius,</HI> which runneth from <HI>Aenus</HI> to the Mountaine <HI>Cetius;</HI> al&s;o with the Mountaine <HI>Cetius,</HI> and with part of <HI>Pannonia,</HI> and the Moun|taine <HI>Catrancas.</HI> But after that the <HI>Bojans</HI> having driven out the <HI>Ro|manes,</HI> did tran&s;migrate and remoove into that part of <HI>Vindelitia,</HI> which lyeth betweene <HI>Aenus</HI> and <HI>Lycus,</HI> this tract al&s;o began to bee called <HI>Noricum, Bojaria,</HI> or <HI>Bavaria.</HI> For &s;o the third Deacon of <HI>Lumber|die,</HI> as M. <HI>Vel&s;erus</HI> intimateth in his letters to <HI>Ortelius,</HI> doth de&s;cribe it in the&s;e words. <HI>Noricum</HI> which is a Province of the <HI>Bojans,</HI> hath on the Ea&s;t <HI>Pannonia,</HI> on the We&s;t <HI>Swethland,</HI> on the South <HI>Italie,</HI> on the North the River <HI>Danubius.

Neere to <HI>Kelheime</HI> there are many Vines growing on the bancke of <HI>Danubius.</HI> But they yeeld a kind of hard &s;harpe Wine, &s;o that it is a common &s;aying that Vinegar growes on tho&s;e Mountaines. In other places al&s;o it produces divers kindes of mettalls, e&s;pecially great &s;tore of Iron, of which the <HI>Nortgovians</HI> doe yearely make a great gaine and commoditie. There is al&s;o an excellent kinde of blew colour, which they call <HI>Lazurus.</HI> Moreover <HI>Noricum,</HI> which is now the <HI>Palatinate</HI> of <HI>Bavaria,</HI> was heretofore a Kingdome, and had Kings of its owne, when the <HI>Romanes</HI> had reduc'd the other part of <HI>Bavaria</HI> into a Pro|vince even till the yeare of our Lord 500: whence <HI>Iulius Cae&s;ar</HI> in his Commentaries, mentioneth that <HI>Arivov<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;tus</HI> King of <HI>Ger|manie,</HI> married the King of <HI>Noricums</HI> Si&s;ter. But what Princes the <HI>Noricians</HI> had afterward doth not appeare, untill they became Chri&s;ti|ans. But in the yeare 511, by the labour and indu&s;trie of <HI>Theoden</HI> the &s;econd, <HI>Bavaria</HI> was reduc'd into one Kingdome, who made a great &s;laughter on the <HI>Romanes</HI> and drove them out of <HI>Bavaria;</HI> afterward it was divided into three Dukedomes by his three &s;onnes: <HI>Theedon</HI> the third who was &s;eated at <HI>Ratisbon, Otto</HI> et <HI>Otingis,</HI> and <HI>Theobald</HI> at <HI>Tyrolis.</HI> It would be too long to reckon up the other Princes. But at length the Emperour <HI>Ludovicke</HI> Duke of <HI>Bavaria,</HI> in the yeare of Chri&s;t 1439, did divide it in this manner, that the whole <HI>Norican Bavaria</HI> &s;hould belong to the Prince <HI>Palatines,</HI> except &s;ome Emperiall Citties, and what&s;oever formerly appertained to the Empire. The Metropolis of <HI>Bavaria</HI> is commonly called <HI>Nurenberg,</HI> which is plea&s;antly &s;eated by the River <HI>Pegnitius,</HI> which watereth the Cittie, it is very large and beautifull, and hath many faire Churches, curious buildings, great &s;treetes, being fortified with &s;trong walls, Towers, and Bulwarkes; and full of Cittizens, rich in Merchandi&s;e and famous through the whole world for <HI>Mechanick</HI> Arts: it is &s;ituated not only on the Navel as it were or middle of <HI>Germanie,</HI> but al&s;o of <HI>Europe;</HI> it is 500 miles di<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tant from <HI>Ieru&s;alem.</HI> Though the Cittie be of no great antiquitie, yet the Ca|&s;tle which is &s;ituate on a high hill, which was heretofore called <HI>Ca|strum Nuricum,</HI> is very auncient being built by the Emperour <HI>Claudius Tiberius,</HI> whence it was called <HI>Neroes</HI> Ca&s;tell. Heretofore it was &s;ub|ject to <HI>Albert</HI> Duke of <HI>Franconia,</HI> after who&s;e decea&s;e it came to the Empire in the reigne of the Emperour <HI>Ludovicke</HI> the third, and after|ward it increa&s;ed and began to grow very populous. In the time of <HI>Charles</HI> the fourth it was walled about: and againe in the yeare 1538. Now it is the faire&s;t and large&s;t Cittie in all <HI>Germanie,</HI> &s;o that it hath 128 &s;treetes&punc; 11 &s;tone Bridges, which doe conjoyne and unite the two parts of the Cittie. The River <HI>Flavius</HI> pa&s;&s;ing through the C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ttie doth drive 68 water-mills.

This Country is watered and enriched by the&s;e Rivers, namely <HI>Egar, Nubus, Vil&s;us, Regus, Pennitius, Schwartzach, Sultza, Altimulus,</HI> and <HI>Lautra,</HI> and &s;ome others. Hi&s;torians doe relate concerning the River <HI>Regni|tius,</HI> or <HI>Regus,</HI> that <HI>Charles</HI> the Great being at <HI>Ratisbon,</HI> was per&s;waded; that a navigable pa&s;&s;age might be made out of <HI>Rhene</HI> in|to <HI>Danubius,</HI> if a ditch were made betweene the Rivers <HI>Regnitius</HI> and <HI>Altimulus,</HI> which might be capable to receive and carry boates and ve&s;&s;ells: becau&s;e the one of tho&s;e Rivers doe runne into <HI>Danubius</HI> and the other into <HI>Rhene.</HI> The King &s;traightway chu&s;eth out a conve|nient place for this work, and having got great &s;tore of Labourers, he &s;pent all the <HI>Autumne</HI> quarter about it. So that a ditch was made
<PB N="556" REF="466">
betweene the afore&s;oyd Rivers, which was two miles long, and three hundered foote broade. But this worke came to nothing, for by rea&s;on of the raine, and that the &s;oyle was a Moori&s;h kind of earth, the worke could not &s;tand, for the earth fell downe in the night, and filled up as much as they had digged in the day time. Neere the Towne <HI>Wei&s;eberg,</HI> there are &s;ome tokens yet remaining of this vaine attempt. It is to bee noted that all the Rivers of <HI>Nortgow</HI> have Iron mills and other mettall mills, &s;o that they doe blow the bellowes, and drive the two hammers with their &s;treames, &s;o that the Smith neede but put the Iron under the Hammers on the Anvill, and the water will make the Hammers forge it. There is in this Countrie the Mount <HI>Pinifer,</HI> commonly called <HI>Fitchtelbergk,</HI> being &s;ixe miles about: out of which there doe flow foure famous Rivers, <HI>Moenus, Nabus, Sala,</HI> and <HI>Egra,</HI> which winding in the figure of a cro&s;&s;e; doe runne toward the foure &s;everall corners of the world. This Mountaine doth produce divers kind of mettalls, and the be&s;t blew colour, which is called <HI>Lazurus.</HI> There is Lead al&s;o found on the top of the Mountaine, and many pits, out of which mettalls were formerly digged. This Country al&s;o is, very where cloathed with &s;ome pieces of the wood <HI>Hercinia,</HI> as <HI>Wei&s;enburwalt, Behe|merwalt,</HI> and others, which are repre&s;ented in this Table. Moreo|ver when <HI>Bavaria</HI> had received the Chri&s;tian faith, there were lawes made, enacted for the government of the Land, namely con|cerning the libertie of the Church, concerning Church-burners, and Incendiaries, concerning tho&s;e that tooke Sanctuarie, concerning &s;trikers of the Clergie, concerning Tithes, &s;editious per&s;ons; al&s;o Martiall Lawes, Lawes for the tenure of Lands, for Brokage; for titles of inhaeritances, for buying and &s;elling, &amp;c. The&s;e lawes the <HI>Bavarians</HI> obeyed for many yeares, and &s;ome of them they doe &s;till obey. And here I cannot chu&s;e but adde &s;ome of the <HI>Bavarian</HI> Lawes. It was enacted that the Iudge, to the end hee might judge rightly, &s;hould have the Booke of the Statutes, and that thereby he &s;hould determine and end all &s;utes and controver&s;ies. Neither &s;hould the Iudges re&s;pect per&s;ons or gifts, but when he had Iudged right|ly he &s;hould have the ninth part of the compo&s;ition money. But if wrongfully, he &s;hould pay twice as much, as he had tooke away by his unju&s;t judgement: and moreover &s;hould be fined fortie &s;hillings. He that &s;old any thing for a certaine price, &s;hould &s;et downe the bar|gaine in writing, and have witne&s;&s;es thereunto. No bargaine or &s;ale unle&s;&s;e it were free and voluntarie, &s;hould be firme and currant. I omit the re&s;t, lea&s;t I &s;hould &s;eeme to over burden this de&s;cription, with the repetition of tho&s;e lawes, which <HI>Iohn Boeme Aubanus</HI> doth de&s;cribe at large.</P>

<HEAD>THE DVKEDOME OF POMERANIA.</HEAD>
<P>_POMERANIA is now a Dukedome, it lyeth by the <HI>Balthick</HI> Sea, and reacheth from the confines of <HI>Hol&s;atia</HI> even to <HI>Livonia.</HI> This Country was called by the fir&s;t Inhabitants in the Vandals Language, <HI>Pamorzi,</HI> and it had alwayes a peculiar people, who were never conque|red and as <HI>Bertius</HI> witne&s;&s;eth, unto whom wee are beholden for this di&s;cription, they were beaten or expul&s;ed out of their owne Coun|try. The Country is plaine, and hath few Hills, but euery where fruitfull, and watered with Riuers and Springs, having plea&s;ant Meddowes and greene Pa&s;tures, &s;hadie Woods, in which there are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ers kinde of wilde Bea&s;ts.

There are many faire Citties in <HI>Pomerania.</HI> The chiefe Citty is <HI>Stettinum</HI> which is &s;ituate by the River <HI>Viadrus,</HI> which is now called <HI>Odera:</HI> it was heretofore a long Fi&s;her Towne by the bancke of the River, but now it is the chiefe <HI>Metrapolis,</HI> and Mo|ther Citty of <HI>Pomerania.

Afterward the Kings for their tyranny and lu&s;t were expelled, which many times had cau&s;ed many changes, and mutations in the Empire. The names of the Kings are the&s;e: <HI>Romulus,</HI> who raigned 38. yeeres, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">, who raigned 43. yeeres, <HI>Tullus Ho&s;tilius,</HI> who raigned 32. yeeres, <HI>La<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> Martius,</HI> who raigned 24. yeeres, <HI>Tarquinius Pri&s;cus,</HI> who raigned 37. yeeres, <HI>Servius Tullius,</HI> who raigned 44. yeeres, <HI>Tarquinius Superbus,</HI> who raigned 25. yeeres.

of the Alpes over which they traveled. And the&s;e are the Sea Alpes, which ar al&s;o calld the <HI>Ligu&s;tina</HI> Alpes: The Cottian, Graecian, Penine, the Sammian Alpes, the Lepontian, the Rhetian, Iulian and Carnici|an. And &s;o much concerning the Alpes, which breadthwayes doe &s;e|perat and parte <HI>Italie</HI> from <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Germanie,</HI> the Apinine follow|eth, which running with a continuing ridge betweene the higher and the lower Sea, it divideth it length wayes into two parts or &s;ides. It is thought to have beene &s;o called, becau&s;e the foote of this Hill is by <HI>Hannibals</HI> Penine pa&s;&s;age.

But I pa&s;&s;e over them, lea&s;t I &s;hould be tedious. Moreover the Mountaines &amp; afore&s;aid, the Valleys and fields are crowned with woods, groves, and thicketts, many of which are named and celebrated by the ancients.

And that we may begin with the &s;acred workes, they are almo&s;t infinite, for <HI>Rome</HI> alone hath at this day above 300. Churches, of which &s;even are chiefly re&s;orted unto for Religion &s;ake; the fir&s;t is Saint <HI>Peters</HI> Church in the Vatican: which exceedeth all the Churches in the World for co&s;tly Marble worke, and magnificent building. There are many &s;ingular things in it: as &s;ome Pillars which were brought out of <HI>Salomons</HI> Temple: two Bra&s;&s;e Peacocks which were brought from <HI>P. Cornelius Scipio Africanus</HI> his Pyrami&s;&s;e, which was heretofore in the Vatican Valley. There are al&s;o the Tombes and Sepulchers of many Popes, and a Marble Tombe of the Emperour <HI>Otho</HI> the &s;econd: and in the Popes Chappell there is Doome&s;day, or the day of Judge|ment lively drawne by <HI>Michael Angelo.</HI> And that I may not omit the Mona&s;teries, the Ho&s;pitals for Strangers, the Ho&s;pitals for the Sicke, and for Orphanes. What &s;hould I &s;peake of the Popes and Cardinals Palaces? The Popes Palace is in the highe&s;t part of the Valitan, being fairely &s;eated: who leaving his Lateran Palace, did re|moove thither in regard of the plea&s;antne&s;&s;e and whole&s;omene&s;&s;e of the Seate. It was begun by Pope <HI>Nicholas</HI> the third, and enlarged by others, but perfected by <HI>Iulian</HI> the &s;econd, and <HI>Leo</HI> the tenth, and at la&s;t it was adorned with Buildings and Pictures by <HI>Xi&s;tus</HI> the fifth, &s;o that now the proud Pile &s;eemeth to touch the Heavens. The Staires are broad and ea&s;ie to a&s;cend, &s;o that one may ride on Hor&s;eback to the top of the Hou&s;e. For it is &s;o great that it &s;eemeth rather a Town than a Hou&s;e, there is <HI>Xi&s;tus</HI> Chapell which is as big as a great Church, whether when the See is vacant, the Cardinals doe meete together to create a Pope, which is commonly called the Conclave. It would be tedious to mention the other Palaces, and therefore we will pa&s;&s;e to other matters. The government of <HI>Italie</HI> followeth, which is two|fold; Politicall and Eccle&s;ia&s;ticall. Concerning the Politick and Civill government, this noble Country is devided into many Signio|ries. Among which, be&s;ide the Pope, the King of <HI>Naples,</HI> and the free Commonwealths, as <HI>Venice, Genoa, Lucen&s;is,</HI> and others, the chiefe in the Northerne part are, the Princes of <HI>Etruria, Ferrara, Mantua, Me|diolanum, Montis-Feraten&s;is,</HI> of <HI>Parma,</HI> of <HI>Salluzzia,</HI> and <HI>Verona.</HI> In the Southerne part there are many Nobles, which when occa&s;ion &s;hall be offerd, I will reckon up in their proper places.

The other Prie&s;ts are here much honou|red, and have great authority. And are more honoured than Noble|men. The Cardinals as <HI>Peter Mo&s;sias</HI> noteth, did &s;ucceed in place of the Con&s;uls, who heretofore governed the Romane Empire: the Archbi&s;hops are equall to Dukes: the Bi&s;hops to Earles, their Vicars or Sub&s;titutes are as it were Pre&s;idents of the Empire, &amp; the Provo&s;ts are as it were Praefects: the Arch-prie&s;ts are in the place of Tribunes of Souldiers, and the Chancellors doe repre&s;ent the Tribunes of the People. Moreover, <HI>Italie</HI> hath a threefold Law, the Pontificall, the Cae&s;arian, and the Municipall, the fir&s;t and &s;econd are to be knowne <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">her wheres; the third con&s;i&s;ts of Statutes and Lawes, which the Citties them&s;elves doe enact and make: but let &s;o much &s;uffice.

It is written the Mediolanians are excellent in Coun&s;el: the Venetians wi&s;e: the Lu|canians ra&s;h: the Pi&s;anians incon&s;tant: the Placentians provident: the Florentines &s;low: the Veronians faithfull: the Ferrarians wary: the Genoans ignorant: the Lucen&s;ians profitable: the Vol&s;cians en|vious: the Brutians blocki&s;h: the Mutinen&s;ians acute and ingenious: the Peru&s;inians quick and ready: the Senenians &s;low: and the Patavi|ans irre&s;olute.

And hence proceedeth that great plenty of Doctors, and famous men learned in divers Arts and Di&s;ciplines. It would be trouble&s;ome un|to me to reckon up a Catalogue of them, and tedious to the Reader. Moreover, the Italians doe exceed other people for courteous con|ver&s;ation, for gentlene&s;&s;e, and for witty conference, and di&s;cour&s;e. They are very ingenious and witty, quick of invention, and very do|cible, in matters of &s;tudy, and al&s;o in learning divers Arts. They have in all ages thir&s;ted after honour and glory, and have beene more de|&s;irous of prai&s;e than any others. They are &s;oft and effeminate, and gi|ven to Venery, quenching plea&s;ure with Milke, as fire is with Oyle. They are very de&s;irous of revenge: and they thinke it &s;weeter than life, and doe &s;ometime leave it by Will to their Po&s;terity. Moreo|over the afore&s;aid Manu&s;cript doth paint forth the women of divers Citties in this manner: the Senen&s;ians are faire: the Florentines de|licate: the Peru&s;enians neat: the Cajetanians faire: the Con&s;entine|ans ob&s;tinate: the Beneventanians clowni&s;h: th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Bononians arro|gant and proud: the Mutinen&s;ians bountifull: the Ce&s;enatians cove|tou&s;ly

&s;craping: the Genoans wanton: the Cremonians deceitfull&punc; the Placentians hard: the Lucen&s;ians cha&s;te: the Pi&s;torien&s;ians lo|ving and tractable. The Romans grave: the Capuanians proud: the Neapolitans carefull: the Brundi&s;inians &s;lothfull: the Ferrarians greedy: the Ravennatians courteous: the Urbinatians affable: the Vincentinians con&s;tant: the Parmen&s;ians covetous: the Papien&s;ians de&s;irous of gaine: the Mediolanen&s;ians witty conceited: the Pede|montanians prating and talkative: the Venetians wanton: the Ver|ronians comely: the Brixians diligent: the Formianians faire and beautifull: the Lauden&s;ians &s;uper&s;titious: the Cremonen&s;ians co&s;tly: the Tarvi&s;ians jealous: the Bergomatians crafty: the Aretinians &s;a|ving: and the Puteolanians faire. The Italians were heretofore &s;ot|ti&s;hly adicted to many &s;uper&s;titions. But now they doe all religiou&s;ly ob&s;erve the Ceremonies and Rites of the Romane Church: but that &s;ome few in the Southerne part of <HI>Italy</HI> do follow the Graecian Rites, who are al&s;o de&s;cended of the Graecians. But what a warlike people the Italians have beene, the conque&s;t of the world doth declare. And the afore&s;aid Manu&s;cript doth &s;hew which Citties doe exceed others in matter of Warre. In warlike affaires the Peru&s;inians are &s;tout: the Calabrians ra&s;h: the Spoletanians crafty: the Senen&s;ians for|tunate: the Bononians fierce: the Neapolitans couragious: the Tu|rentines are mitigators of their enemy: the Praten&s;ians &s;acrilegious: the Collen&s;ians lu&s;tfull: the Picenians ravenous: the Aemilians in|con&s;iderate: the Placentinians cruell: the Romanes valiant: the Mediolanians undaunted: the Vincentinians de&s;irous of revenge: the Pi&s;torians bloody: the Papien&s;ians firme and con&s;tant. Their Diet is &s;ober and frugall, and they are not curious in furni&s;hing their Tables, but when nece&s;&s;ity requires. They doe not all weare one kinde of habit, but they vary according to the time or the quality of the Per&s;on, and al&s;o in the forme and &s;hape of it. The Matrons here|tofore did goe with naked armes, bre&s;ts, and &s;houlders, and now they cover all with thin Vailes according to the Spani&s;h fa&s;hion. The Ve|netians goe civilly and neatly, the Florentians, the Tu&s;cians, the Me|diolanians, the Aemilians, and Ligurians, doe goe &s;omewhat braver. But the Romane Courtier doth excell all the re&s;t for long various colour'd Garments, but the Romane Citizen goeth more frugally, yet han&s;omely, but e&s;pecially the women who of late did affect the Tu&s;cane dre&s;&s;ing. <HI>Naples</HI> hath a habit that is more &s;hining and &s;plen|dide than co&s;tly. The Mediolanians in their apparell are gorgious, the Genoas neat, the Mantuans childi&s;h, the Neapolitans co&s;tly, the Venetians magnificent, the Florentines ridiculous. In revenging of injuries the Lucen&s;ians are gentle, the Mediolanians are &s;oone re|concil'd, the Peru&s;inians are di&s;&s;emblers, the Fulginatians are hot, the Mutinen&s;ians are placable, the Senen&s;ians couragious.

And although it be not fortified with walls, Bul|warks, or Towers, yet it is &s;trong by the naturall &s;ituation. It is de|vided with many Channels. There are Rivers in all the &s;treets, which are joyned together by 450. &s;tone and woodden Bridges. The chief|e&s;t Channell is that which is called <HI>Canal grande,</HI> three miles long, which devideth the whole Citty into two parts.

It doth abound with Corne which is brought thither out of divers parts of the World, as al&s;o with divers &s;orts of Wine, among which is that generous &s;ort of Wine, which is commonly called Malme&s;y, and with other things, nece&s;&s;ary to mans life, &s;o that it may be rightly call'd the Paradi&s;e of Delight. There are in it 64. Pari&s;hes. There are al&s;o magnificent and &s;umptuous publike and private buil|dings. The chiefe&s;t Church is that which is dedicated to Saint <HI>Marke</HI> the Evangeli&s;t, which is gilded in many places. And to omit other matters, there is an Armory within the Citty, commonly call'd the <HI>Ar&s;enale,</HI> which is about two miles in compa&s;&s;e. Here are made of Wood, Iron, Bra&s;&s;e, Hempe, and Flaxe, all kindes of provi&s;ion for Ships, as Anchors, Guns, Cables, Ropes, Tackles, and Sailes. Here are al&s;o &s;ome En&s;ignes kept which were taken from the Turke, or Pirates, or Enemies, and tho&s;e Trophies which were taken at <HI>Nau|pactum</HI> in the yeere 1581.

The Country of <HI>Carniola</HI> although it bee Mountainous, as the other Coun|tries of this Province; yet it hath plenty of Wine, Oyle, Fruite, aad Corne. But they make <HI>Carniola</HI> twofold: the drye which wanteth wa|ter: and the moi&s;t, in which the River <HI>Nauus</HI> ri&s;eth, and al&s;o <HI>Nauportus</HI> which is now called <HI>Labatus,</HI> and many other Rivers. It is adorned with the title of a Dukedome. The chiefe Citty is <HI>Labacum,</HI> which hath the &s;ame name with the River. Some doe place <HI>Goritia</HI> in <HI>Carnio|la,</HI> which we mentioned before in <HI>Forum Iulium.</HI> On the left hand banck of <HI>Sontius</HI> upwards, there are two Fortre&s;&s;es, which the Venetians built heretofore to defend the River, and to prevent the incur&s;ions and inroads of the Turkes. Moreover there is a Lake in this Country, which affordeth every yeare a harve&s;t, fi&s;hing, and hunting. The Inha|bitants doe call it <HI>Zircknitzerzee</HI> from the Towne <HI>Zircknitz,</HI> which is &s;ituated by it. But I will make a more accurrate de&s;cription of it out of <HI>George Wernherus:</HI> it is enclo&s;ed every where with Mountaines, for halfe a Mile together it is not very broade. Out of the Mountaines there doe i&s;&s;ue certaine &s;mall Rivers, which are every one contayned in their owne Channells: on the Ea&s;t &s;ide there are three, on the South five. The farther that they runne the more narrower they grow, for their bankes are &s;traite, untill they are &s;wallowed up in the hoany pa&s;&s;ages of the Cliffes, which &s;eeme as if they were cut out by humane Indu&s;try. So that where they find an open place the waters doe &s;pread abroade, and make a Lake. The&s;e waters doe as &s;peedily runne back as they flowe forward, not onely in tho&s;e narrow channells, but al&s;o through the earth, which when the Inhabitants perceive, they &s;topp the greater pa&s;&s;ages, and Concavities, and &s;o goe to fi&s;hing, which is both plea&s;ant and profitable. For the fi&s;h which they take here be|ing &s;alted is tran&s;ported to other Countries. Moreover when the Lake is drie they have a kind of harve&s;t, for they &s;owe it and mowe it before that it be overflow'd againe. It beareth &s;uch abundance of gra&s;&s;e, that in twenty dayes it will be ready to cut. Who therefore cannot chu&s;e but admire at the&s;e wonders of nature? But &s;o much cocerning the&s;e things, I pa&s;&s;e to the re&s;t.</P>
