<SPEAKER>Crucy.</SPEAKER>
<P>_WEll met, well met Ma&s;ter <HI>Wre&s;t-Writ,</HI> you are &s;uch an eager man; Do you remember, Sir, the conference we had, when we la&s;t encountred, almo&s;t in this very place? Doe you &s;till pur&s;ue your errours with that wilfull heat?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Factious.</SPEAKER>
<P>Out of my &s;ight thou Idolater; pro|phane&s;&s;e hangs in a mi&s;t about thee, that thou mai&s;t commit thy deeds of darkne&s;&s;e with the Whore of Babilon with more &s;ecurene&s;&s;e.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Crucy.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not &s;o ha&s;ty Ma&s;ter <HI>Wre&s;t-Wright,</HI> a good cau&s;e &s;hould be di&s;puted with good words, and con|firmed with rea&s;ons, not with pa&s;&s;ions.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Factious.</SPEAKER>
<P>Down <HI>Dagon,</HI> down, I hate thee <HI>Cringe;</HI>
<PB N="2" REF="3">I hate thee and thy late di&s;puted doctrine of the reall pre&s;ence in the Sacrament, wor&s;e than the lawne Reeves of the Prelates, which are but meer rags of <HI>Rome,</HI> and fit onely for tinder for the Tinder-box of <HI>Tophet;</HI> but goe to M<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;ter <HI>Cringe,</HI> becau&s;e &s;ociety is the injunction of nature; and good di&s;cour&s;e (they &s;ay) doth make a hor<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">e that trots &s;eeme to amble, proceed in your la&s;t argument, and I promi&s;e you both &s;ilence and attention.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Crucy.</SPEAKER>
<P>If you will be patient I will: The doctrine then of the reall pre&s;ence in the Euchari&s;t.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Factious.</SPEAKER>
<P>The Euchari&s;t! I can forbeare the argu|ment no longer; there is no &s;uch word to be read in all the Scripture.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Crucy.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very frequently, Sir, in the Greek originall.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Factious.</SPEAKER>
<P>Talk not to me of Greek, I will beleeve no Greek, it is a language that &s;hall carry no autho|rity with me; I hope to &s;ee Greek and Latine too, ere it be long, in le&s;&s;e reputation than they are.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Crucy.</SPEAKER>
<P>I doe not like this fury, E'en God be with you, and grant your zeale more knowledge, and your knowledge more humility.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Factious.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay but hark you Ma&s;ter <HI>Cringe,</HI> hark you one word,&mdash;look you here,&mdash;Ma&s;ter <HI>Accepted Weighall:</HI>&mdash;Come as wi&s;ht for.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Accepted.</SPEAKER>
<P>How have you done this long time? How doe you Ma&s;ter <HI>Crucy?</HI> Sir, I heartily &s;alute you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Crucy.</SPEAKER>
<P>I returne your &s;alutation with the like te&s;ti|mony of good will, and true affect on: you intervene an happy Vmpire, we two were e'en a falling out, and a falling off too.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Factious.</SPEAKER>
<P>Verily, Ma&s;ter <HI>Weighall,</HI> the words of truth being not in his lips, I was about to &s;eparate, and to leave him to the fogs of his &s;uper&s;titious ignorance,
<PB N="3" REF="3">I mu&s;t be&s;eech you, having &s;o happily met with your bet|ter company, that we may abandon him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Accept.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why &s;o Sir, Although I am a Profe&s;&s;our of true and Orthodox Religion, I am not of the &s;eparation; I would be neither a <HI>Trojan,</HI> nor <HI>Tyrian;</HI> it fares with Religi|on as with Vertue, &s;he mu&s;t pre&s;erve her &s;elfe entire be|twixt two extreames; and the &s;afe&s;t way to truth is the middle way; I would be neither learnedly &s;uper&s;tirious, nor ob&s;tinately ignorant; but to the point which you were &s;o hot in di&s;putation of.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Factious.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, when la&s;t Ma&s;ter <HI>Cringe</HI> and I encountred, we held a controver&s;ie concerning the reall pre&s;ence in the Sacrament, which Ma&s;ter <HI>Cringe</HI> beleeveth to be truly corporall, and in adoration bowes unto it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Crucy.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, I beleeve the Sacrament to be a greater my|&s;tery then peradventure you conceive it, and not a meere Love-fea&s;t, as idly enough you are plea&s;ed to fancy it; I dare affirme, that the great worke of mans Redemption is no where more perfectly to be di&s;covered, <HI>Nec tam prae|&s;entes alibi cogno&s;cere Divos.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Factious.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, you are in your Latine, I will have La|tine againe to an&s;wer you; I a&s;&s;ure you I take it to be a Commemoration <HI>per fidem,</HI> onely in remembrance of our Saviours &s;ufferings, on whom we feed with the eye of faith.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Crucy.</SPEAKER>
<P>That cannot be Ma&s;ter <HI>Wre&s;t-Writ,</HI> the words are po&s;itive and punctuall, <HI>This is my Body,</HI> and will admit of no other interpretation.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Factious.</SPEAKER>
<P>The words that follow that text doe as plainly and punctually interpret the words precedent, <HI>Doe this in remembrance of me,</HI> which implies a direct ab&s;ence of the party; for what needs a remembrance, when the per&s;on is pre&s;ent? and in this I referre my &s;elfe to Ma&s;ter <HI>Weigh|all.</HI> You affirmed be&s;ides at our la&s;t meeting, that you did
<PB N="4" REF="4">feed in the Sacrament, upon the very body of Chri&s;t indeed.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Crucy.</SPEAKER>
<P>I feed in the Sacrament on the very Body and Bloud of Chri&s;t, the elements of Bread and Wine, being tran&s;ub&s;tantiated into his Body.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Factious.</SPEAKER>
<P>This is mo&s;t horrible impiety. How is this tran&s;ub&s;tantiation? when is it begun? when is it fini&s;hed? an&s;wer me to that, Ma&s;ter <HI>Cringe.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Crucy.</SPEAKER>
<P>Immediately after the words of the con&s;e|cration.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Factious.</SPEAKER>
<P>That cannot be, for the Metaphy&s;icks (as I have heard Schollers &s;ay) will not allow that the &s;ub|&s;tance &s;hould be altered, and the accidents remaine, that the Bread and Wine &s;hould be converted into the very Body and Bloud of Chri&s;t; yet the colour and ta&s;te of the Bread and Wine, which are their accidents, &s;hould &s;till continue; neither will Divinity ever agree, that the Bread, which after con&s;ecration, you &s;ay, is turned into the Bo|dy of Chri&s;t, &s;hould &s;uffer afterwards, corruption, and moulder away, as we &s;ee it doth.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Crucy.</SPEAKER>
<P>We feed, I &s;ay, in the Sacrament on the very Body of Chri&s;t; but how? not as we feed on butchers meat bought in the &s;hambles; but it being received with all reverence, and prepared humility after a divine and &s;pi|rituall manner; and what&s;oever you are plea&s;ed to &s;ay to to the contrary of us, beleeve me, there is no Catholick but is of the &s;ame opinion with me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Factious.</SPEAKER>
<P>That you doe to avoid &s;ome dangerous ab&s;ur|dities which would con&s;equently ari&s;e, &s;hould you affirme, that in a fle&s;hly manner you eat in the Sacrament, the very fle&s;h of our Saviour; for then by the &s;ame argument &s;hould the ble&s;&s;ed Virgin, the mother of our Saviour, feed in the Sacrament, on the fle&s;h of her owne &s;on; and then again, as often as in the time of Leat you receive the Communi|on,
<PB N="5" REF="4">you &s;hould as often offend again&s;t the order of the Church, which doth command, that there &s;hould in Lent no meat be eaten. Be&s;ides, I under&s;tand how cro&s;&s;e it is to rea&s;on and Philo&s;ophy, that one Body &s;hould at one and the &s;ame time move in &s;everall places.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Crucy.</SPEAKER>
<P>Wonders are no wonders in wonderfull &s;ub|jects; I beleeve as the Church beleeveth, which doth in|forme me, that the Body of our Saviour is a&s;&s;i&s;ted alwayes with the Divinity of our Saviour, and in this (as Ma&s;ter <HI>Wre&s;t-Writ</HI> did before) I referre my &s;elfe to you Ma&s;ter <HI>Weighall.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Factious.</SPEAKER>
<P>With all my heart, and if we &s;hall continue in our journey and travell one way together; as in this, &s;o in all controverted points betwixt us, I &s;hall referre my &s;elfe to your advice, Ma&s;ter <HI>Weighall.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Weighall.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have not the de&s;ire, nor yet the ability to goe thorow with &s;o great a taske; but &s;ince it is the incli|nation of truth to communicate her&s;elfe, and through all my life I have made it my labour to enquire her out: I will, as neare as I can, fir&s;t &s;tate the que&s;tion aright, and then determine it. I beleeve we ought not to make our ap|proaches to the ble&s;&s;ed Sacrament, with that overween|ing familiarity, as the &s;awcy Browni&s;ts; nor yet with &s;uch a devout &s;uper&s;tition as the abu&s;ed Papi&s;ts. That the Bread and wine in the Sacrament &s;hould be tran&s;ub&s;tantiated into the Body of Chri&s;t, cannot be admitted into the faith of any &s;ober man, without admitting with it many gro&s;&s;e and grievous errours; for be&s;ides that, it is but a meere invention of latter times, it is diametrically oppo&s;ite to rea&s;on and nature; and God him&s;elfe, who oftentimes doth work above nature, doth never work again&s;t it. The elevation of the Ho&s;t by the Papi&s;ts, &s;avours of rank ido|latry; and the unmannerly &s;itting of the Browni&s;ts at the Communion, of irreverence. A decent and humble po|&s;ture
<PB N="6" REF="5">is mo&s;t requi&s;ite, e&s;pecially where God is plea&s;ed to communicate him&s;elfe to be really, and more peculiar|ly pre&s;ent. It is no lukewarmene&s;&s;e, no neutrality to keepe &s;afe between both your errours, but a grounded know|ledge and uprightne&s;&s;e: And I a&s;&s;ure my &s;elfe, if you would well weigh, with how much &s;afety between both rockes the Truth doth pa&s;&s;e by un&s;hip-wrackt, how &s;ecure and cleare &s;hee is di&s;covered, you would then make ha&s;t to di&s;embogue, and make up unto her, who indeed is the Center of all &s;ublunary happine&s;&s;e, where alone we may finde peace with confidence. Errours in the Church re&s;ult out of too unruly an heat, or too thick and too grave a Su|per&s;tition; either while we violently are lead by our own ungoverned humours, or while blinded with pompe, or with the &s;hadowes of Antiquitie with a willing reverence wee are drawne unto Idolatry. Too much Ceremony and an affected pompe hath begot much Super&s;tition in the Sacrament among&s;t the Papi&s;ts. Too carele&s;&s;e a pre|&s;umption hath begot much irreverence in the Sacrament among&s;t the Anabapti&s;ts. The mean betwixt both is the fate and happy way attended with a per&s;evering care, not to decline, either to the one, or to the other, either to the right hand, or to the left.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Crucy.</SPEAKER>
<P>I thanke you for your good coun&s;els, and &s;hall endeavour to embrace them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Factious.</SPEAKER>
<P>And I &s;hall acknowledge my &s;elfe to be much improved by you which doth embolden me to propound one que&s;tion more, and that is concerning the Originall, and the In&s;titution of Bi&s;hops.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Accept.</SPEAKER>
<P>I &s;hould with much content lend care to your Conference, but &s;ee the Towne is neare, and within the full view of our eye; we will therefore for this day repo&s;e our minds as well as bodyes; and refer the di&s;cour&s;e untill the Morning.</P>
