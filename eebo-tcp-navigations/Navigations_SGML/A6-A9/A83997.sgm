<HEAD>NECESSARY OBSERVATIONS CONCERNING DOVER, AND OTHER SEA-TOWNS OF <HI>ENGLAND.</HI></HEAD>
<P>_DOVER with her Ca&s;tle hath (by Ancients) been accounted, The lock and key to the whole Realme of <HI>England.</HI> Likewi&s;e the five Ports, together with the two ancient Townes annexed, or incorporated into the &s;ame; with their &s;eaven members, have all of them been places of great &s;trength and importance; and con|&s;equently, have therefore obtained many great priviledges. In this Latine Ver&s;e next en&s;uing (unfitting to be in this ob&s;er|vation omitted) are all the &s;aid fourteen Haven Townes &s;et forth.</P>
<Q LANG="lat"><L>Ha&s;tingus, Dover, Sandwicus, Romneus, Hithus,</L>

<P>Engli&s;hed, <Q><HI>Ha&s;ting, Dover, Sandwich, Romney,</HI> and <HI>Hith,</HI> are the Cinque or five Ports, <HI>Rye</HI> and <HI>Winchel&s;ea</HI> are the two ancient Townes, united and incorporated into the &s;ame priviledges the &s;aid Cinque-Ports enjoy.</Q></P>

<P> <HI>Fever&s;ham, Foulk&s;ton, Sea-ford, Lydd, Fordwich, Tenterden,</HI> and <HI>Peven&s;ey,</HI> are the Five Ports, and two ancient Townes, &s;everall members, be&s;ides <HI>Deale.

<P>The Ca&s;tles of <HI>Dover, Sandowne, Deale, Walmer, Sandgate, Camber, Moates-Bulwarke,</HI> and <HI>Archcliff<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">-Bulwarke&punc;</HI> the&s;e many yeares now pa&s;t, have been much decayed in their &s;everal Ma|gazens of Armes, and all &s;orts of warlike Munition, which have heretofore been kept and continually very well &s;upported and maintained; as not onely honourable, &s;trong, and defen&s;ible Forts, &s;tanding next unto the Seas, being Frontiers of this Realme; but al&s;o &s;o nece&s;&s;ary Fortifications for the defence and &s;afeguard of the &s;ame, that they have alwayes been repaired, and with Munition continually &s;upplyed, for the publique de|fence of this Kingdome, yet of late yeares have wanted much provi&s;ion of abiliaments for Warre, or warlike defence; be&s;ides all the defects in &s;tore. A part of the North Wall of <HI>Dover</HI> Ca&s;tle &s;ince the yeare 1637. by tempe&s;tuous or &s;uch like wea|ther, hath fallen downe into the Ca&s;tle-trench. Likewi&s;e much of the Leads of the Kings lodgings in the &s;aid Ca&s;tle have by boy&s;terous tempe&s;ts and great winds, blown quite up to the top of the &s;tone-worke thereof, and &s;ome blowne over it; impairing the who<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">e Tymber Fabricke underneath, to the great prejudice of <HI>Englands</HI> &s;omtimes glorious &amp; formidable Common-wealth; notwith&s;tanding, the &s;everall provi&s;ions, &s;tores, and Magazens of the &s;aid Ca&s;tles, &amp;c. have been of late much decayed, have little or nothing been repleni&s;hed.</P>
<P>At the fir&s;t comming of the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> great Fleete of Warre in the beginning of <HI>September</HI> 1639. into the narrow Seas, and in|to the Kings Chamber, there &s;o called; The &s;aid &s;everall Ca|&s;tles. Bulwarks, and places of Defence, were all, or mo&s;t of them, without any &s;trength formidable before the face of &s;o &s;trong and mightie a Fleete, or any power re&s;i&s;table, if an attempt had been performed by the va&s;t and War-like <HI>Spani&s;h</HI>-Fleete afore|&s;aid; but contrariwi&s;e, in very weake plight and dolefull &s;tate, even in depaire of loo&s;ing the mo&s;t part of the Sea-Townes
<PB N="5" REF="3">and Fortifications neere <HI>Dover,</HI> the <HI>Downes,</HI> and el&s;ewhere, if not the dangerous de&s;truction of the whole I&s;land, nay, the whole Kingdome.</P>
<P>For further demon&s;tration of the Ca&s;tles and Sea-coa&s;ts &s;e|verall weakne&s;&s;es, three hundred land-&s;ouldiers were appointed out of the &s;aid five Ports, Haven-Towns, and Members to be rai&s;ed for pur&s;uite of the <HI>Scots</HI> in that late expedition, if they had been compelled unto, and to march away from the &s;aid Ports, had been a de&s;igne onely to weaken, the then weake and too weak, &s;ea-coa&s;ts for &s;uch a time of action: heretofore they have been accounted the keyes of <HI>England,</HI> yet at that time of emi|nent danger, they might well have been e&s;teemed, the De&s;tru|ction of <HI>England.</HI> Had we not been then by the <HI>Holland</HI> Navie defended (as one well termed it, the &s;courge of <HI>Spaine</HI>) whom together with us were protected by the divine providence a|bove, in guiding Admirall <HI>Van-Trompe</HI> here below, <HI>England</HI> doubtle&s;&s;e in the &s;aid yeer 1639 had mi&s;erably felt the &s;avage crueltie of <HI>Spaines</HI> great Treacherie; to a Kingdom then and &s;till in League and friend&s;hip with him. Heretofore the coura|gious &s;toutne&s;&s;e of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> had rather expire in a valiant re|&s;i&s;tance, than yeeld to the la&s;ting &s;lavery of &s;o proud a Nation.</P>
<P>Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> of ever famous memorie, kept them under enough; and their <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> proud hearts humble in &s;ight onely of her Maje&s;ties &s;hips, and her Vice-Admirall Sir <HI>Francis Drake;</HI> as for in&s;tance, when the Armado of <HI>Spaine</HI> in the yeer 1588. was arrived in the Narrow Seas, having pa&s;&s;ed the place of their ex|pected &s;upply, and gotten Sea-roome for their high bodied Hulks, &s;pread their main &s;ails, and made away as fa&s;t as winde and water would give them leave, more fearing the &s;mall Fleet and Forces of the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> (though nothing in number like unto them) than &s;tanding upon termes of Honour either of their chieftains or Invicible Navy: Yet &s;urely if they had known the want of Powder, (a fault unexcu&s;able upon our coa&s;ts) they (no doubt) would have &s;tood longer to their tacklings. But God in this of 1588. as likewi&s;e of the la&s;t Armado of <HI>Spaine,</HI> 1639. would have us to acknowledge, that we were onely delivered by his own gracious providence and arme, and not by any po|licie or &s;trength of our own. A Motto on the &s;aid Vice-Admi|rall
<PB N="6" REF="4"><HI>Drake,</HI> though not much pertinent to the matter in the pre|cedencie of the&s;e ob&s;ervations treated on, yet de&s;ervedly to be remembred to the everla&s;ting renown of &s;o valiant and &s;o true a Subject to the &s;aid Queen <HI>Elizabeth.</HI>
<Q><L>If Popery &s;hould (which God forbid) re-raigne,</L>
<L>They could not, Noble <HI>Drake,</HI> dig up thy grave,</L>
<L>As once they did, I &s;ay, with fell di&s;dain,</L>
<L>Again&s;t good <HI>Luther</HI> furiou&s;ly rage and rave.</L>
<L>They could not doe't 'gainst thee, I &s;ay, for why,</L>
<L>Thy bones in th'bottome of the &s;ea do lie.</L></Q></P>
<P>Now to the Subject afore&s;aid, notwith&s;tanding the weak|ne&s;&s;e of the &s;aid Fortifications, in that time of &s;treight 1639. <HI>Englands</HI> Sea provi&s;ion was as weak, if not weaker than the Ca|&s;tles, Fortifications, &amp;c. Provi&s;ion on the &s;hore, onely foure of his Maje&s;ties &s;hips (neer tho&s;e Sea rowns and Villages afore|named then and &s;till in di&s;tre&s;&s;e, if no better fortified then with|in the&s;e few moneths now pa&s;t, if any occa&s;ion or attempt in a warlike manner be offered) for a&s;&s;i&s;tance and pre&s;ervation of <HI>Brittaines</HI> great I&s;land; What were his Highne&s;&s;e &s;aid 4. &s;hips of warre to the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> great Gallownes fiftie three in number? full of provi&s;ion of all materials for warre, fitted with grave and (que&s;tionle&s;&s;e) skilfull Sea-men. Moreover in each &s;aid &s;hip or great Gallowne, were a very great &s;tore of Land-men: Like|wi&s;e to each &s;everall great companies were Captains both of &s;ea and land &s;ouldiers, in tho&s;e va&s;t Gallownes.</P>
<P>The report of a friend of mine, skilfull both in Sea and Land Imployments, declared his opinion, That this mighty Fleet was bound either for <HI>England</HI> or <HI>Ireland,</HI> and, &s;aid he, a fit time for them to act their afore-intended De&s;ignes; By rea&s;on <HI>England</HI> hath enough to do with <HI>Scotland</HI> at pre&s;ent: yet (&s;aid he) though their pretence be for the relief of <HI>Flanders</HI> chief City and Sea-town <HI>Dunkerke,</HI> there to di&s;charge their multitudes of Sea and Land Souldiers, &s;aid he, the Hulls or Bottoms of tho&s;e mighty warlike Gallownes draw too much water for ever coming to <HI>Dunkerke,</HI> or any nearer than a League or two: therefore (&s;aid he) if their Commi&s;&s;ions were made known, this Fleet is to land in &s;ome Port or Ports of <HI>England,</HI> for they have both Sea and
<PB N="7" REF="4">Land Companies, and likewi&s;e their Ordnance are mounted with Land carriages above the Decks of their Gallownes; To the intent immediatly after their landing in their Ports de&s;igned by their Commi&s;&s;ions, that with the Field or Land carriages wherewith the &s;aid Ordnance are mounted, may di&s;play upon the Countrey; And likewi&s;e with mans &s;trength, or otherwi&s;e, draw them again&s;t the Ca&s;tles, Bulwarks, and fortified Places of this I&s;land, thereby forthwith to obtain a great part of the Shire or Countie wherein they land, untill repul&s;e, nay even to the City of <HI>London,</HI> the Metropolitane City of this Kingdom of <HI>England.</HI> Many great Papi&s;ts (of this Kingdom (for in&s;tance) during the Spani&s;h Fleets &s;tay in the Downs, a good Road for &s;hips neer <HI>Dover</HI>) came thither, and were very jocant and jovi|all, nay &s;ome of them in a kind of commanding way, &s;eeing things almo&s;t compliant with their purpo&s;es.</P>
<P>And at the time afore&s;aid generally through the whole King|dom, every Province or County had a Trea&s;urer for the Pa|Pi&s;ts, to &s;upply the wants either of weapons or money of all the Popi&s;h party that needed therein; &s;o that con&s;equently the &s;aid <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Fleet came for and was provided for this Kingdom in that time of <HI>Englands</HI> di&s;tre&s;&s;e. I &s;ay di&s;tre&s;&s;e, by rea&s;on of the intended warre betwixt <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Scotland,</HI> which (God be prai&s;ed) hath ended in a ble&s;&s;ed peace, and likewi&s;e the weak|ne&s;&s;e of <HI>Englands</HI> Navie and Fortifications afore&s;aid. Now not omitting a true ver&s;e, de&s;cribing this Kingdoms publique wel|fare, (if truly ob&s;erved) for the knowledge of <HI>Englands</HI> Wor|thies in the Honorable and high Court of <HI>Parliament,</HI> now a&s;|&s;embled as followeth.
<Q><L>England's &s;afe gates, are her Cirqueports,</L>
<L>Her &s;tately &s;hips, her walls:</L>
<L>Her Camps, the Sea; Bulwarks, her Corps;</L>

<P>The dayes are now dangerous, and full of mi&s;chiefs infinite, therefore if the great Councell of Parliament would but ca&s;t their eyes (on the Kings Navie, Ca&s;tles, Towers, Bulwarks, Blockhou&s;es, and all fortified places for <HI>Englands</HI> &s;afetie and de|fence,

<P>That likewi&s;e per&s;ons of good tru&s;t, and well affected to the Prote&s;tant Religion, may continually be imployed in all the Kings &s;hips, Ca&s;tles, Towers, Bulwarks, Block-hou&s;es, and all other fortified places of this Kingdom; &s;o that <HI>England</HI> may hereafter be as formidable as ever to the terror of her Enemies, and the &s;afetie of her Inhabitants, and the advancement of the true Prote&s;tant Religion; the which que&s;tionle&s;&s;e will give great &s;atisfaction to all good Prote&s;tants, Gods children, and the Kings mo&s;t loyall and obedient &s;ubjects.</P>
<P>Now let us all conclude, that your Indeavours may (by Gods mo&s;t gracious a&s;&s;i&s;tance) be for our Countreys and Kingdom flouri&s;hing in true Religion, and repul&s;e to all our Enemies do|me&s;tick and forraigne, both of Church and State, holding this Maxime for ever:</P>
