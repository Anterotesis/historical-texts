<HEAD>The valiant <HI>RESOLVTION</HI> OF The <HI>Sea-men</HI> Li&s;ted under the command of the Earl of <HI>Warwicke,</HI> who upon Mun|day la&s;t mo&s;t valiantly beate and &s;lew a great number of Prince <HI>Rubert</HI> his Fortes who were comming to take <HI>Sion-hou&s;e.</HI></HEAD>
<P>_VPon Satterday la&s;t being the 12 of <HI>November</HI> Prince <HI>Rubert,</HI> who before, had lay &s;couting up and downe with his For|ces, taking advantage of the mi&s;ty Morn|ing, advaunced his Eorces, and came toward <HI>Branford,</HI> the &s;uddennes of who&s;e comming was &s;uch, that the Inhabitants of the &s;aid Town were in&s;en&s;ible of his comming
<PB REF="3">neither had they the lea&s;t inteligence of his Approch, by re&s;aon whereof he found but &s;mall oppo&s;ition, vntill the Lord Ro|berts who did not lye far off came with with his men. At the approch of the Lord Roberts with his men, Prince Rupert had allmo&s;t gotten the Bridg, but was &s;tayed by him, &s;o that without the lo&s;&s;e of any of his men he got in to the Towne.</P>
<P>And planted him&s;elfe and his men upon the Edge of the Hils, and a bout twelf or one of the clocke in the after none who began to play afre&s;h vpon the Lord Roberts and his Forces, but their orduance did little or no execution which cau&s;ed a great di&s;content in the Cavaleirs and made them &s;were that the Divill was in the powder there Bulets in their great cannon did not fly halfe way of there intended purpo&s;e &s;o that before, that before they could reach the mark they aimed that their power and vigor was &s;pent.</P>
<P>When Prince <HI>Rubert</HI> had played thus
<PB REF="3">&s;ome certain time but to &s;mall purpo&s;e our men who all this while had bin almo&s;t idle, the greate&s;t part of their amunition being behind, were now encoraged with new &s;uply of men and amunition, and al|though they before had &s;u&s;tained &s;om &s;mal lo&s;&s;e, yet they were not thereby di&s;maide, but made good afterwards for that they had &s;uffered before now Colonell Hampden and Collonell Hollis came in with theire forces and with them greate &s;tore of Am|munition, of which before there was great nede on the Parliaments &s;ide.</P>
<P>And now being &s;o well provided for the Enimy, they went brauely on, and with undanted &s;perit played with their great pieces vpon the Enemy, which peaces did brave execution and &s;ervice that in a &s;mall &s;pace there fell of the Cavaleirs avery geat number, but of the Parliaments &s;ide very few.</P>
<PB REF="4">
<P>The Cavaleirs perceiving their lo&s;&s;e to be &s;o great, and the lo&s;&s;e on the <HI>Parliaments</HI> &s;ide to be &s;o &s;mall, upon Sunday Night at bout eleaven or twelve of the clocke did quit that place, and Prince <HI>Rubert</HI> with all his forces fell backe to <HI>Kingflon;</HI> which Towne by the treachery of the inhabitants was delivered up unto the Cavaleirs, and the town&s;men have &s;ince pulled up the Bridge; &s;o that all pa&s;&s;age for pur&s;uite af|ter them is hindred.</P>
<P>And I cannot here pa&s;&s;e by the inhuman and mo&s;t barbarous actions of the Cava|leirs at their entrance into <HI>Acton,</HI> among&s;t the re&s;t one example being of a mo&s;t bar|barous nature, will render their conditi|ons odious unto you. When they entred the town fir&s;t of all, and were &s;eated therein, &s;ome of the Cavaleirs went up and downe to plunder where they had intelligence a|ny &s;tore of money, Plate, or jewels of va|lue were; among&s;t the re&s;t it happened that they came unto one Mr. <HI>Pierce</HI> his hou&s;e, but he not being then who is a <HI>Brewer</HI> in
<PB REF="4">the Towne of <HI>Acton,</HI> they comming to this Mr. <HI>Pierce</HI> his hou&s;e, did demaund the Mr. of the hou&s;e, but he not being then within would not be content with that an&s;wer but fell to pillaging; Mi&s;tris <HI>Peircy</HI> the <HI>Brewers</HI> wife, having not bin delivered of a child above one weeke before, was very much affrighted at the vnruly carriage of the Cavaliers, and although &s;he was weake yet thinking by faire per&s;wa&s;ions and pro|mi&s;es to appea&s;e them for the pre&s;ent came down and de&s;ired them that they would de&s;i&s;t from &s;uch uncivill actions and that they &s;hould have what they could de&s;ire, or the hou&s;e could &s;upply them withall.</P>
<P>The&s;e her faire &s;peeches gave them but little or noe &s;ati&s;faction but the more &s;he intreated the more violent were they in the per&s;ecution of their violent mi&s;deme|nours, &s;hee per&s;wads but they were &s;till as death as adders, and at the la&s;t one of them more cruell then the others, as &s;he was &s;tanding by weeping did cock his pi&s;toll, and &s;hot her with her child in
<PB REF="5">her little babe in her Armes, &s;uch an act of barbarous cruelty <HI>I</HI> thinke &s;carce any Chrouicle can parralell &s;uch unhumane acts.</P>
<P>Upon Munday, after the Cavaliers had lo&s;t <HI>Brainford,</HI> and &s;heltred them&s;elves in <HI>King&s;ton,</HI> after &s;ome time, &s;ome of them came over the water againe and tooke <HI>Sion-hou&s;e,</HI> thinking by this meanes to &s;top all provi&s;ion from comming unto the City, but they were much deceived, for the <HI>Sea|men</HI> who had li&s;ted them&s;elves under the Earle of <HI>Warwicke</HI> tooke two &s;mall Pini&s;&s;es mand with fourteene peeces of Ordnance, and with them gave many a brave &s;hot a|gain&s;t the hou&s;e, but could doe but little good by rea&s;on of the &s;trength of the buil|ding could do &s;mall execution.</P>
<P>Vpon which they were con&s;trained to draw away their &s;hips, for want of the tide to carry them backe and likwi&s;e con&s;trayned to &s;inke them lea&s;t the Ca|valiers &s;hould &s;eize one the Ordnance, and by this meanes they have defeated the expectation of the Cavaliers.</P>
