<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>TIS certain that Trade in Ge|neral is a Great Benefit to, and a Main Support of any Nation; and the Wollen Manufacture of this in particular: Therefore 'tis of Great Con|cernment, to endeavour by all means po&s;|&s;ible, to pre&s;erve and increa&s;e it. But to our Sorrow, we have our Ears fill'd with daily Complaints of the great Decay of it; and the mo&s;t effectual means to find out a Remedy, is to enquire into the Cau&s;e. I did in the Year, 1669. expre&s;s my Fears to King <HI>Charles II.</HI> of a great Decay of our Wollen Manufacture; by what I Ob&s;erv'd then, and by woful Ex|perience we have found it come to pa&s;s.
<PB N="iv" REF="4"> I have in the following Papers endea|voured to repre&s;ent the Cau&s;es of it. And the General Cau&s;e I have ob&s;erv'd to be, the Trading into tho&s;e Parts, whither but little of our own Manufacture is exported; and the Returns of Forreign Commodi|ties to us, are made by purcha&s;e with our Money. The Particulars of which, I have in&s;tanc'd in our Trade with <HI>France;</HI> which during the Two La&s;t Reigns, gave them the Advantage of near Four Milli|ons <HI>per Annum</HI> of our Money; while but little of our Manufactures was ex|chang'd for theirs. The like is in&s;tanc'd in the <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> Trade, which is mainly carried on by our Money, and the <HI>Calli|coes,</HI> &amp;c. which are imported from thence; not only hinder our own Manu|factures at Home, but lay a Foundation of the Lo&s;s of our Trade in the Wollen Ma|nufacture, both with <HI>Flanders</HI> and <HI>Ger|many.</HI> This Mr. <HI>T. Smith</HI> has hinted, in a Sheet he wrote the la&s;t Year, concern|ing the <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> Trade; &s;hewing how
<PB N="v" REF="4"> prejudicial it was to our Silk and Wollen Manufactures, which at pre&s;ent are well &s;etled among us. It tends to our Impo|veri&s;hment, by taking away the Employ|ment of our Poor; depopulates the Na|tion, le&s;&s;ens the Value of Lands and Hou&s;es; and expo&s;es us thereby to the Contempt of our Neighbours.</P>

<HEAD>An ALARUM, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P>IN the Preface of a Di&s;cour&s;e, Intituled, <HI>Awake Samp&s;on:</HI> Printed in the Year, 1696. I hinted that that was intended to be a Preparatory for a General Alarum.</P>
<P>Since we were told in the Year, 1678. that there was then a De&s;ign to &s;ubvert the Frame of our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Government, the De&s;truction of the Prote&s;tant Religion, and to adulterate the Coin, and had we took that caution given us timely, we had prevented many of tho&s;e Evils, which we have &s;o &s;en&s;ibly &s;ince felt.</P>
<P>And &s;ince the De&s;igns of our Enemies have been variou&s;ly exerci&s;ed, (<HI>viz.</HI>) to de&s;troy Trade, to invade Property, to alter on Religion, and to adulterate the Coin of the Nation, which hath co&s;t us &s;o much lately to retrieve; let it be a caution to us in other ca&s;es for the Future.</P>
<P>It may &s;eem to &s;ome to be needle&s;s now, to talk of an Alarum &s;eeing we are at Peace; yet the following Di&s;cour&s;e will evidence that in the Subject I in&s;i&s;t upon, we have more need to be call'd upon now, then in a Time of War: The Rea&s;ons are many, but in General, we know in War Watches are &s;et, and People do never &s;leep &s;ecure from Noi&s;e; but in a Time of Peace Per&s;ons are apt to be too &s;ecure: I pre&s;ume, there is no ju&s;t Occa&s;ion to make an Apology, for waking a Per&s;on in danger of a Fire, tho' he is forc'd to it again&s;t his Na|tural Di&s;po&s;ition; and that &s;uch a Per&s;on would
<PB N="2" REF="6"> not be offended, if pull'd out of his Bed when the Flames are about him; tho' he do not &s;ee it his Eyes being &s;hut, and he in a &s;ound &s;leep: It is the Condition of <HI>England</HI> at this time. We have been oft in Danger, and the Fire as oft quench'd, and tho' (generally &s;peaking) we have had very many and great awakening Providences &s;ounded in our Ears, <HI>Yet we have been like the deaf Addor that &s;toppeth her Ears, and will not hearken to the Voice of Charmers, tho' charming never &s;o wi&s;ely;</HI> and do not con&s;ider a Secret Train is laid to blow us up, and tho' we have hitherto been pre&s;erv'd almo&s;t to a Miracle, yet whether we have any grounds to expect it always, I cannot tell; my Faith is weak: But on the contrary, tho' we in this Age do not pretend to Prophetick In&s;piration, nor do I as little to Progno&s;tication, yet by Com|mon Ob&s;ervations any Man may predict, what Conclu&s;ions nece&s;&s;arily follow &s;uch and &s;uch Premi&s;&s;es; or in a more familiar way of &s;peak|ing, we know if we keep a certain Road on Shore, or &s;teer our Cour&s;e at Sea, whither at length it will bring us.</P>
<P>How we have taken our Cour&s;e the&s;e Forty Years is too Notorious, and for which the Land mourns; (I would be glad to be de|ceiv'd if my Fears are groundle&s;s) that it may vomit out many of its Inhabitants, at lea&s;t &s;ome of us fall &s;hort of our Expectations.</P>
<P>And had I not made &s;ome Ob&s;ervations, of the wonderful Goodne&s;s of God to this Na|tion; as before hinted: I &s;hould have de&s;pair'd of any hopes of being &s;aved from an utter De&s;truction, for the Dangers we are now in
<PB N="3" REF="6"> are &s;o great, that tho' we are at pre&s;ent (Ble&s;&s;ed be God) at peace, yet when I con&s;ider, the many thou&s;ands that have lived comfortably in the Trade of our Wollen Manufacture, and which have contributed to the Support of the Government, and Maintenance of the Poor; are now (and like to be more) reduced to want them&s;elves, having no Employment; by rea&s;on that many of tho&s;e Countries that we have formerly &s;upplied with tho&s;e Goods, do make not only for their own U&s;e with our Wool, but &s;up<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 span"> other Forreign Countries al&s;o; and not only &s;o, but that we have cut off as it were, and di&s;obliged both <HI>Ireland</HI> and <HI>Scot|land</HI> in &s;ome late Acts; I am not without my Fears what the Effects may be, be&s;ides our Dome&s;tick Con&s;umption of Forreign Manu|facturies, and hindring our own, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>But if it be &s;aid by &s;ome, (as it is) that if we loo&s;e our Woollen Manufacture, we may employ our poor in a Linnen Manu|facture, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> I mu&s;t an&s;wer as I did on a like Occa&s;ion, about the Year 1669. in a Tract, Entituled, <HI>England's Intere&s;t by the Benefit of the Woollen Manufacture: (viz.)</HI> <Q>I am the more large in the Demon&s;tration of this Affair, not only becau&s;e this hath co&s;t me many Years Labour and Study to con&s;ult all &s;orts of concern'd Per&s;ons, be&s;ides my own Ex|perience about it; but al&s;o becau&s;e it is &s;o hard to convince People of the meane&s;t Ca|pacity, and &s;ome of the wi&s;er &s;ort, how to cure this di&s;mal Malady which &s;ome de&s;pair|ing of, have rather thought of &s;etting up &s;ome other Manufacture in lieu of endeavour|ing
<PB N="4" REF="7"> to prevent the Exportation of Wool, and manufacturing that at Home, as that of Lin|nen, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which is in my Judgment a great Mi&s;take, for other Countries have the Ad|vantage of <HI>England</HI> in that, but not in this of Cloathing; and it will be found that all or mo&s;t Trades in <HI>England,</HI> wholly di&s;tinct from this of Cloathing, bring not the Tythe of Ad|vantage that this doth.</Q></P>
<P>And to confirm my Sentiments herein tho' &s;o long ago writ, I crave leave to add the Opi|nion of a late Author, who &s;ay<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter"></P>
<P><HI>Divine Providence that appoints to every Na|tion and Country a particular Portion, &s;eems to allot to</HI> England <HI>which was the fir&s;t Acceptable Sacrifice to his Omnipotence, that of the Flock the Produce of which, is the mo&s;t &V;niver&s;al Covering of all Civilized Countries of the World.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Our Wollen Manufacture is a Talent, which no Nation hath to that perfection as we have; this hath been for many Ages the Support of the Nation, imploying the Poore at home, and our Men and Ships at Sea. Now to decline this, and &s;et up another Manufactory, looks like an Extravagant Mechanick, who by his Improvidence hath lo&s;t his own Art, and thinks to retrieve his Mi&s;fortune by taking up that of another Mans: This is condemn'd in particular Per&s;ons, and therefore much more to be &s;o in a Community.</HI></P>
<P>But it will be &s;aid, <HI>There is not Imployment for the Hands of the Nation in the Wollen Manufactory; and &s;ince Linnen carries away &s;o much of our Money, it &s;eems the Intere&s;t of the Nation to imploy idle Hands, in that which will keep Money in the Kingdom.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Now tho' both the&s;e A&s;&s;ertions have too much
<PB N="5" REF="7"> Truth in them, yet neither of them have weight e|nough to enforce the Conclu&s;ion, That the Linnen Manufactory is the only Remedy. If we &s;earch into the Bottom of our Di&s;temper we &s;hall find another cau&s;e of our Di&s;ea&s;e.</HI></P>
<P><HI>It is not becau&s;e there is le&s;s Wollen Manufactory u&s;ed in the World than formerly, that our Trade de|clines, nor yet becau&s;e we make more than formerly; Nor is it altogether to be a&s;&s;igned to the late War: For that our Trade decay'd in the latter part of King</HI> Charles <HI>the Second, and all the Reign of the Late King. The Rea&s;ons then for our Decay in the Wollen Manufactory &s;eem to be the&s;e,</HI></P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. <HI>The Growth of Cour&s;e Wollen Manufactory in</HI> Germany, <HI>with which the</HI> Venetians <HI>Trade to</HI> Turkey.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. <HI>The Prohibition of our Wollen Manufactory in</HI> France.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. <HI>The Increa&s;e of the Wollen Manufactory by our Neighbours with the help of our Wool, &s;o that in &s;ome things they out-do us in the Price they can &s;ell at.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>4. <HI>By the great Wearing of</HI> Ea&s;t-India <HI>and other Silks, and the &V;&s;e of</HI> Calicoes, <HI>which was formerly &s;upply'd by our</HI> Tammies <HI>and</HI> Says.</ITEM>
<ITEM>5. <HI>The Want of the Con&s;umption of</HI> Ireland, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></ITEM>
</LIST>
<P><HI>Now if there be any thing in all I have &s;aid, it &s;eems rea&s;onable to con&s;ider well; before the Nation gives up its Staple and long-continued Trade for a Shadow, as I take the Linnen Manufactory to be: For although I believe it can never come to effect, yet &s;o far it may go, as to injure that of the Wollen, by diverting &s;ome that are now in it, and &s;o rai&s;eth
<PB N="6" REF="8"> price of Spinning; than which nothing can be more pre|judicial; for as I mention'd before, nothing can re|trieve our lo&s;t Trade abroad, but under&s;elling our Competitors: So then we mu&s;t labour to make ours as Cheap as we can, and not &s;et up another Manufactory. To bid who gives mo&s;t for Spinners, is a ready way to ruin the Cloathing Trade of</HI> England, <HI>but not to &s;et up the Linnen.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Let us con&s;ider, be&s;ides what hath been &s;aid be|fore of injuring the Wollen Manufactory: How it will affect the Kingdom in the two Pillars that &s;up|port it, That of the Rents of Land, and the Im|ploying our Ships and Men at Sea; which are thought the Walls of the Nation.</HI></P>
<P><HI>For the Rents of the Land they mu&s;t certainly fall, for that one Acre of Flax will employ as many Hands the Year round, as the Wool of Sheep that graze twenty Acres of Ground. The Linnen Manufactory im|ploys few Men, the Wollen mo&s;t, Weaving, Combing, Dre&s;&s;ing, Shearing, Dying,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>The&s;e eat and drink more than Women and Children, and &s;o as the Land that the &s;heep graze on rai&s;eth the Rent, &s;o will the Arable and Pa&s;ture that bears Corn, and breeds Cattel for their Sub&s;i&s;tance.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Then for the Employment of our Shipping, it will ne|ver be pretended that we can arrive to Exportation of Linnen; there are others and too many before us in that: And the Truth is, he that cannot thrive at his own Trade, will hardly do it in that of anothers. If we are beat out of our Inheritance the Wollen Manufactory by Forreigners, over whom we have &s;uch Advantages in our Wool, Fullers-Earth, and long Continuance in the Trade; it can be nothing le&s;s than a Miracle for us to take from them their Linnen Manufactory, in which they have &s;o much the A&s;cendant over us.</HI></P>
<PB N="7" REF="8">
<P><HI>I &s;hall end this part of my Di&s;cour&s;e with the An&s;wer of a We&s;t Country Man to his Neighbour, that ask'd, what Voyage he had made in a Fi&s;hing at</HI> New-found-land, <HI>that proved not good?</HI> I have made (<HI>&s;aid he</HI>) a brave Voyage, as you may gue&s;s, for I have &s;old my Bible, and bought a Tobacco-Box: <HI>Would it not be &s;o to this Nation, if we &s;hould change the Noble&s;t Manufactory in the World, for the poore&s;t and mo&s;t de&s;picable: So are tho&s;e People in all parts of the World, that are im|ployed in the Linnen Manufactory, which only thrives where the Country is crowded with Poor, and Bread not to be had, at the Charge of the Pari&s;h, where the Tenant is but a Va&s;&s;al to his Lord, and there is no power in any to relieve; but in the Lord who is &s;trange to the Practice. It is a Mi&s;take in them that believe the Linnen Manufactory in</HI> Hol|land, <HI>to be the Product of their own Country: It is only the ea&s;ier part, that of Weaving and Whiting, most of the Thread comes from</HI> Saxony.</P>
<P>Thus much for this Author, from whence we may Conclude, That if the Riches and Strength of <HI>England,</HI> were fir&s;t of all begun from our Wollen Manufacture by King <HI>Ed. 3d.</HI> and brought to a greater Perfection in the Reign of Queen <HI>Elizabeth;</HI> we al&s;o ought to take the &s;ame care in its pre&s;ervation: Otherwi&s;e we may be reduced to that mean Condition <HI>Eng|land</HI> was in, when Land and other Commodities was of no Value, till about the Time of that Famous Prince&s;s Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> who&s;e Long and Pro&s;perous Reign had rai&s;ed this Nation to that Riches and Strength, as el&s;ewhere is enlarged; and Sir <HI>Walter Raleigh,</HI> as a Wife
<PB N="8" REF="9"> State&s;-man, and Lover of his Country, (as many, if not mo&s;t of that Queen's Council were) had began well to promote <HI>Englands</HI> Intere&s;t, but was in the Reign of King <HI>James</HI> the Fir&s;t undermined by the Intere&s;t of <HI>Spain,</HI> which was then &s;o prevailing that that unfortunate Knight was taken away. But in the latter End of that Reign, and the whole of the three La&s;t Kings, in&s;tead of the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> the <HI>French</HI> Intere&s;t has &s;o much prevailed among&s;t us, that we are now under the &s;ad Effects thereof, and that King about the Year 1661. upon a De|&s;ign he had to have forbidden the Trade be|tween <HI>France</HI> and <HI>England,</HI> &s;uppo&s;ing the Va|lue of <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Commodities &s;ent into <HI>France,</HI> did &s;urmont the Value of tho&s;e that were tran&s;ported hither: The following Particulars were laid before that King.

<P>Upon which the <HI>French</HI> King &s;oon laid a&s;ide his De&s;ign of Prohibition, and in&s;tead thereof in|crea&s;ed the Duties laid upon all our Wollen Manufacture imported into his Dominions, of what was imported in the Year 1654. and 1660. (about which time we exported more Goods, e&s;pecially of our Wollen Manufactures to <HI>France,</HI> then was imported from <HI>France</HI> in|to <HI>England</HI> in tho&s;e Years.) But the great Increa&s;e of <HI>French</HI> Commodities imported into <HI>England,</HI> was after the Arrival of King <HI>Charles</HI> the Second. And we may rationally conclude, that the Duties paid to the <HI>French</HI> King when the afore&s;aid Goods, valu'd at 2600000 <HI>l.</HI> were
<PB N="10" REF="10"> exported, together with the Freight, and what was paid for Cu&s;tom when imported, as al&s;o the Profit to the Merchant and Retailer, and by the Advance of Price by our Fancies, the &s;aid Summ of 2600000 <HI>l.</HI> may be rationally increas'd to 3000000 <HI>l.</HI> &s;o that the Con&s;umers of the <HI>French</HI> Commodities advanced the <HI>French</HI> Intere&s;t and impoveri&s;hed our &s;elves; but then after this time in 1662. the <HI>French</HI> having got va&s;t Quantities of our Wool to encourage that Manufacture, great|er Duties were impo&s;ed on our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Commodities in the Year 1664. and further increa&s;ed in the Year 1667. not only on our Wollens but on all our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Commodities, even great Duties upon our Shipping, that I my &s;elf having occa&s;ion to go to <HI>Lille</HI> in <HI>Flan|ders,</HI> could not land at <HI>Dunkirk,</HI> tho' I had no Commodities in the Ve&s;&s;el without paying Tun|nage; but thi was not all, but the <HI>French</HI> King re&s;train'd and confin'd the Importation of our Wollen Manufactures to his Ports of <HI>Callice</HI> and <HI>Diep,</HI> and other Goods to &s;ome other in|convenient Ports: By which means, and by the Encouragement of the Con&s;umption of the Cloths, Stuffs, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> made by his own People; it amounted to a Prohibition of our Commodi|ties in many ca&s;es.</P>
<P>And by the way, it hath been examin'd that in the Year 1674. or thereabouts; there was imported from <HI>France</HI> Silks to the Value of 300000 <HI>l.</HI> and in Linnen Cloth 500000 <HI>l.</HI> and Wine and Brandy, 217000 <HI>l.</HI> where we may al&s;o Note, that if &s;uch a Quantity was legally enter'd, there was &s;ome of all

This in my Judg|ment being impartial (<HI>viz.</HI>) (not concern'd in Intere&s;t) mu&s;t in rea&s;on be the main Occa|&s;ion;
<PB N="13" REF="11"> at lea&s;t a Foundation for <HI>Germany</HI> and <HI>Flanders,</HI> to encourage the Wollen Manufactury in tho&s;e parts: And it's well Ob&s;erv'd by the Author of a little Tract, Intituled, <HI>The Inte|re&s;t of</HI> England <HI>con&s;ider'd;</HI> Printed in the Year 1694. (<HI>viz.</HI>)</P>
<P><HI>The fine Linnens of</HI> Flanders <HI>and</HI> Germany, <HI>have come in competition the&s;e many Years with the Calicoes and Mu&s;lings of the</HI> Ea&s;t-Indies; <HI>and the fine Dowlace and Gau&s;es of</HI> France, <HI>one the Effect of our Manufactory, the other of our Bul|lion, and yet you will find upon the Book of Rates, if I mi&s;take not, all the Linnen of</HI> Flanders <HI>charged with about three pence an Ell Cu&s;tome, and the fine Dowlace of</HI> France <HI>not at one half penny; and the Callicoes of the</HI> Ea&s;t-Indies <HI>but at two pence a piece.</HI></P>
<P>Now as that unequal Trade was carried on, all the time almo&s;t of the two Late Reigns, &s;o the Nece&s;&s;ity in the late War in doubling the Duties upon <HI>Flanders</HI> Linnen, which is almo&s;t half the Value of much of their &s;aid Linnen, and the un&s;ea&s;onable timing of the Lace Act, which did (as was lately affirm'd in a Committee, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>) occa&s;ion a <HI>Flanders</HI> Merchant then in <HI>London,</HI> dealing much in Lace, to go over to <HI>Flanders,</HI> and put the States upon the prohibiting our Wollen Manufacture.</P>
<P>And tho' this occa&s;ion'd the &s;aid Prohibition, yet con&s;idering the Little Quantity of Lace, at lea&s;t vi&s;ibly brought into <HI>England,</HI> in compari&s;on of the Linnen imported formerly from <HI>Flanders;</HI> cannot be the Original, tho' it may be the In|&s;trumental Cau&s;e as before hinted.</P>
<P>Hereby it may appear how we have lo&s;t our
<PB N="14" REF="12"> Trade, and how in&s;en&s;ibly our Trea&s;ure was exhau&s;ted, and our Nation beggar'd, whil&s;t we neglected our own Intere&s;t, and Strangers (&s;uch as proved our great Enemies) were di|ligent to make their Advantage by us, but mo&s;t of tho&s;e Evils might have been prevented, had we really a&s;&s;um'd our Ance&s;tors regard to our Wealth and Grandeur.</P>
<P>But leaving Particulars let us be more ge|neral, for tho' we are agreed, that Trade is the main Spring from whence Riches flow, yet we do as much differ in the Method of ac|quiring thereof, and there is certainly as much need of Regulation in Trade, as of Laws to &s;ecure one Man's Right from being invaded by another, for it's now become as nece&s;&s;ary to pre&s;erve Government, as it is u&s;eful to make Men rich.</P>
<P>And notwith&s;tanding the great Influence, that Trade now hath in the Support and Wel|fare of States and Kingdoms, yet there is no|thing more unknown, or at lea&s;t that Men differ more in their Sentiments; than about the true Cau&s;es that rai&s;e and promote Trade.</P>
<P>The Merchant and other Traders, who &s;hould under&s;tand the true Intere&s;t of Trade, do either not under&s;tand it, or el&s;e le&s;t it might hinder their private Gain, will not di&s;|cover it.</P>
<P>Some Writers about Trade, do in their Treati&s;es better &s;et forth the Rule to make an Ac|compli&s;h'd Merchant, than how it may be mo&s;t profitable to the Nation. And tho&s;e Argu|ments every day met with from the Traders, &s;eem bya&s;&s;ed with private Intere&s;t, and run
<PB N="15" REF="12"> contrary to one anothers, as their Intere&s;t are oppo&s;ite.</P>
<P>And how fair and convincing &s;oever their Premi&s;es may appear, for the Enlarging and Advancement of Trade; the Conclu&s;ions of their Arguments, are directly oppo&s;ite.</P>
<P>The Rea&s;ons why many Men have not a true Idea of Trade is, Becau&s;e they apply their Thoughts to particular Parts of Trade, where|in they are chiefly concern'd in Intere&s;t; and having found out the be&s;t Rules and Laws for forming that particular Part, they govern their Thoughts by the &s;ame Notions in forming the great Body of Trade, and not reflecting on the different Proportion betwixt the Body <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">nd Parts, have a very di&s;agreeable Concep|tion; and like tho&s;e, who having learnt to draw well an Eye, Ear, Hand, and other Parts of the Body, (being unskilful in the Laws of Symmetry) when they join them together make a very deformed Body.</P>
<P>Therefore whoever will make a true Repre|&s;entation of Trade, mu&s;t draw a rough Scetch of the Body and Parts together, which though it will not entertain with &s;o much Plea&s;ure as a well fini&s;h'd Peice; yet the agreablene&s;s of the Parts may be as well di&s;cern'd, and thereby &s;uch Mea&s;ures taken, as may be&s;t &s;uit the Shape of the Body.</P>
<P>The Rea&s;on why I u&s;e this &s;imilitude, is from the Experience we have of the mi&s;erable Effects we now, and may more hereafter feel of this &s;eparate Trades that have been carried on in this Kingdom, (<HI>viz.</HI>) that &s;ome few Per|&s;ons gain great E&s;tates, when the Nation in
<PB N="16" REF="13"> general decays, as in many Particulars may be in&s;tanc'd, (<HI>viz.</HI>) the <HI>French</HI> Trade all the Time of the two late Kings, that &s;uch Merchants who imported va&s;t Quantities (and &s;ome that run their Goods and paid no Cu&s;toms) of &s;uch Commodities that were purcha&s;ed with Money, and tended to debauch the Nation, then the <HI>Ea&s;t-India,</HI> by both tho&s;e Countries this Nation hath le&s;&s;en'd the Employment of near Five Hundred Thou&s;and Per&s;ons, for by &s;uch a Number of Per&s;ons out of Employ, or double that Number but half Work; it's all one the Nation mu&s;t be greatly impoveri&s;hed thereby: For before that time when People were fully imployed, &s;ome Families could earn in the Cloathing Trade by &s;pinning and weav|ing Twenty, and &s;ome Thirty Shillings <HI>per Week,</HI> tho' &s;ome le&s;s, others more; which was mo&s;t &s;pent by them, and laid out with the Farmer and Gra&s;ier, who was thereby better able to pay their Rents to the Nobility and Gentry; by which means the Value of Lands were kept up, but when &s;uch a Number of Per&s;ons beforementioned had no Employment, it's not probable the Commodities can be &s;old which nece&s;&s;arily &s;unk the Rents of Lands, and this was the Occa&s;ion of the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Act, (as that before of Corn) to prohibit the Im|portation of Cattle, &s;uppo&s;ing that would be a means to &s;upport the Value of Lands in <HI>England:</HI> But the Mi&s;take is now &s;o manife&s;t, that we have by it lo&s;t a great part of our Trade, and laid a Foundation to loo&s;e all, and it was well Ob&s;erved by Mr. <HI>Tho. Manly,</HI> a Ju&s;tice of Peace in <HI>Kent,</HI> &s;hortly after that
<PB N="17" REF="13"> Act pa&s;t upon another Occa&s;ion about the Ex|portation of Wool; <HI>(viz.)

<P>For if it be true, as is by &s;ome affirm'd, (and by Demon&s;trations made good) that <HI>England</HI> gain'd by the Trade with <HI>Ireland</HI> before, and in the beginning of the Reign of King <HI>Charles</HI> the Second, Two Millions <HI>per Annum:</HI> It is plain, that Act laid the Foundation of our ruin, for before that Act was in force, the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> con|tented them&s;elves with Trading only with <HI>England,</HI> by which Trade we received &s;o great an Advantage, but &s;ince the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> have been nece&s;&s;itated to &s;eek for a Trade el&s;ewhere, which they have found to be our Lo&s;s. And tho' the late Act about the Wollen Manufacture in <HI>Ireland,</HI> was well intended to encourage our own; yet as things now &s;tand, I am not with|out my Fears that it will not be &s;o advanta|gious as was expected, and as it might have been done another way: I would be glad if I am deceiv'd in my Fears.</P>
<P>Before I pa&s;s <HI>Ireland,</HI> I would crave leave to in&s;ert a part of a Di&s;cour&s;e writ by Mr. <HI>An|drew Marvyl,</HI> and printed in the Year, 1677. (<HI>viz.</HI>)</P>
<P><HI>The fall of Rents, and cheapne&s;s of Wool, and decay of Manufacture in</HI> England, <HI>being &s;ugge&s;ted to be principally occa&s;ion'd by</HI> Ireland, <HI>the</HI> Iri&s;h <HI>Cattle were thereupon prohibited by an Act of Par|liament, and declared to be a publick Nu&s;ance.</HI></P>
<PB N="18" REF="14">
<P><HI>Admitting that &s;ome of tho&s;e Counties might be be prejudiced by the Importation of</HI> Iri&s;h <HI>Cattle, yet what&s;oever Profit accrued to others by it, did upon the mutual Nece&s;&s;ities of all, &s;ettle into the Common Stock of the Nation.</HI></P>
<P><HI>And it &s;eems but rea&s;onable, that what&s;oever private Obligation a Parliament Man hath to the Place where he is Elected; yet when once he comes to &s;it, his Tru&s;t and his Mind is enlarg'd, and he does no more con&s;ider him&s;elf as the Politician of a Shire, or the Patron of a Burrough, but as a Repre&s;enter of the &V;niver&s;ality: Whereas otherwi&s;e, if any County, one or more chance to be more fer|tile than other in Members of Parliament, and they act by &s;uch narrow Mea&s;ures, the deci&s;ion would be by Multitude, not by Rea&s;on.</HI></P>
<P><HI>And notwith&s;tanding if we were to tell Counties, tho&s;e that are not advantaged and are really agrieved, make the greate&s;t Plea; for if we account like Mer|chants by Profit and Lo&s;s, all the Profit that can be made (and that very &s;mall) by this Act, returns to &s;uch Counties which are proper for breeding, and that &s;mall profit is lo&s;t to them, if not much more by their Corn for want of Trade by it, and the whole Nation hath hereby lo&s;t in great mea&s;ure, the vent of it's Home and Forreign Commodities to</HI> Ireland, <HI>and the increa&s;ing Product to</HI> England <HI>in General, by</HI> Iri&s;h <HI>Cattle in</HI> Specie.</P>
<P><HI>But as to the Political Point, you did herein as much as in you then lay, to cut off all that &s;trong as more natural Dependance of</HI> Ireland <HI>upon</HI> England, <HI>and to govern it rather by force of Authority, than by the influential Benignity of Intere&s;t. And tho' I am no Polititian, dare &s;ay in General, that it concerns you to u&s;e us kindly, and to indulge us
<PB N="19" REF="14"> in all things that tend to civilize, cultivate, and people this Nation.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Memorandum,</HI> This was written by Mr. <HI>Marvyl,</HI> under the Notion of a younger Brother in <HI>Ireland</HI> to an Elder Brother in <HI>England;</HI> the rea&s;on was that it might not be thought his Writing, becau&s;e he was not willing to di&s;|oblige the <HI>North</HI> Country Members, being his Friends, they being for that Act.</P>
<P>The next Act was about Leather, the Effect of which hath le&s;&s;en'd the Employment of many Thou&s;ands in that Manufacture; &s;o that Act hath given Advantage to Forreigners, contra|ry to the de&s;ign of the &s;aid Laws, and more par|ticularly one lately made in the <HI>12th.</HI> Year of <HI>Car.</HI> 2. as by the Preamble of that Act may appear; wherein 'tis Evident that the De&s;ign thereof was for,</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. The &s;etting on work the Inhabitants of this Realm.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. The Improving the Native Commodities of this Country to it's be&s;t, fulle&s;t and utmo&s;t U&s;e.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. And that the Advantage accrewing here|by, might redound to the Subjects of this King|dom, and not the Subjects of Forreign Realms.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>Wherefore the&s;e three De&s;igns were either good, and &s;ufficient Motives for the Prohibi|tion therein expre&s;t or not; if Good and Sin|cere, then what&s;oever is contrary mu&s;t be to the prejudice of <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>So that if tho&s;e Acts before-mentioned are con|trary to the true Intere&s;t of <HI>England,</HI> and notwith|&s;tanding have produced Effects contrary to Ex|pectation, we ought to con&s;ider whether it be pro|per that the &s;aid Acts &s;hould &s;till remain in force.</P>
<PB N="20" REF="15">
<P>And then we added another Mi&s;take, upon a Suppo&s;ition that if Forreigners had a liberty equal to our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Merchants, it would un|avoidably encourage and encrea&s;e Trade; and therefore Aliens Duties were taken off; the Effect of which hath, in&s;tead of that, laid a Foundation to loo&s;e the Freedom of the <HI>Eng|li&s;h</HI> Merchant, and let Strangers into the My|&s;tery and Advantage of our Manufacture, as well as ruin many of the Wollen Manufactures of this Kingdom, for when tho&s;e Forreigners have got &s;ome Credit, they have engro&s;&s;ed va&s;t Quantities of the &s;aid Manufacture, and then leave the King|dom: So that all tho&s;e Acts before-mentioned, in|&s;tead of promoting have tended to de&s;troy our Trade; and had not the late War fell out as it did, (which occa&s;ion'd the Con&s;umption of &s;o much Fle&s;h and Corn in the Fleet and Army) it had been much wor&s;e than now it is for the Far|mer and Grazier. Be&s;ides the General Decay of our Trade, which we &s;hould e're this time been more &s;en&s;ible of. I &s;ay again, had not the War came on at that time, we had not only lo&s;t our Trade, but the Liberty of Free-born <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Men.</P>
<P>And now we have Peace (generally &s;peak|ing) there is much cau&s;e upon another Ac|count, to be afraid we &s;hall bring De&s;truction upon our &s;elves by the Methods u&s;ed, now to promote a forreign Intere&s;t, as we did <HI>France</HI> in the Two late Reigns; and tho' we are daily told of our Danger, yet we will not credit tho&s;e Cautions given us. Which brings to my Mind the Hi&s;tory of the <HI>Jews,</HI> who tho' they were often told of their De&s;truction that would
<PB N="21" REF="15"> certainly come upon them, if they continu'd to go on in tho&s;e ways in which they were then walking; and tho' this Warning was given 'em with the greate&s;t Compa&s;&s;ion that a Man cou'd expre&s;s, and all imaginable pains taken to convince them of the certainty of tho&s;e Evils that were coming upon them; yet they re|jected all good Coun&s;el, and &s;lighted all the Reproofs that were given them by their Pro|phets, until at la&s;t De&s;truction came upon them to the uttermo&s;t, and there was no Re|medy.</P>
<P>I would al&s;o crave leave to in&s;tance in the Ca&s;e of the <HI>Grecian</HI> Chri&s;tians at <HI>Con&s;tantinople;</HI> that notwith&s;tanding the many Warnings given them of the De&s;igns of the <HI>Turks</HI> again&s;t them; yet how carele&s;s and in&s;en&s;ible they were, and wou'd not make that provi&s;ion for their De|fence which was required of them, and there|fore, the Effects of that Carele&s;ne&s;s was felt by them, when the <HI>Turks</HI> came to po&s;&s;e&s;s that great City: For at the taking of it by <HI>Maho|met</HI> the Great, <HI>At which time the Riches of the Conquer'd was no better than Poverty, and Beauty wor&s;e than Deformity; but to &s;peak of the hidden Trea&s;ure there found, pa&s;&s;eth credit; the</HI> Turks <HI>them&s;elves wondering thereat: Whereof if &s;ome part had in time been be&s;towed upon the Defence of the City, the</HI> Turki&s;h <HI>King had not &s;o ea&s;ily taken both it and the City. But every man (as now we here) was careful how to encrea&s;e his private Wealth, few or none regarding the publick State; (it's &s;till our ca&s;e) until in fine every Man with his private Abundance, was wrapped together with his needy Neighbour in the &s;elf &s;ame common Mi&s;ery,
<PB N="22" REF="16"> (and who knows what may fall out of the &s;ame kind hereafter) yet the &s;ecurity of the</HI> Con&s;tantinopoli|tans <HI>was &s;uch, that tho' they were always environ'd with their mortal Enemies, yet had they no care of fortifying &s;o much as the Inner Wall of the City, but &s;uffer'd the Officers, (which had the Charge of it) to convert the greate&s;t part of the Money into their own Pur&s;e.</HI></P>
<P>I dread to name my Fears, if <HI>England,</HI> which (for many Generations) hath been &s;o Famous to all the World, &s;hould now be given up to ruin, and be a prey to our Neighbours, and thereby a Scorn and a By-word to the World, by the Evil Practices of it's own Natives; but were we unanimous and true to our real <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Intere&s;t, we need not fear all the World; but on the contrary if we per&s;i&s;t in that de|&s;tructive Practice of private Intere&s;t, what Mi|&s;ery may not ju&s;tly be expected by us, when we are &s;o in&s;en&s;ible of the Train that has been &s;o long laid to blow up tho&s;e good Foundations, (which have been &s;o many Ages agoe e&s;tabli&s;hed by our Noble Ance&s;tors) of all our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Liberties and Properties: For I know no Nation under Heaven, as at this Day en|joying tho&s;e Priviledges we do.</P>

<PB N="23" REF="16"> awaken us out of that General Lethargy we are fallen into, I &s;hould greatly rejoyce; however, I &s;hall endeavour to quiet an unea&s;ie Mind, by di&s;charging it this way, in giving &s;ome Account of that which hath occa&s;ion'd my Fears.</P>
<P>This Nation is hitherto own'd a Free People, but now long that Freedom may be enjoy'd no Mortal can conclude; for if we do (as we ought) &s;eriou&s;ly reflect on the condition of mo&s;t Parts of the World, and more particu|larly many of our neighbouring Nations, how they have lo&s;t their Liberties and Priviledges they formerly enjoyed, and con&s;ider how we at pre&s;ent are upheld, and the Dangers we are in by our own Folly, and if we did but a little deny our &s;elves, (tho' &s;uppos'd) pre|&s;ent &s;elf-denial, and really pur&s;ue our real and true <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Intere&s;t (<HI>viz.</HI>) if I as a private Per&s;on or in Company carry on a Trade that may be advantagious to my &s;elf and Com|pany, which may not only be prejudicial to a greater Number, but tend to the de&s;truction of the whole Kingdom, and peradventure my &s;elf at la&s;t; I therefore in &s;uch a ca&s;e ought to deny my &s;elf in my private and &s;uppos'd pro|fit; and by this happily pre&s;erve the re&s;t from De&s;truction: For if through the Lo&s;s of our Manufacture &s;ome Hundreds of Thou&s;ands have no Employ, Hunger breaks through all Laws, we may not forget what happened not many Years &s;ince of the <HI>Weavers</HI> in <HI>Spittle|fields,</HI> and if that was &s;o dangerous in one branch of Trade then failing, and but part of this City of <HI>London;</HI> what may we

<P><HI>I have hitherto given my Ob&s;ervations and Thoughts in general, how all Nations have ac|quir'd their proportions of Gold and Silver, and that they have mo&s;t, who depend lea&s;t on their Native Product; Art and Labour are the only Philo&s;ophers Stone, that turns the Product of the Earth into Gold.</HI></P>

<P><HI>We are an Original in every thing and that I take to be our Misfortune, as it might have been our Happine&s;s; for certainly no Civilized People in the World, would make &s;o little of &s;uch Ine&s;timable Funds as we have to work upon; what would the</HI> Dutch <HI>(and to our &s;hame, we may now bring in the</HI> French) <HI>do, if they had our Mines of Lead, and Tin, our Fleeces of Wool,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>And to com|pleat all, an Indu&s;trious and Ingenuous</HI> People <HI>to manufacture and improve them.

<P>In the Year 1669. was laid before King <HI>Charles</HI> the <HI>Second</HI> an Account, by what ways the Trade and Riches of <HI>England</HI> was begun, and al&s;o how it was undermin'd, and after|wards at &s;everal times Propo&s;als conducing to our Pre&s;ervation, was al&s;o laid before that Prince, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>And in the Year 1677. was publi&s;hed in Print by divers Per&s;ons, and more particularly by Mr. <HI>Andrew Marvyl,</HI> what Evil Con&s;e|quence the Exportation of our Wool to <HI>France</HI> was to <HI>England;</HI> and that there had been for &s;ome Years near Twenty thou&s;and Packs an|nually imported into the Town of <HI>Callice,</HI>
<PB N="28" REF="19"> and much of it from <HI>Kent;</HI> that before &s;uch Quantities of Wool were exported, there was a con&s;iderable Trade of the Wollen Manufacture in that Country; but it's now almo&s;t lo&s;t, and yet &s;ome Per&s;ons of that Country favouring the Exportation of Wool, in their Prints &s;eem to be plea&s;ed, that they have the le&s;s poor in their Country thereby; it's nece&s;&s;ary for &s;uch to con&s;ider, what they would do with the Sheep and Bullocks brought up to <HI>London,</HI> if all other Countries now employed in Wollen Manufa|cture brought up thither (which is the grand Wheel that carries on Trade) were as much depopulated as <HI>Kent.</HI></P>
<P>Give me leave to compare Profit and Lo&s;s, &s;uppo&s;e <HI>Kent</HI> was the only County in <HI>England</HI> which produced Wool, and that 6000 Packs were yearly grown there, and put the Rate of 10 <HI>l. per Pack,</HI> which amounts to 60000 <HI>l.</HI> and &s;o exported rough, but if that Wool was ma|nufactur'd in <HI>Kent,</HI> and then exported, it would amount to 720000. &s;o take out the 60000 <HI>l.</HI> for the Wool, <HI>Kent</HI> would have gain'd 660000 <HI>l.</HI> but now <HI>France</HI> hath got it; and as they have ta&s;ted the &s;weetne&s;s, and found the &s;innes of our Trade, &s;o they have not &s;pared any Co&s;t to gain it from us, by getting our Wool, either by Craft or Force, for there was not more Art and Skill u&s;ed by King <HI>Ed.</HI> 3. in bringing home the Wollen Manufacturers at fir&s;t to the Wool, than hath been of late to export it to <HI>France;</HI> the Con&s;equence of which is not only injuri|ous to us, in the lo&s;s of what we formerly ex|ported of our Wollen Manufacture thither, but al|&s;o by their &s;upplying Forreign Markets with the
<PB N="29" REF="19"> Manufacture made with our Wool much cheaper than we, by rea&s;on of the cheap Workman&s;hip in <HI>France,</HI> the which is three or four times the Value of the Wool; which if the <HI>French</HI> had not our Wool, they could not make any con&s;ide|rable Quantity of the Wollen Manufacture (<HI>viz.</HI>) Wor&s;ted, Stuffs and Stockings, which is now a Con&s;iderable Part of our Wollen Manufacture.</P>
<P>But this is not all, but we have been im|po&s;ed upon by the Con&s;umption of the <HI>French</HI> Manufactury in our own wearing, all the Reign of the two late Kings, which was very great before the late War; but &s;ince by the great Encrea&s;e of <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> Commodities, the <HI>French</HI> have been under&s;old: So that from the whole matter, we have not only lo&s;t a great part of the Export of our Wollen Manufacture and in a way to lo&s;e all, but much of the Con&s;ump|tion of our own wearing; the Evil Con&s;equence of which, I fear we &s;hall too &s;en&s;ibly feel, and to take Notice what is already pa&s;t; as is very well Ob&s;erved by Mr. <HI>Tho. Smith,</HI> in a Tract printed the la&s;t Year, which he hath al&s;o pub|li&s;hed another; Intituled, <HI>Profit and Lo&s;s.</HI></P>
<P>As to the Fir&s;t, The ruin of the <HI>Tammy</HI> and <HI>Green&s;ay</HI> Trade, &s;etled in <HI>Suffolk</HI> and <HI>Norfolk</HI> for many years, the U&s;e of the&s;e Commodies was for our Home Con&s;umption, which be|twixt Twenty or Thirty Years agoe, the <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> Company brought over &s;uch Quantities of <HI>Callicoes</HI> &s;tain'd, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which wholly turn'd tho&s;e of our Commodities out of doors, not only the Wear here, but the Export of it to <HI>Ireland, Scotland,</HI> and our Plantations, and the
<PB N="30" REF="20"> People employed forced to leave their Hou&s;es, which &s;tanding empty where Trade&s;men in|habited, Landlords abating 20 <HI>l. per Cent.</HI> of their Rent, nay, offering large good Hou&s;es to any that would keep them in repair, which did al&s;o affect the Counties of <HI>Lincoln, Lei|ce&s;ter, Northampton,</HI> and <HI>Warwick</HI> by the Fall of the price of Wool at that time.</P>
<P>The next In&s;tance is in <HI>Spittle-fields,</HI> there was fir&s;t the <HI>Walloons,</HI> and &s;ince by the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> a very large Silk Manufacture &s;etled, till the <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> Company &s;ent Patterns and Workmen unto the <HI>Indies,</HI> and by that means beat the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> out of that Trade.</P>
<P>A third In&s;tance is, the <HI>Gloce&s;ter-&s;hire</HI> Cloth exported by the <HI>Turkey</HI> Merchants, which brings home Silk and Grogrin Yarn in return, which by the means of the <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> Commodities, the &s;aid Merchants Effects lye upon their Hands, and in&s;tead of Exporting 30000 Cloaths in a Year, now 5000 &s;erve the turn.</P>
<P>The la&s;t In&s;tance is, the mi&s;erable Condi|tion of the Manufacturers of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> the&s;e People are Weavers of Silk, the Foundation of which Trade was laid in the time of Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> when the Nobility and Gentry of <HI>England</HI> were in earne&s;t to advance the Na|tion; when the Trades of <HI>Norwich, Colche&s;ter, London, Exon</HI> and <HI>Canterbury</HI> had their Origi|nal, and greatly encouraged: And this of <HI>Can|terbury</HI> I &s;hall particularly mention, what fell out betwixt the Years, 1697, and 1698.</P>
<P>The Traders in <HI>Canterbury</HI> upon &s;ome pro|&s;pect of Trade, provided Quantities of Goods
<PB N="31" REF="20"> for the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and <HI>We&s;t-India</HI> Markets, but the coming in of <HI>Indian</HI> Damask in the <HI>Fleet</HI> Frigot; the &s;aid <HI>Canterbury</HI> Men were ruined, unle&s;s they could have metamorpho&s;ed their Tabbies, made of very rich <HI>Italian</HI> Silk, that came in Exchange for <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Serge, into <HI>In|dian</HI> Silk; they mu&s;t leave Trading, or &s;ell at 30 or 40. <HI>per Cent.</HI> lo&s;s: By which means, half the Workmen of that Town of the weaving Trade, are now running up and down the Nation &s;eeking Bread, and their Families left to the Pari&s;hes to maintain, and the Trade by which that Town hath been upheld for an Hundred Years come to nothing: The&s;e are &s;ome of the pa&s;t Effects of the <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> Trade, with re&s;pect to the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Manufactury; and who &s;hall pay the Damage?</P>
<P>The next Thing to be con&s;ider'd is, what further Mi&s;chief this Trade may do to the other Manufactures of <HI>England,</HI> and this is to be Evidenced upon what they have begun and tryed upon; and partly upon this Suppo&s;ition, that whatever Commodity is made in <HI>England</HI> of Wool, may be imitated, and in many re|&s;pects exceeded in <HI>Cotton</HI> manufactured in <HI>India,</HI> and be afforded cheaper than our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Trade&s;|men can afford theirs, and be New and Odd, and &s;o plea&s;ing, that it will be the Intere&s;t of the <HI>Indian</HI> Traders to encourage &s;uch Trades.</P>
<P>They have already brought over great Quan|tities of double Callicoes, u&s;ed in the room of <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Flannels for Shifts and other U&s;es; be&s;ides great Quantities of Cotton Stockings, which are both worn here, and exported to the <HI>We&s;t-Indies.</HI></P>
<PB N="32" REF="21">
<P>As for Stuffs, they have brought already great Quantities of Cotton Stuffs, dyed, &s;trip|ped, plain, mixed Colour, in the directe&s;t op|po&s;ition to Wollen Stuffs.</P>
<P>As for Silk and Cotton mixed, it were al|mo&s;t Endle&s;s to give an Account how many &s;orts of <HI>Norwich</HI> and <HI>London</HI> Stuffs, that are made of Silk and <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Wool, they have imitated and outdone as to Price in Silk and Cotton, but we may Note, that the <HI>New-Drapery</HI> &s;o called is much more than <HI>Old.</HI></P>
<P>But &s;uppo&s;e all tho&s;e Manufactures &s;hould be ruin'd, &s;ure they cannot hurt the Cloth Trade; &s;ay the Agents of the <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> Company. In An&s;wer, Why may not a Commodity made of Cotton put down Cloth. Cotton is as fine and &s;oft as Wool, it may be &s;pun as &s;mall or as large, it may be mill'd and dre&s;s'd dyed and &s;tained, and when the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Merchant &s;hall &s;end over Cloth-weavers, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> I que&s;tion not but we &s;hall have Cotton Cloth, and Knaves to make it a Fa&s;hion, and Fools enough to wear it; and though tho&s;e Calamities are upon us, and many more in view, though nothing but employing our People can pre|&s;erve this Nation; yet that Trade mu&s;t be free, tho' it brings the Nation in Bondage, whereas formerly a Million at lea&s;t were em|ployed in the Wollen Manufacture, who were In&s;trumental in di&s;tributing near Four Mil|lions <HI>per Annum</HI> for Bread and other <HI>Nece&s;&s;a|ries,</HI> which the Graziers and Farmers (Ten|nants to the Nobility and Gentry) received; which Per&s;ons al&s;o did bear part of the Taxes which &s;upported the Government, and

<P>TIS evident that our Wollen Goods are &s;old in &s;everal Countries, namely, <HI>Holland, Ham|burgh,
<PB N="39" REF="24"> Germany,</HI> the <HI>Hans</HI> Towns, and all the <HI>Ea&s;t</HI> Countries; many of which Places will not be able to take off our Wollen Goods, unle&s;s we deal for their Linnens. And in Fact, and by Ex|perience, it has been &s;een in the Ca&s;e of the <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> Trade, &s;ince there has been imported from thence va&s;t Quantities of Linnens, &s;uch as <HI>Calli|coes, Mu&s;lins, Romals</HI> for Handkerchiefs, which an|&s;wered the ends of <HI>Lawns, Cambricks</HI> and other Linnen Cloth, we have not exported that va&s;t Quantity of Drapery to tho&s;e <HI>Northern</HI> Parts, of which Sir <HI>Walter Rawleigh</HI> makes mention. As our Call for their Linnens had dimini&s;hed, their Call for our Draperies has proportionably decreas'd; and not only &s;o, but the&s;e People have been com|pelled by Nece&s;&s;ity to fall upon making cour&s;e Wollen Cloth, by which they &s;upply them&s;elves and other places, which we were wont to furni&s;h.</P>
