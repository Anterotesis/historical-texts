<P>ON <HI>Monday</HI> the 21&s;t. of <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> 1689. about Eight of the Clock in the Morning, his Grace the Duke of <HI>Schonberg,</HI> with fourteen Regiments of Foot, &s;ailed from <HI>High-lake,</HI> and &s;afely landed at <HI>Banger,</HI> about One of the Clock in the Afternoon of the day following; upon the appea|rance of the Fleet, &s;everal &s;mall Boats came from the Shoar, at lea&s;t two Leagues to meet it, to give an Account of the Country and the Harbours thereabouts, as al&s;o giving an Account of the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Army, both Hor&s;e, Dragoons, and Foot, flying from their Quarters upon the News of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Army Landing. So great was the Con|&s;ternation among&s;t them, that &s;everal ran as far as <HI>Newry,</HI> being 36 Miles, before they &s;topt, to know either the quality or quantity of the Army. The appearance of our Fleet did &s;o much comfort the Prote&s;tants of that Country, that the Shoar was covered with Hor&s;es, Cows, and Sheep for the benefit and advantage of the Army, and Provi&s;ions of all &s;orts being &s;o plentifully brought in; a quarter of good Mutton was &s;old at four pence, and every thing el&s;e at very rea&s;onable rates. The General made Mr. <HI>Hamilton</HI>'s Hou&s;e at <HI>Banger</HI> his head Quarters, and giving Orders that all Men &s;hould on pain of Death &s;tand to Arms all that Night, having fir&s;t very advantagiou&s;ly lined &s;ome Hedges and Ditches with &s;mall Shot. At Night an Allarm was in the Camp of the Enemies approach; whereupon the whole Army was re&s;olved to main|tain their Ground, but this afterwards appeared a Stratagem of War, to try the Mens courage in ca&s;e the Enemy had really attackt them. The next day the General received Advice, that the Enemy then at <HI>Car|rickfergus</HI> were intended to Plunder and Burn the Towns of <HI>Belfa&s;t</HI> and <HI>Lisburn;</HI> whereupon Collonel <HI>Wharton</HI>'s Regiment of Foot were im|mediately ordered to March from the Camp at <HI>Banger</HI> to <HI>Belfa&s;t,</HI> which was &s;aved from Plunder and Fire, &s;ome of the Enemy being killed, and others taken Pri&s;oners: Within two or three days afterwards, the Army decampt from <HI>Banger,</HI> and encampt at <HI>Belfa&s;t</HI> for two Nights, and then moved in order to the be&s;ieging of the Town and Ca&s;tle of <HI>Carick|fergus:</HI> on our approach again&s;t that place the General &s;ummoned the Town by a Drum, and a Parley was agreed to, but the be&s;ieged in&s;i&s;t|ing upon very great Conditions, <HI>viz.</HI> to March out with flying Colours, Arms, Baggage, and Plunder, then pretended to be their Property; the General would not agree to them, but in regard there were many Prote&s;tants in the Town, was willing to comply on rea&s;onable Terms, but the be&s;ieged utterly refu&s;ed any manner of Conditions, other than what they had propo&s;ed, and if &s;uch were not agreed to, would di&s;pute the Town, which the General his Grace finding them &s;o ob&s;tinate, or|dered 4 Battering Guns, and 2 Morter Pieces, to be planted at the Pi|geon hou&s;e very near the Town, and played for a con&s;iderable time hotly again&s;t the Ca&s;tle and Town, while the lines of Circumvallation were flinging up, and then Batteries were rai&s;ed on the lines, but being at too great a di&s;tance, no great prejudice was done; the General ob|&s;erving the Batteries to be at great di&s;tance, did in Per&s;on ride within 40 paces of the Walls, and appointed the Ground for a new Battery, and running the line of Circumvallation, &s;o that the next day 6 Pieces of Cannon and 2 Morters were drawn up to that Ground; from this Battery the Be&s;iege were &s;o warmly &s;aluted with our 6 Cannon, one Morter ca&s;ting Shells of 600 <HI>l.</HI> weight, and the other flinging 9 &s;mall Shells at once into the Town, with a continued Firing of our &s;mall Shot from the Trenches, that they hung up a Flag and begg'd for a Par|ley, the be&s;iegers having made 4 Breaches in their Wall, the General being inclinable to pre&s;erve the Prote&s;tants in the Town, did hearken to a &s;econd Treaty; the Conditions were, that the be&s;ieged &s;hould March out with their Arms, and to March no further in a day than the Convoy appointed for them plea&s;ed; the General had not made any Conditions with them, had it not been on the account of the Prote&s;tants in the Town, he being affronted on the fir&s;t Parley; for when the Enemy had mounted &s;ome Guns on their Walls, and put other things into order, which could not po&s;&s;ibly be done without a forbearance of firing from the Trenches, they barbarou&s;ly fired a warning Piece, and took down their Flag, and began to fire furiou&s;ly after the General, and &s;ome Officers before they could get fairly off; however his Grace was plea&s;ed to perfect Articles with the be&s;ieged, and the next day they Marcht out about 400, there being &s;everal killed in the Town, but the Country People who were before plundered by them, came down and took what they &s;aw was their own, &s;o that in two or three miles March, the Enemy lo&s;t mo&s;t of their Baggage; the General was much of|fended at this u&s;age to the be&s;ieged, but it was a thing altogether im|po&s;&s;ible to be prevented, the Rable falling &s;o numerou&s;ly upon them, and taking their own goods where ever they found them; for &s;even days the Army lay again&s;t the Town con&s;tantly firing, and 2 Frigots lying before the Ca&s;tle firing Broad-&s;ide after Broad-&s;ide &s;o mighty &s;harply that there was a continued light clear round the Town the whol, Night, and to do the be&s;ieged right, they behaved them&s;elves verey brave as any Men could do. When the Town and Ca&s;tle were actually in our hands, we found &s;everal hundred Barrels of Beef, Pork, Pea&s;e, Wheat, Malt, and Oatmeal in the Stores, but very little Ammunition. As we Marcht again&s;t the Town of <HI>Carrickfergus,</HI> the General received Advice that 16 Troops of the <HI>Iniskilling</HI> Hor&s;e, and 2 Troops of Dragoons were on their March to join us by Major General <HI>Kirk</HI>'s Orders, which they accordingly did, and at that time they were acceptable enough, there being no Hor&s;e landed out of <HI>England;</HI> the next day Collonel <HI>Coy</HI>'s Regiment of Hor&s;e, Collonel <HI>Levi&s;on</HI>'s Regiment of Dragoons, and &s;everal Regiments of Foot, landed at the <HI>White-hou&s;e</HI> near <HI>Carrickfergus,</HI> and upon our March from the Siege, the Lord <HI>Delamare</HI>'s, and Lord <HI>Devon&s;hire</HI>'s Regiments of Hor&s;e, and Sir <HI>Tho. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">owre</HI>'s Regiment of Foot joined us, &s;o that we intirely Marcht to <HI>Belfa&s;t,</HI> &s;ave Sir <HI>Hen. Ingoldsby</HI>'s Regiment of Foot left in Gari&s;on at <HI>Carrickfergus,</HI> Major General <HI>Kirk</HI> remaining with his and &s;ome of <HI>London-Derry</HI> Forces at <HI>Coleraine.</HI> On the 3d. of <HI>Sept.</HI> we Marcht to <HI>Lisburn,</HI> having &s;ent mo&s;t of our heavy Luggage and Guns by Sea, in order to meet us at <HI>Dundalk</HI> or <HI>Drogheda;</HI> and now there being about 800 of the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> in the <HI>Glens</HI> near <HI>Glenarme,</HI> in the County of <HI>Antrim,</HI> headed by one <HI>Mac Donnel</HI> Natural&s;on to the Earl of <HI>Antrim,</HI> who very much infe&s;ted that Country. One Captain <HI>Stewart</HI> was ordered to detach a certain number out of Sir <HI>H. Ingoldsby</HI>'s Regi|ment, to &s;uppre&s;s the&s;e Rebels, which was accordingly done, and a con|&s;iderable prey of Cattle got from them.</P>
<P>On <HI>September</HI> the 4th, we encamped at <HI>Dromore,</HI> being &s;even Miles from <HI>Lisburn,</HI> and received an account that Major General <HI>Mackay</HI> was landed at <HI>Belfa&s;t,</HI> with &s;ome Hor&s;e and Dragoons; but this proved a mi&s;take: On the 5th we encamped at <HI>Loghbracklan,</HI> and the Enemy being then at <HI>Newry,</HI> in a con&s;iderable Body, commanded by the Duke of <HI>Berwick;</HI> the <HI>Iniskilling</HI> Hor&s;e were ordered for the advance Guards, who di&s;covering a great Body of Hor&s;e, thought fit to retreat, believing the Enemy might have pur&s;ued, and &s;o followed them into our Camp, which was in a readine&s;s to receive them; but the Enemy imagining &s;ome &s;uch thing, did not at all pur&s;ue them, but thought to keep the Pa&s;s at the <HI>Newry.</HI> On our March two Drums belonging to the Lord <HI>King|&s;ton</HI>'s Regiment were hanged near <HI>Dromore,</HI> having revolted and got in|to <HI>Carickfergus</HI> at the time of the Siege. On the 6th, we encamped at <HI>Newry,</HI> the Enemy having de&s;erted that Pa&s;s, and burnt the Town, with all the Inhabitants Goods, and flinging a piece of Cannon into the River, and moved to <HI>Dundalk,</HI> 8 Miles from <HI>Newry,</HI> the <HI>Iniskilling</HI> Hor&s;e (the Duke's <HI>Tartars,</HI> for &s;o they were termed,) &s;till keeping the advance Guard, who marched &s;o near the Town of <HI>Dundalk,</HI> that they took a prey of 150 Cows from the Enemy's Quarters in their view, with &s;ome Sheep, and great quantities of Oatmeal and Butter. We continued our Camp at the <HI>Newry</HI> till the 8th, and the General having advice that the Enemy were marched from <HI>Dundalk,</HI> only leaving &s;ome few Troops there for a Rear-guard, ordered the <HI>Iniskilling</HI> Forces to march forward, and detached 50 Foot out of each Regiment, and 20 out of a Troop, to follow the <HI>Iniskilling</HI> Forces towards <HI>Dundalk,</HI> having before &s;ent a Trumpet to tell them, that if they burned the Town, or de&s;troyed any more Towns on their retreat, or de&s;troy'd the Prote|&s;tants Goods, he would not extend mercy to any that &s;hould happen in his power, and that Major General <HI>Macarty,</HI> then Pri&s;oner at <HI>Iniskil|ling,</HI> &s;hould be executed; this &s;o terrified them that they march'd a|way without firing the Town of <HI>Dundalk,</HI> or doing any great harm to the Prote&s;tants there; and at 8 of the Clock at Night we entered the Town with the&s;e Detachments, and found there great &s;tores of Wheat and other Grain, and Salt, laid up in &s;tores for the Iri&s;h Army; when the whole Body of the Army had moved up, we encamped at <HI>Dundalk,</HI> the one part of the Army on the <HI>Newry</HI> &s;ide of the River, and the Dutch Regiments, with the <HI>Iniskilling</HI> Forces on <HI>Dundalk</HI> &s;ide, and in &s;ome few days after had marched forward, but that our Cannon and Provi&s;ions did not come by Sea &s;o &s;oon as was expected, nor were there draught-hor&s;es for our March in ca&s;e both Ammunition, Guns, and Provi&s;ion had come by the time expected; which was the chief cau&s;e of the Army not moving upwards towards <HI>Dublin,</HI> Comi&s;&s;ary <HI>Shales</HI> not &s;ending the Hor&s;es over in due time: Upon our coming to <HI>Dundalk</HI> the Army plentifully fed on the Lord of <HI>Duleek</HI>'s Mutton, he having fled, and in command with the Rebels: Upon our approach to <HI>Dundalk,</HI> the Enemy likewi&s;e de&s;erted <HI>Atherdee</HI> being 8 Miles from <HI>Drogheda,</HI> and &s;ome of the Engli&s;h Forces advanced &s;o far, and then the late King <HI>James</HI> de&s;igned to rendezvouze his Forces, and encamp on the other &s;ide of the River of <HI>Boyn</HI> beyond <HI>Drogheda;</HI> but finding the En|gli&s;h Army did not move forward, &s;ent a Body of Hor&s;e and &s;ome Foot to <HI>Atherdee,</HI> and &s;ecured that Town, bani&s;hing the Prote&s;tants and ta|king their Sub&s;tance; between which place and <HI>Dundalk</HI> there was &s;ome &s;mall skirmi&s;hing, and particularly at <HI>Mapestown-bridge</HI> our Scou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">s met &s;ome of the Enemy, killed about 9, and took &s;ome Pri&s;oners; in which action one of the <HI>Iniskilling</HI> Hor&s;e and an Engli&s;h Dragoon fell by an Ambu&s;cado. On the 15th, the Enemy's Van guard, con&s;i&s;ting of 4000 Hor&s;e were &s;een to advance within 4 or 5 Miles of our Cam<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter"> and
<PB REF="2" MS="y">the General not having Hor&s;e enough to engage them, ordered &s;ome Trenches to be ca&s;t up a &s;mall way beyond the Town of <HI>Dundalk,</HI> be|tween us and the Enemy, where the two Dutch Regiments were con|&s;tantly encamped, and 2 Regiments mounted the Trenches every day, and ordered 8 pieces of Cannon to be planted upon the Works. On the 16th Major General <HI>Scragmore</HI> embarked for <HI>England;</HI> and on the 17th, Mr. <HI>Hol&s;ort,</HI> the General's Secretary, died at <HI>Dundalk:</HI> On the 18th, 100 Men out of each Regiment were detached to bring the Forage be|tween the Enemy and us: On the &s;ame day 24 Companies of Foot and 4 Troops of the <HI>Iniskilling</HI> Forces joyned us in the Camp, and brought 600 Cows with them, leaving one Regiment of Foot, and &s;ome Troops of Hor&s;e at <HI>Iniskilling.</HI> About this time Collonel <HI>Gu&s;tavus Hamilton</HI>'s Re|giment of Foot, Collonel <HI>Lang&s;ton</HI>'s Hor&s;e, and part of Collonel <HI>Villers</HI>'s Regiment of Hor&s;e, landed at <HI>Belfa&s;t,</HI> which Hor&s;e were daily expected in the Camp; but Collonel <HI>Hamilton</HI>'s Foot were ordered to <HI>Carickfer|gus,</HI> and Sir <HI>Hen. Ingoldsby</HI>'s to march to the Camp. In this time the Enemy daily encrea&s;ed, and came downwards in great Bodies; and on the 19th, the Iri&s;h Scouts appeared within a Mile of the Town of <HI>Dun|dalk,</HI> with whom out Out-guards had a &s;mart Di&s;pute, in which &s;ome fell on both &s;ides. On the 20th, two Gentlemen came from the Iri&s;h Army, and gave the General an account that the Iri&s;h were very nu|merous, but many of them Rabble, and that &s;everal Prote&s;tants had great de&s;ire to come off if they could doe it with &s;afety; and that the Late King <HI>James</HI> was in per&s;on at the head of them, and were encam|ped at <HI>Lurgan Race,</HI> 3 Miles from <HI>Dundalk.</HI> On the 21&s;t, about 7 of the Clock in the Morning &s;everal of the Enemy's Troops were &s;een ad|vancing near our Camp, and about 10 the whole Body of Hor&s;e, con|&s;i&s;ting of 10000, drew up into 5 divi&s;ions within half a Mile of our Trenches, their whole Body of Foot being about 35000 were in the Rear of the Hor&s;e; which account the General had from a De&s;erter, who farther &s;aid, that although they appeared in &s;o great numbers, yet they had not above 4 or 5000 good Hor&s;e, the re&s;t being ill mounted, and wor&s;e armed, &s;everal of their Hor&s;e being Lanciers for want of other Arms, and the greate&s;t part of the Foot a perfect Rabble, and fit|ter for plunder than doing &s;ervice: Some of the Enemy's Hor&s;e advan|ced within Musket Shot of our Trenches, but were forced to retreat, being warmly received by &s;ome Granadeers at the Bog &s;ide, between our Camp and the Enemy's Body, and thereupon the General ordered a good guard of Hor&s;e to march towards them, but the Bog being be|tween, no action happened: His Grace likewi&s;e ordered 300 of the <HI>Iniskilling</HI> Foot, commanded by Collonel <HI>Tiffin,</HI> to march down to the Bog &s;ide, the Enemy having drawn down a Body of Foot to the other &s;ide of the Bog, and lined all the Hedges and Ditches thereabouts; &s;e|veral firings were on both &s;ides, but being at too great a di&s;tance, no great harm was done; and &s;o brave was the <HI>Iniskilling</HI> Foot, that they pa&s;&s;ionately de&s;ired to march over the Bog, and in order to it, every Man of them &s;tript off his Coat, &s;o that in&s;tead of a grey Regiment they appeared in white, being their u&s;ual way in fighting to enable them for better action in the &s;ervice; the General with a &s;trong Guard rid round the Bog, and po&s;ted Men at all places where he apprehended danger; in this manner both Armies &s;tood in readine&s;s, but no En|gagement, and after the late King <HI>James</HI> with his whole Army, had re|mained &s;o for 4 or 5 hours, he marched back to his Camp. On the 23d, 6 Men were taken, one whereof being an experienced Soldier, but a private Centinel, had drawn a Scheme of our Camp, where we lay open, how the Enemy might have fallen in upon us, how our Men &s;ickned, what number of Hor&s;e and Foot we were, and how victualled, and was going over to the Late King, but he and the other 5 were taken, and this Scheme found upon him; &s;o that they were all hanged, and 150 more of the French who were &s;u&s;pected, &s;ent Pri&s;o|ners to <HI>Che&s;ter.</HI> It is believed that the Late King had &s;ome a&s;&s;urance of the French Regiments de&s;erting, if both Armies had then engaged. On the 25th, we had advice from <HI>Sligo,</HI> that Collonel <HI>Lloyd,</HI> with 5 Compa|nies of Foot, and 4 Troops of Hor&s;e and Dragroons, had engaged the Enemy at <HI>Abbyboyle,</HI> and killed 300 in the Church, and in the pur&s;uit took Collonel <HI>Kelly,</HI> Collonel <HI>Dillon,</HI> and Collonel <HI>Farrel,</HI> and killed 300 more, having the pur&s;uit of them for about 11 or 12 Miles, and had their Hor&s;e been fir&s;t, might have cut off the whole Body, being 5000; in which action but 6 of the Prote&s;tants were killed, and 5 wounded; for joy of which great Conque&s;t, there was a running Fire through the Camp, and the Guns in the Fleet returned the &s;ame.</P>
<P>On the 6th of <HI>Octob.</HI> the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Army decamped and Marcht towards <HI>Drogheda,</HI> having fir&s;t burned the whole Country about them, &s;etting all their Huts on fire before they marcht away: Salt, Tobacco, and Brandy were very &s;carce among them, and more e&s;pecially Salt, for that the Soldiers were forced to boil their Meat in Salt Water, little or no Silver was current among&s;t them, but all Copper. On the 6th. the General had an account how Collonel <HI>Lloyd</HI> had taken <HI>James</HI> Town and <HI>Carugdrumroosk</HI> from the Enemy; on the 8th. 150 Hor&s;e Granadeers, 150 Dragroons, and 150 <HI>Inskilling</HI> Hor&s;e were detacht to March to <HI>Sligo,</HI> commanded by Collonel <HI>Ru&s;&s;el</HI> and Collonel <HI>Tiffin:</HI> At their coming to <HI>Sligo</HI> the Enemy were prepared for them, and a &s;mart Engagement happened; but at length about 80 of the Granadeers po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed them|&s;elves of the Fort, and very well defended the &s;ame for &s;ome days a|gain&s;t Collonel <HI>Sarsfield</HI> and his Forces; but being &s;traightened for Pro|vi&s;ion, were forced to capitulate and made honourable Conditions, which were performed by Collonel <HI>Sarsfield,</HI> yet he endeavoured by all fair means to bring the&s;e Men over to King <HI>James</HI> upon promi&s;es of Preferments, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> but they utterly refu&s;ed him. When the late King had decamed, his Grace the Duke of <HI>Schonberg</HI> ordered the greate&s;t part of the Army to Winter Quarters, making <HI>Lisburn</HI> his own head Quarters; but there being &s;ome Shipping in the River of <HI>Dundalk,</HI> which could not &s;ail for want of a Wind, Collonel <HI>L. Moleniere</HI> was left Govern|our at <HI>Dundalk,</HI> with 4 Regiments of Foot, and &s;ome Hor&s;e, to pre&s;erve the&s;e Shipping from the Enemy until they could get out, and then the 4 Regiments marcht intirely from <HI>Dundalk</HI> to Winter Quarters; Sir <HI>H. Ingoldsby</HI>'s Regiment being left at the <HI>Newry</HI> the frontier Gari&s;on. As &s;oon as the Prote&s;tant Forces had Marcht from <HI>Dundalk,</HI> the Enemy po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed them&s;elves of that place, and mo&s;t of the Creates, or poor Country People, droven up by the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Army, returned to that Coun|try, and remained upon the Mountains between <HI>Dundalk</HI> and the <HI>New|ry,</HI> &s;everal of them endeavouring to bring what &s;mall &s;tock of Cattle they had into the County of <HI>Down;</HI> &s;uch as brought any goods with them were admitted to go into the Counties of <HI>Down</HI> and <HI>Antrim,</HI> but &s;uch as brought nothing, were &s;ent back to the Mountains again, and not per|mitted to go into our Country. Sir <HI>Hen. Ingoldsby</HI>'s Regiment being at the <HI>Newry,</HI> commanded by Leiutenant Collonel <HI>Purcel,</HI> Governour of that place, remained peaceably there till about the 5th. or 6th. of <HI>De|cember,</HI> at which time the Governour had an Account of a con&s;iderable Body, both Hor&s;e and Foot, of the Enemy were marching towards <HI>Dundalk,</HI> and intended to attack the Gari&s;on at <HI>Newry,</HI> being the Key of the <HI>North;</HI> whereupon 60 Men and a Captain were pa&s;&s;ed at Narrow Water, 12 with a Serjeant at <HI>Fatham</HI> Ca&s;tle, being a pa&s;s on the River, which was fordable when the Tide was out; and likewi&s;e a con&s;ide|rable number of Men were at Pointz pa&s;s, and the&s;e being the only dangerous Pa&s;&s;es and thus fortified, Collonel <HI>Purcel</HI> thought him&s;elf &s;e|cure as to the Pa&s;s at the <HI>Newry;</HI> but about the 8th. or 9th of <HI>December</HI> 1700 Foot, and 6 Troops of Hor&s;e and Dragoons, came within a quarter of a mile of <HI>Newry,</HI> out of which 300 were detacht and &s;ent into the Town by break of day, having killed our out Guards: Upon which the Gari&s;on received the Allarm, yet &s;o very quick was the Enemy, that they were in the Town before the main Guard could draw out, there not being above 40 effectual Men, who behaved them&s;elves &s;o well, that they forced that part of the Enemy marching up from the Bridge to retreat, but &s;ome of the Enemy getting &s;ooner into the Town, and having notice where the Officers quartered, killed Captain <HI>Whitfield</HI> going out of his Quarters, and killed Captain <HI>Miller</HI> in the &s;treet; Leiutenant <HI>Shrould</HI> received a wound on the thigh, whereof he died, and 4 of the Soldiers killed. There was killed of the Enemy a Lieu|tenant Collonel, with 14 Men in the Town, be&s;ides &s;everal taken off dead, and many wounded, of which the Governour had a certain ac|count afterwards: The main Body finding the forlorn thus defeated, marcht back to <HI>Dundalk,</HI> and altho' they have often re&s;olved to attack the Gari&s;on again, have never yet attempted it; and &s;ince they could not come into the <HI>North</HI> of <HI>Ireland</HI> at the Pa&s;&s;es of Naview Water, fathom Ca&s;tle, Newry or Pointz his Pa&s;s, they intended to attack the Gari&s;on at <HI>Belturbet</HI> in the County of <HI>Cavan,</HI> then and now under the command of Collonel <HI>Wol&s;ely,</HI> Collonel of a Regiment of the <HI>Iniskilling</HI> Hor&s;e, and think to get into the <HI>North</HI> that way; but Collonel <HI>Wol&s;ely</HI> having an ac|count of their de&s;ign re&s;olved to prevent them, and on the 12th. of <HI>March</HI> with 700 Foot and 300 Hor&s;e marcht towards <HI>Cavan,</HI> where 2000 of the Enemy were; his purpo&s;e was to fall upon them by break of day, ha|ving but 7 Miles to March from <HI>Belturbet</HI> to <HI>Cavan;</HI> but the Enemy ha|ving po&s;ted &s;ome &s;mall number of Men at a place called <HI>Butlers</HI>-Bridge, the Collonel could not pa&s;s there without allarming them, which would very &s;oon after be at <HI>Cavan,</HI> therefore it was agreed to March peaceably up the River-&s;ide, to afoord at a place called <HI>Bullynacarrig</HI> being 4 Miles out of the way, when the Collonel had advanced as far as this place, the Enemy had likewi&s;e &s;ome Men po&s;ted there, who gave notice to them of <HI>Cavan,</HI> the Collonel notwith&s;tanding marcht all his Men over the Biver, and &s;oon after day-light was within half a mile of <HI>Cavan</HI> on <HI>Dub|lin</HI> &s;ide of the Town, but in&s;tead of &s;urprizing them, he found their Gari&s;on re-inforced by 2000, and the whole Body fairly formed into a defen&s;ive po&s;ture, and ready to receive him, commanded by the Duke of <HI>Berwick;</HI> this much &s;urprized him, and to retreat would certainly ruin the whole bu&s;ine&s;s, therefore the Collonel detached 150, and po|&s;ted them at a convenient pa&s;s for a re&s;erve, and with the remainder charged the Enemy; the <HI>Iniskilling</HI> Dragoons made the fir&s;t on-&s;et, but were forced to lo&s;e ground, upon this the Collonel commanded &s;ome <HI>Dutch</HI> Granadeers to march up, who behaved them&s;elves &s;o well, that the Enemy lo&s;t ground; by which means the <HI>Iniskilling</HI> Dragoons rallied and joined the body again, and then for an hour the matter was horly di&s;|puted, and at length the Enemy took to flight, one part of them made to the Fort, and the other towards <HI>Finah.</HI> In the pur&s;uit were killed 139 be&s;ides &s;everal Officers, Collonel, <HI>Edmond O Reily,</HI> with &s;ome other Officers of great Note was killed in the fir&s;t Engagement; on our &s;ide we lo&s;t 4 Captains and 20 Men. When this action was over, the <HI>Ini|skilling</HI> Men began to plunder the Town, and were &s;tragling in odd numbers about the place, which the Enemy di&s;covering from the Fort, drew out a fre&s;h party, and came down upon them; but the re&s;erve as I mentioned before, being in order and a readine&s;s engaged them, and forced them into the Fort again, and then Collonel <HI>Wol&s;ley</HI> ordered the Town to be burned, and likewi&s;e burned <HI>Killi&s;handrew</HI> on his March to <HI>Belturbet;</HI> in &s;ome few days after, a party of Hor&s;e fell on &s;ome of the Enemy, who were intrencht at <HI>Butlers</HI>-Bridge, killing about 36 and taking &s;everal Pri&s;oners, with the chief Officers commanding there, in which &s;econd action not a man of the Prote&s;tants were lo&s;t. As for the Gari&s;on of <HI>Charlemont,</HI> they are in a manner blockt up, for &s;ince Collonel <HI>Withers</HI> burned the Bridge, and took their Boats, they cannot make any incur&s;ions into the Country, we having Gari&s;ons at <HI>Dungannon, Armagh, Benburl,</HI> and <HI>Loghgall;</HI> the General took a view of the place and makes no doubt of having it before the Army take the Field, yet the Enemy have not been idle in fortifying this place, for they have flung up a Ditch on the out-&s;ide of the Trench, equally high with the Wall, &s;o that although the Ca&s;tle be of it &s;elf weak, yet the Fortifi|cations about it are &s;trong. The Prince of <HI>Wirtemberg</HI> is arrived with the <HI>Dani&s;h</HI> Forces at <HI>Carickfergus,</HI> whither his Grace the Duke of <HI>Schon|berg</HI> is ju&s;t now a going to &s;ee them, the <HI>Mary</HI> Yatcht has brought to <HI>Belfa&s;t</HI> a Boat that was going with eight Pa&s;&s;engers from <HI>Scotland</HI> to <HI>Dub|lin.</HI> The Army is now in a very good Condition, both as to Health, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and well provided with Provi&s;ins, and are mo&s;t impatient for the Sea&s;on of the Year in taking the Field.</P>
