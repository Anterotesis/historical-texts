<P>I have for &s;ome time much de&s;ired not only to &s;ee you, but al&s;o to have &s;ome conference with you. And having now &s;o happily met, I de&s;ire (if your occa&s;ions will permit) that at this time my de&s;ires may be accompli&s;hed herein.</P>

<P>Sir, The &s;ubject of the Di&s;cour&s;e which I de&s;ire may be in&s;i&s;ted on, relates to the De&s;igne now on foot again&s;t the Span|jards in the <HI>West Indies,</HI> which is now indeed the di&s;cour&s;e of the Nation.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sea.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Sir, As to that, I have much cau&s;e to be|lieve you are &s;atisfied in your &s;elf in all particu|lars; and the rather, becau&s;e you are daylie conver&s;ant with tho&s;e that principally carries on the bu&s;ine&s;s; who&s;e Principl's you are &s;o well acquainted with, that their very owning the bu|&s;ine&s;s is &s;atisfactory.</HI></P>

<P><HI>Sir, I do in the&s;e particulars de&s;ire to be excu&s;ed, being not &s;o endowed with tho&s;e facul|ties of per&s;wa&s;ive arguments as ene ought to be fitted with, that takes upon him to re&s;olve the doubts of another.</HI></P>

<SPEAKER>Sea.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Sir, I &s;hall crave one favour of you (be|fore I &s;ay any thing by way of an&s;wer) the which if you plea&s;e to grant me, it will produce at lea&s;t my thankfulne&s;s, and peradventure &s;ome part of &s;atisfaction to you as to the matter in hand.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sold.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, I &s;hall very freely comply with your de&s;ire, if it lie in my power; and there|fore what you defire to &s;ay, plea&s;e to be very free in it, for be what it will, it &s;hall give me no offence.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sea.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Sir, Your curte&s;ie obliges me in bonds of thankfulne&s;s, and emboldens me to proceed to put this que&s;tion to you, in regard you have been deeply engaged in the late wars of this Nation. I pray Sir, from whence did the lawfulne&s;s of that war proceed, and what did the lawfulne&s;s there|of con&s;i&s;t of principally?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sold</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, The lawfulne&s;s of that war con|&s;i&s;ted of divers particulars. Thus, <HI>viz.</HI> the Lord was plea&s;ed to cau&s;e &s;piritual light to break forth in the mid&s;t of darkne&s;s, and the Sun of Righteou&s;ne&s;s began to appear above our Horizon, and to have its reflection upon the Sons and Daughters of the mo&s;t high God, who &s;pake forth as they were taught by the
<PB N="4" REF="4">Spirit, and began to publi&s;h the glad tydings of the Go&s;pel; this morning of our re&s;urre|ction from our former condition of blindne&s;s and darkne&s;s, began to be clouded, and the Clergie begun to heighten their per&s;ecution, and to impri&s;on and &s;tigmatize the me&s;&s;en|gers of Chri&s;t, and by all po&s;&s;ible means en|deavour'd to put out the candle of the Go&s;pel among&s;t us, and to light the &s;tinking &s;nuffs of Popery, and to enflame us both in things re|lating to the inward and outward man; la|bouring with all the power and might they could, to deprive us of that glorious light then breaking forth among&s;t us; and blotting out tho&s;e precious truths of Chri&s;t which many &s;ouls have in former ages &s;ealed to with their blood, endeavouring to de&s;troy our precious &s;ouls, by betraying us into the hands of tho&s;e murderers and ma&s;&s;acrers of the Lords peo|ple, <HI>i. e.</HI> the Papal faction; who&s;e malicious out|rage again&s;t us, this, (as al&s;o former ages) have had large experience of. Now &s;eeing the life of our precious &s;ouls, and the lives and liber|ties of our Birth-rights are at the &s;take, and fire and fagot in abundance, ready to con&s;ume all. The Lord giving us hearts and hands (with an opportunity) to appear in our own de|fence. We have &s;o done, and in the &s;trength
<PB N="5" REF="4">of the Lord, have al&s;o prevailed as at this day.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sea.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Sir, I hope you under&s;tand me thus,</HI> viz. <HI>that at fir&s;t, I que&s;tioned not the lawfulne&s;s of that War, but onely de&s;ired the grounds of it, which you have effectually given me.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sol.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, I ob&s;erve you put the que&s;tion to me; not whether the &s;aid War was law|ful or no: but rather where its lawfulne&s;s did con&s;i&s;t.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sea.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Sir, I did &s;o, and you have &s;o cleerly &s;atisfied me, that I apprehend the glory of Chri&s;t, and advancement of his Kingdome, the propa|gating of the Go&s;pel, the liberty of the Saints, and al&s;o National priviledges, which were all ready to be di&s;troyed, were the only grounds of your Ingagements: and &s;uch infallible grounds as the Lord hath crowned with &s;uch event, as his peoples Chri&s;tian Priviledges are pre&s;erved, and the Go&s;pel hath free pa&s;&s;age; which is a mercy we have now &s;o long enjoyed that (I fear) it is not prized to its worth.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sold.</SPEAKER>
<P>We have all cau&s;e to bewail our in|gratitude on that account.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sea.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Sir, Now I &s;hall come to give you my thoughts and my rea&s;ons for them thus: Is the advancement of the Kingdom of Chri&s;t a thing &s;o con&s;iderable, as to move one Engli&s;hman to
<PB N="6" REF="5">&s;heath his Sword in the Bowels of another: nay, in the bowels of a brother? Is the enjoyment of this glorious Liberty, &s;o &s;weet, &s;o excellent, that life it &s;elf is nothing in compari&s;on of it? Are tho&s;e &s;oul-ravi&s;hing loves of Chri&s;t, &s;o e&s;teemable, &s;o excellent, &s;o &s;weet &s;o glorious, that they will make a</HI> Paul <HI>and</HI> Silas <HI>&s;ing in a pri&s;on, Mar|tyrs rejoyce in burning flames? Is this light glorious, and the blackne&s;s of darkne&s;s, terri|ble? &s;ure the&s;e things are &s;o; yea they are &s;o ex|cellently glorious, that we by and in the enjoy|ment of them, &s;tand engaged in the highe&s;t Na|ture, to be friends to Chri&s;ts friends, and ene|mies to his enemies, to the utmo&s;t of our powers, not omitting any opportunity, by which the pow|ers of Antichri&s;t may be weakened The Lord hath &s;trengthened us in the appearings of our &s;elves in our own behalves, and doubtle&s;s will appear yet for us, if in &s;incerity of heart, we do lay out our &s;elves for, and on the behalf of Chri&s;t and his People, who yet are under the Egyptian Yoke of Bondage, from under which the Lord hath delivered us.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sol.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, this you have &s;aid is truth, and is a very &s;uitable Introduction, to what I &s;up|po&s;e you have yet to &s;ay, as to this di&s;cour&s;e now depending: therefore I pray pro|ceed.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="7" REF="5">
<SPEAKER>Sea.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Sir, I &s;hall now proceed to give you the particulars of my judgement, as to the que&s;tion you have propounded; And fir&s;t thus. 'Tie clear to me that the late War (in this Nation) was not an accidental War (as &s;ome &s;eem to judge it:) But the ab&s;olute appearances of God (by his &s;pirit in his People) again&s;t the powers of the world, which are Antichri&s;tian. Now if it be lawful for the &s;pirit to war again&s;t the fle&s;h (which is granted of all) then it mu&s;t be &s;o in the general, as wel berwixt people of &s;everal Nations, as betwixt the people of one Nation, one again&s;t another.</HI></P>
<P><HI>So that if it be lawful for the spirit in a man to war again&s;t the fle&s;h of that man, and the people of a Nation to war again&s;t the people of the &s;ame Nation; being of an Antichri&s;ti|an &s;pirit (as is already granted) and Scripture it &s;elf bears te&s;timony to it.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Then undoubtedly for us, a people in cove|nant with the Lord, it mu&s;t needs be lawful for us, nay a duty incumbent upon us, to mani|fe&s;t our &s;elves enemies to the publique and pro|fe&s;t enemies of the Lord and his people.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sol</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir as to the&s;e particulars of the con|&s;tant warfare of the &s;pirit again&s;t the fle&s;h: and it again&s;t the &s;pirit, and the lawfulne&s;s thereof, they are things generally received
<PB N="8" REF="6">among&s;t, and believed of all that have any appearings or breathings of God in them, and therefore we judge what you have &s;aid, granted of all.</P>
<P>And do de&s;ire you will proceed to more particular application of your di&s;cour&s;e to the cleering up of the lawfulne&s;s of the pre|&s;ent War with <HI>Spain,</HI> &s;o as it is now begun.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sea.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Sir, 'Tis granted, that the Lord hath wonderfully appeared in</HI> England, <HI>and for</HI> Eng|land, <HI>having brought us out of darkne&s;s into light, and from the power of Satan unto God; having brought down the Mighty from their Seats, and exalted whom he plea&s;ed.</HI></P>
<P><HI>And truly it is very clear from Scripture, that this work begun in this Nation, &s;hall go forth from Nation to Nation, till all the Nati|ons of the Earth have ta&s;ted of this Cup,</HI> Jer. 25. <HI>Now the conte&s;t is, light &s;wallowing up of dark|ne&s;s. The &s;pirit and power of Chri&s;t overturn|ing and de&s;troying the &s;pirit and powers of An|tichri&s;t; which work being now begun, &s;hall (though &s;eemingly at a &s;tand) how ever not de|&s;i&s;t till the de&s;ign of Chri&s;t is accompli&s;hed, and his Name and his Glory one in all Lands.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sol.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, your di&s;cour&s;e relates to a &s;piri|tual work, which the Lord hath to carry on in the &s;ouls of the &s;ons of men, mi&s;tically by
<PB N="9" REF="6">his &s;pirit, which we generally apprehend not to be a work of the &s;word, but of the &s;pirit and word preached, for we do not under|&s;tand the Kingdome of Chri&s;t any other then his Indwelling pre&s;ence in the &s;oul of man, with its gifts and graces, which are the fruits thereof.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sea.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Sir, we &s;hall leave this di&s;cour&s;e you hint at: as not bring that &s;ubject in hand: And fearing time will out-&s;trip me, I &s;hall one|ly de&s;ire you to read and meditate (at your be&s;t lei&s;ure) the&s;e en&s;uing Scriptures,</HI> Jer. 25.15, 16, to the 34. I&s;ai. 66.15.16. I&s;ai. 63.6, 7. I&s;ai. 14.21. to 28. Jer. 23.19, 20, &amp;c.</P>
<P><HI>Whil&s;t we proceed to a clo&s;e of my An&s;wer to your que&s;tion, which I &s;hall infer from your own words thus,</HI> viz.</P>
<P><HI>You have granted that your fir&s;t ground of ingagement in</HI> England, <HI>was for and on the be|half of Chri&s;t and the Go&s;pel; To throw down Antichri&s;t and his Adherents and (in&s;trumon|tally) to make way for the free pa&s;&s;age of the Go&s;pel in this Nation, which through mercy is attained to in a large mea&s;ure.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Now I &s;hall with all humility, u&s;e the words of our Saviour to</HI> Peter. When thou art con|verted &s;trengthen thy Brethren: Peters <HI>con|ver&s;ion was not onely for him&s;elf. Now is
<PB N="10" REF="7">Englands Conver&s;ion and Inlargement only for its &s;elf?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Hath Chri&s;t appeared (as we &s;aid at fir&s;t) in</HI> England, <HI>by the Word, Spirit and Sword, and will he not yet appear for, and with</HI> England, <HI>if they engage for and on his behalf, again&s;t the powers of darkne&s;s, now reigning in other Nati|ons?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sol.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir. I pray plea&s;e to come to the life of the di&s;cour&s;e, and clo&s;e your An&s;wer as briefly as conveniencie will permit, for my &s;pirits are on fire to hear more of this, to the purpo&s;e you &s;eem to aym at.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sea.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Sir, you will plea&s;e to remember, it's granted that it's lawful for the people of God to ingage again&s;t the enemies of his glory.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sol.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, that was granted at the fir&s;t, but how this will lead us to the breach of peace, with a neighbour Nation, I long to have cleered.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sea.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Sir, I &s;hall proceed thus, bearing &s;till in mind what is granted me,</HI> viz. <HI>The grounds of Englands <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="faint" EXTENT="1+ letters">r&s;t War, and what hath bin hint|ed as to that. Greater enemies to the Lord Je&s;us his truths and people, is not in the world, then the Pople, (that man of &s;in) and his Adhe|rents are, who &s;its in the very Seat of Chri&s;t, and takes upon him the very Office of Chri&s;t;
<PB N="11" REF="7">exalting him&s;elf again&s;t (yea above) all that is called God, or that is wor&s;hipped; i&s;&s;uing forth indulgencies, for any manner of fact committed again&s;t the Laws of Chri&s;t upon his own terms, and for his own private and &s;ini&s;ter ends, forbid|ding the u&s;e of Scripture, and valuing the mi&s;te|ries of God with Je&s;uitical fomentations, and fal&s;e Doctrines of Livels, by which means thou|&s;ands of poor &s;ouls are (&s;piritually) mur|thered, and &s;ent headlong into eternal darkne&s;s, who&s;e blood (with the bloed of Saints) both in their degrees, cries for vengeance to be executed upon their betrayers and murtherers.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sol.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, As to the Pope, 'tis granted, he is that man of &s;in, and &s;on of perdition, which the Lord hath threatened to de&s;troy, and who&s;e utter ruine and de&s;olation ha&s;teneth; but what relation hath this to the lawfulne&s;s of a War with <HI>Spain?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sea.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Sir, If the Pope mu&s;t fall, then the Pil|lars or main Supporters on which his power &s;tandeth mu&s;t be fir&s;t removed: And if &s;o, then</HI> Spain <HI>mu&s;t fir&s;t be aymed at, who is his Right Hand; for he, and he onely,</HI> viz. <HI>the</HI> Spaniard <HI>maintains that bloody Inqui&s;ition, that crim&s;on Gulph, in which thou&s;ands of poor &s;ouls are (on all occa&s;ons) &s;ecretly &s;wallowed up, and &s;ent to their Beds of darkne&s;s: That
<PB N="12" REF="8">cur&s;ed Court upholds the Man of &s;in, forcing men to live in darkne&s;&s;e and ignorance, which they bla&s;phemou&s;ly call the mother of devotion; by who&s;e power and cruelty the people of God li|ving in or neer their Territories, are per&s;ecu|ted, afflicted, and tormented, even as at this day.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sol.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, this being granted, how will it appear that this way we have taken will bee the be&s;t way to bring down the enemies of the Lord, and work the deliverance of his people in captivity under them, &s;eeing the place is far remote?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sea.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Sir, though the place be remote, as to di&s;tance of place, yet its nigh as to the bu&s;ine&s;&s;e depending. The Spaniard we have hinted is the Popes &s;upporter, and the Trea&s;ure of the We&s;t-India's is the Spaniards &s;trength. The&s;e Silver Sinews, and Golden Nerves, are the &s;trength of the Man of &s;in; as to his external part, which to de&s;troy is (in&s;trumentally) the work of the Sword: Cut but in twain that Sil|ver thread, and</HI> Babels <HI>brats will murther one another; &s;top but the current of this Silver &s;tream, and they all die with thir&s;t</HI></P>

<P>Sir, you do much &s;atisfie mee with your di&s;cour&s;e. But I pray illu&s;trate your thoughts in this bu&s;ine&s;s more unto me; you
<PB N="13" REF="8">&s;eem to &s;mother &s;omething which might give me much light in this bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sea.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Sir, I told you at the fir&s;t, that I would not meddle with any per&s;wa&s;ive Arguments to convince others. But onely tell you my own thoughts in this thing.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sol.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, I expect no other but your own thoughts of it, and to that end I apprehend all your di&s;cour&s;e tends; and no other ways; therefore I pray proceed further in this di&s;|cour&s;e.</P>

<SPEAKER>Sea.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Sir, I &s;hall &s;tate</HI> England <HI>(now) in the capacity of</HI> I&s;rael, <HI>upon the Borders of</HI> Ca|naan, <HI>lately brought out of Egyptian Bondage, They are entred the Land, and the Walls of</HI> Je|richo, <HI>are fallen by Faith, they have got foot|ing and what mu&s;t now be done.

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sol.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, I apprehend your di&s;cour&s;e, and what you aim at; but we have not pro&s;per|ed in this thing, 'tis &s;aid the hearts of our men are taken away, and a handfull of the enemy hath put our Army to flight, and di|vers of them to the &s;word, and this cau&s;eth many to think the Lord doth not own the work.</P>

<PB N="14" REF="9">
<SPEAKER>Sea.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Sir, you &s;peak to the purpo&s;e, there are many indeed &s;cruple much at this. But pray let us take notice of the condition we have &s;ta|ted</HI> England <HI>in, and I am of the mind there will much &s;atisfaction flow from it:</HI> England <HI>is &s;ta|ted in the capacity of</HI> I&s;rael, <HI>entred</HI> Canaan, <HI>and</HI> Jericho <HI>is de&s;troyed by Faith, which opened the way,</HI> Jo&s;h. 6.20. <HI>Now the next place</HI> I&s;rael <HI>is to take in, is the City of</HI> Ai: Jo&s;huah <HI>&s;ends Spies to di&s;cover the City, who return, and tell him the people are but few, &s;end up part of the Army to take it, for the Body need not go:</HI> Jo&s;huah <HI>&s;ends, but his men are put to flight be|fore the men of</HI> Ai, <HI>and &s;ome of them are &s;lain: what is the matter now? pray what cour&s;e takes</HI> Jo&s;huah? <HI>doth he cry out the de&s;ign is unlaw|full? No he makes his addre&s;&s;e to the Lord, as a Saint and Souldier indeed. And pray what an&s;wer doth the Lord give him?</HI> viz. <HI>Get thee up, wherefore liest thou thus upon thy face,</HI> I&s;rael <HI>hath &s;inned, they have medled with the accur&s;ed thing: There's the matter.

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sol.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, pray what do you infer from hence, <HI>I&s;rael</HI> was entred the Land of <HI>Cana|an,</HI> and had Commi&s;&s;ion to de&s;troy the In|habitants and to po&s;&s;e&s;&s;e their Land. But

<P><HI>Sir, though it was not in the hand, it is po&s;&s;ible that is might be in the heart of &s;ome, (thats wor&s;e,) The hands if defiled may bee

<P><HI>The de&s;ign is the Lords though carried on by Man. It is therefore of concernment to tho&s;e that are or &s;hall bee imployed in it, to bee &s;ingle hearted.

<P><HI>Sir, I have given you one instance al|ready in the bu&s;ine&s;&s;e of</HI> Achan, <HI>plea&s;e to take another which you &s;hall find recorded in that</HI> 20. <HI>of</HI> Judges, <HI>where</HI> I&s;rael <HI>is twice overcome of the Benjamites.

<P><HI>Be&s;ides if wee call to mind tha late Warres among&s;t our &s;elves, and con&s;ider how oft wee were but in a low condition. And had we then
<PB N="17" REF="10">&s;ate dewn and cried the de&s;ign is unlawfull where had the glorious liberty of the Saints then been? where had Go&s;pel priviledges been which once were prized above life? Plea&s;e to call to mind, the bu&s;ine&s;s of</HI> Dunbar <HI>(in Scotland) what capacity was our Army then in (as to the Arms of fle&s;h) was there not &s;ome cau&s;e for us to fear the de&s;ign was unlawful? The late di&s;pute with the</HI> Dutch, <HI>may be al|mo&s;t worth our minding; how highly was that in&s;ulting enemy elevated? how did he boa&s;t him&s;elf in his own &s;trength; and what if then we had cry'd out the de&s;igne is unlawful, and had de&s;i&s;ted to u&s;e the means: Sure ere this time we had all &s;poke perfect</HI> Dutch.</P>

<P>Sir, You have Coted Scripture, and &s;tated <HI>England</HI> in the capacity of the <HI>I&s;ra|lites:</HI> But it &s;eems to me, our commi&s;&s;ion from that Parrallel'd condition of theirs, with ours, is different, for they were ab&s;olutely commanded to de&s;troy the Inhabitants of the Land of <HI>Canaan;</HI> to the end they might peaceably enjoy that good Land, as God had promi&s;ed: Now &s;o far we have done in our own Dominions and Territories; all is brought under &s;ubjection, either willingly or by con&s;traint:</P>

<P><HI>Plea&s;e to peru&s;e (at your lei&s;ure) that twentieth of</HI> Deuteronomy, <HI>and there you &s;hall find Laws and Rules for</HI> I&s;rael <HI>to ob&s;erve in their War with people that were not of the Cities of tho&s;e Nations,</HI> ver&s;. 25. <HI>for a de&s;ti|tute people, there was a de&s;titute Law, contra|ry to the other:</HI></P>
<P><HI>Which Law warranted</HI> I&s;rael <HI>to war with any Nation or Nations, that were their ene|mies: And undoubtedly will warrant us to wage War with any Nation that is our enemy, which</HI> Spain <HI>is to the utmo&s;t, in intent, though other ways pretended in the Complement.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sol.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, I perceive you are very cleer in this thing, and free in your &s;pirit for the lawfulne&s;s of it; you have al&s;o quoted Scrip|ture, which tends to the purpo&s;e; &s;o that it appears its cleer to you, that the de&s;ign is of God.</P>

<P><HI>Truly Sir, I am no States man, nor

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sea.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Sir, what I &s;hall &s;ay as to this, is on|ly thus much,</HI> viz.</P>
<P><HI>We are a people that call upon the Name of the Lord, and pretend (I hope more) the advance|ment of the Kingdom of Grace; and do, or ought at lea&s;t to indeavour, the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of our di&s;tre&s;&s;ed brethren in other parts, who dwel in the de&s;arts of Egyptian darkne&s;s, though we are in the Land of</HI> Go&s;hen; <HI>We are al&s;o a people, really de&s;pi&s;ed of all this are round about us. The rather becau&s;e we have puld down that Horn of Kingly pride, &s;o much ado|red among&s;t the Nations: There is al&s;o a &s;pi|rit of divi&s;ion crept in among&s;t us; and the Sword mu&s;t keep the Peace, or we &s;hall de&s;troy one another: And it concerns the Eyes of this
<PB N="20" REF="12">Nation to look about them, and their hands to be active for their own defence; for certainly, certainly, evil determined of the Nations: We mu&s;t indeavour to weaken the powers of An|tichri&s;t, or they will de&s;troy us. God hath cho|&s;en us for a people to &s;erve him in &s;pirit and in truth; If we do &s;o, he will own us: If we do become</HI> Laodeceans, <HI>he will &s;pue us out of his mouth: yea a fearful &s;puing will come upon our glory: As to State matters, I leave them to tho&s;e per&s;ons of State, whom they more imme|diately concern, de&s;iring the keeper of</HI> I&s;rael, <HI>may watch over them for good, that the people may call them ble&s;&s;ed.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sol.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, I perceive you are not free to give your judgment as to things that relate to humane policy: I &s;hall gather your mind from what hath been &s;aid; and do de&s;ire (in regard I perceive you have been in the <HI>Indi|aes</HI>) you will give me &s;ome light of the na|ture of it, and how you think it may agree with con&s;titutions that have been con&s;tantly in cold Countries.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sea.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Sir, Experience tells me that Tempe|rance is (next to God) health's pre&s;erver in tho&s;e parts: the Country being very plea&s;ant and de&s;ireable: And the hard&s;hips a Souldier meets withall, there very facil to be born, in regard
<PB N="21" REF="12">of the continual warmth: As to long Marches you need not que&s;tion good Quarters upon your way, the Fouls of divers &s;orts, will make you mu&s;ick all the day, and &s;up you at night; only you mu&s;t be prudent in furni&s;hing your &s;elf with water, upon all occa&s;ions, which you will &s;ind enough of, flowing from betwixt the &s;ilvered Hills; and of all &s;orts of varieties of other pro|vi&s;ions you will not lack: Its not to inhabit a Wilderne&s;s, but rather a Canaan that they go to, that go thither.</HI></P>

<P><HI>Sir, they that tell you &s;o, will do well to deep them out of harms way: I pray tell me wherein the hard&s;hip of &s;ervice con&s;i&s;ts, 'tis pro|bable I may mi&s;take, or may have for got &s;ome few former experiences which once (in part) I have had.</HI></P>

<PB N="22" REF="13">
<SPEAKER>Sol.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, the hard&s;hip of a Souldiers &s;er|vice, is commonly hard fare, long and hard (or fa&s;t) marchings, wet, and cold and thir&s;t, and the like.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sea.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Sir, as to fare, you cannot want it there, if Prudent and Provident to provide on all opportunities. And as to long Marches they may be prevented, there being few or no places much Inland, that we &s;hall fall upon, till wee are better acquainted then now we are.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sol.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, but I have been informed, that mo&s;t of the Spani&s;h inhabited places are very &s;trong to the Sea-ward, and therefore not &s;afe to land Forces in the Front of them, but rather to land at a di&s;tance, and to march upon them, where they are weake&s;t, and that it &s;eems is Land-ward.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sea.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Sir, &V;nder favour, you will find &s;uch Marches as you &s;peak of, attended with &s;ome difficulties, by rea&s;on of the Country its being &s;o Wooddy, they may fall Trees in your way, and &s;top all your Pa&s;&s;es, and after &s;ome dayes march may prevent your enterprize.</HI></P>
<P><HI>What is the matter I pray you, can we not face Frontiers, and look in the mouths of Can|non as well abroad as at home: But grant wee do march, it is but ob&s;erving times, and march|ing moderately; as al&s;o having a care that the
<PB N="23" REF="13">Du&s;t of the Gold get not into our Throats (by vertue of a conceit) and cau&s;e a greater thir&s;t then our proportion of Water will &s;atisfie. As to wet and cold, they are &s;trangers; cold ever, wet for the greate&s;t part; for which provi&s;ion is made.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sol.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, I perceive you are very much for this de&s;ign, and truly you have &s;o &s;atisfied me, that I profe&s;&s;e if I am thereunto called, I &s;hall (in the &s;trength of the Lord) with much freedome of &s;pirit, and cheerfulne&s;&s;e of mind proceed; not doubting but the pre|&s;ence of the Lord will bee with us for out good.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Sea.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Sir, It is indeed very clear to me, up|on very &s;erious Con&s;ideration, that this de&s;ign is of God, and for God, and he will appear in it. However this demur came, it is very un&s;afe to place &s;elf in the Van, when wee go about the work of the Lord, nor to tru&s;t in the Arm of Fle&s;h: I &s;hould not wi&s;h any man to go in com|mand on this de&s;ign, except he is per&s;waded his call is from the Lord; it is good for every man to be per&s;waded in his own heart; much more might be &s;aid, but time will not permit.</HI></P>
