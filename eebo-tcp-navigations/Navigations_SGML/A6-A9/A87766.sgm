<HEAD>THE <HI>KING OF DENMARKS</HI> Navie.</HEAD>
<P>AFter the confu&s;ive di&s;tractions in this King|dome of <HI>England,</HI> intelligence being &s;pread abroad to mo&s;t neighboring Nations, con|cerning his Maje&s;ty mo&s;t particularly, and a|mong&s;t others the King of <HI>Denmarke</HI> hearing of the &s;ame, fir&s;t convocated a Councell, and when he perceived the pronene&s;&s;e, and eager readine&s;&s;e of the <HI>Danes:</HI> who&s;e propen&s;ity was greater then he expected, he forthwith by the unanimous con|&s;ent of his Coun&s;ell, concluded to rai&s;e a Fleet, which he would &s;end over to the Engli&s;h Coa&s;t re&s;pectively. They elected immediatly <HI>Keevalo Dunous</HI> to be their chief Commander, and &s;et for|ward with 75 &s;ayl the 13 of this pre&s;ent month of <HI>March,</HI> but they &s;tayed two dais on &s;hore, ex|pecting a good wind, and &s;o they &s;et forward the 15. day having a good gale, tryumphing in great pomp, &amp;c. There are above 40000. <HI>Danes</HI> in all, and it is &s;uppos'd, that their number will be &s;hort|ly augmented. They lye now at the Coa&s;ts of <HI>Ireland,</HI> and they &s;ent a me&s;&s;age to the King of their loyalty to his Maje&s;ty, and the cau&s;e of their comming and intents were onely to vindicate the
<PB REF="3" MS="y">abu&s;ive injuries done again&s;t his Royall per&s;on: but the King (who&s;e care and vigilancy extends to the pro&s;perous &s;ecurity of his &s;ubiects, who&s;e clemen|cy is adorned with &s;uch patience, that he had rather &s;uffer wrong him&s;elf, then bath the &s;ame in cloudy tevenge to the detriment, and hazard of his King|domes) would not accept of their &s;ervice, and di&s;|creetly denyed their entertainment.</P>
<P>But they continue at the Iri&s;h Coa&s;t &s;till, and if they hear not further an&s;wer from His Maje&s;ty &s;peedily, they will return again into their Country, which God grant they may, as &s;oon as they plea&s;e.</P>

<HEAD>The King of Frances Navie</HEAD>
<P>THe French King hearing of the turbulent divi&s;ions in <HI>Eng<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">and,</HI> and &s;ome abu&s;es done to his Brother, known particularly by the private information of a dear Friend, and moved by the &s;ame to a&s;&s;i&s;t his Maje&s;ty, &s;ummoned a Navie, under the command of Captain <HI>De Sunae Bewit,</HI> and intended to &s;et forward for <HI>England.</HI> The certainty of this News is credible, a though there hath been &s;ome ementitious Pamphlets that have heretofore bin fictitiou&s;ly publi&s;hed, intimating that the French fleet was provided long &s;ince, bvt it was not intended before now of late: and although the o|ther was a lye, would this were &s;o too, but it is too
<PB REF="3">certaine. They have fifty &s;ix &s;aile, and about thir|ty thou&s;and &s;ouldiers, loaded like wi&s;e with great provi&s;ion of Armes.</P>
<P>They lye in the narrow &s;eas, and were di&s;cryed by two <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Merchants &s;hips, who e&s;pied them there, and reported it at <HI>London</HI> for truth.</P>
<P>And noe que&s;tion but they will be at <HI>England</HI> very &s;uddatnely, if they be not timely prevented, for be&s;ides that number, twice as many more are re&s;olved to &s;econd them, and doe now waite in rea|dine&s;&s;e: they come likewi&s;e to maintaine his Ma|je&s;ties cau&s;e; but I hope his Maje&s;tie will neither accept of their &s;ervice, nor have any cau&s;e to v&s;e them.</P>

<HEAD>The King of Spaines Navy.</HEAD>
<P>THe Spaniard (like a crafty For) harh al|wayes weighted for his prey on <HI>England,</HI> which hath beene the &s;ole object of his greedy intentions. Witne&s;&s;e fir&s;t that formidable and invincible Armado in 88. which was &s;uffici|ently potent to have bla&s;ted the whole Kingdome at one brunt, had not the divine protection aver|ted it from vs.</P>
<PB REF="4">
<P>Now likewi&s;e the King of <HI>Spain</HI> perceiving a &s;edition, and various confu&s;ion in the Kingdome, hath provided a fleet con&s;i&s;ting of 23. &s;hips, under the Command of Captain <HI>Don Pedringano,</HI> to the number of 8000. &s;ouldiers, waiting on the Seas for his opportunity. The&s;e &s;hips were e&s;pyed a hundred leagues di&s;tant from the Spani&s;h Coa&s;t, &s;ome think his intent hereby is for the defence of his own Country, but that &s;eems improbable, in regard it is &s;o far remote from their own &s;hore: o|thers think verily that his meaning is to aid, and a&s;&s;i&s;t his Maje&s;ty upon ju&s;t occa&s;ion: but in my opinion I conceive his intent is to wait rather for his own prey, and watching his opportunity: for tho&s;e that are too officious in warlike affairs, e&s;pe|cially in a forraign Kingdome, will rather regard their own ends, then any others, for they will al|wais turn to the &s;tronge&s;t &s;ide: But I hope all his evill intentions, and private &s;tratagems will fall on his own head.</P>

<HEAD>The States of Venices Navie.</HEAD>
<P>THe <HI>Italians</HI> &s;eriou&s;ly under&s;tanding &s;ome wrongs offered unto his Maje&s;ty, acquain|ted the States of <HI>Venice</HI> with the &s;ame. Who immediatly &s;ate in Councell about it, and after &s;ome mature deliberation concluded to &s;et out a Navie to a&s;&s;i&s;t his Maje&s;ty, which was una|nimou&s;ly confirmed, and a&s;&s;ented unto their fleet con&s;i&s;teth of 48. &s;hips, under the Commad of Cap|taine
<PB REF="4"><HI>Hupah Fenao,</HI> there being at the lea&s;t 36000. &s;ouldiers, being al&s;o provided with &s;trong ammu|nition of arms: they lye now within le&s;&s;e then 40. leagues from the Downs, and are &s;uddenly inten|ded to appropinquate the Engli&s;h Coa&s;t, being all unitely re&s;olved to maintain the Kings own per&s;on from all injuries, or abu&s;es: but I hope the Kings clemency will mittigate their anger, and no doubt, but that His Maje&s;ty will not entertain them, ha|ving no cau&s;e of any &s;uch vindication.</P>

<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<P>COn&s;tancy is an Antidote again&s;t fear: wher|fore let us be &s;incerely con&s;tant in our minds, and we may ea&s;ily expell fear from our thoughts. Fir&s;t con&s;tant to God, con&s;tant to our King, con|&s;tant to our Parliament, con&s;tant to our &s;elves, and la&s;tly con&s;tant to truth and equity. The&s;e being tru|ly performed, we need not to fear either any for|raign or dome&s;tick enemy, As for the&s;e Navies a|forementioned, they may perhaps ca&s;t a repercu&s;&s;ive fear and a&s;toni&s;hment into the minds of &s;ome: but if we be really true, and con&s;tant in our minds, we need not fear them.</P>
<P>As for tho&s;e injuries, and abu&s;es done to His Ma|je&s;ty, which they intend, and are re&s;olved to vindi|cate, for my own part, I am ignorant of any; which if there were, I believe His Maje&s;ty is more loving, and tender over his Subjects, then for &s;ome particu|lar abu&s;e to depopulate the whole Kingdome in re|venge
<PB REF="5">of the &s;ame. And the Parliament are &s;o judi|cious in their pious way, and in all their mature Coun&s;els, that if any known, and unju&s;t injury &s;holy be offered unto his Maje&s;ty, they would (I am con|fident) according to Equity and Iu&s;tice correct the &s;ame. And they are &s;o vigilant, and carefull for the &s;afety, and &s;ecurity of the Kingdome, that if any e|nemy &s;hould violently oppo&s;e us, they would bee &s;peedily provided for them in defedce of the Realm. God grant that the King and Parliament may &s;o u|nitely accord, and corre&s;pond together, that no cau&s;e of Fears, and Iealou&s;ies, that no &s;u&s;pition of injuries, may be reflected on either.</P>
