<HEAD>The Introduction</HEAD>
<P>_LIke as the Deep doth at all times declare the marvellous wonders of that great Authour, Guider, and Pre&s;erver of all things; &s;o it mu&s;t needs be a marvellous occupation; neither can it bee but mo&s;t glorious to the minde of any creature, to exerci&s;e it &s;elf on that &s;ubject whereon the Spirit of God was plea&s;ed to move, before all things were.</P>
<P>Certainly <HI>Navigation</HI> (whereof wee &s;hall now treat) cannot but afford a glorious delight to the mindes of Lovers of Knowledge; as the Seas afford a world of Wealth unto tho&s;e that make <HI>Navigation</HI> their Profe&s;|&s;ion.</P>
<P>Is it not as rare as wonderfull, that with an In&s;trument &s;o little as an <HI>A&s;tralabo</HI> is, and that with a Sea compa&s;&s;e.</P>
<P>By the fir&s;t you may mea&s;ure the Circles of the Hea|vens, the height and di&s;tance of the Sunne, and Starres.</P>
<PB N="6" REF="5">
<P> By the &s;econd, (which hath neither mouth, tongue, legges, nor hands) man is directed, guided, and &s;hewne where the Ea&s;t, We&s;t, North, and South are (not only in the &s;teddie&s;t ca&s;e a ve&s;&s;el can be, but when the moved waves to&s;&s;eth the &s;ame as it were towards the clouds, and thence lets it reele as into an Aby&s;&s;e) its no wonder then that <HI>Solomon</HI> the wi&s;e&s;t of all men &s;aid, that the harde&s;t thing to be found, was the way a Ship makes through the Seas. And is not the wonder &s;o much the greater, that it findes its &s;treight cour&s;e through that va&s;t perpetuall moving, and removing body, &s;o exactly, when the Firmament appeares as black as Inke, and all the lights of Heaven are covered with the darkne&s;&s;e of the night, (like as with an extingui&s;her) as well as in the cleare&s;t day.</P>
<P>Is it not a wonder above all wonders, that after &s;o ma|ny moneths Navigations, and that after &s;uch varieties, changes of winds, intermixture of &s;tormes, the violence of Tides, &s;o con&s;tantly changeable, that a ve&s;&s;el arrives to the mouth of an Harbour, as &s;treight as if it were a Ferry Boat drawn by a cord, fa&s;tned from one &s;hoare to the other.</P>
<P>With the royall Prophet <HI>David,</HI> let all men &s;ay; <HI>Qui de&s;cendunt mare in Navibus, facientes operationem in a|quis multis, ip&s;i viderunt opera Domini, &amp; mirabilia ejus in profundo dixit,</HI> &amp; <HI>&s;tetit &s;piritus procella: Et exaltati &s;unt flu|ctus ejus.

<PB N="7" REF="5">mi&s;ericordiae ejus,</HI> &amp; <HI>mirabilia ejus filiis hominam.</HI> That is They that goe downe to the Sea in &s;hips, that doe bu&s;i|ne&s;&s;e in great waters, the&s;e &s;ee the workes of the Lord, and his wonders in the deep; for he commandeth, and rai&s;eth the &s;tormy wind, which lifteth up the waves thereof; they mount up to the Heaven, they goe down againe to the depths, their &s;oule is melted becau&s;e of trouble, they reele to and fro, and &s;tagger like a drunken man, and are at their wits end; then they cry unto the Lord in their di&s;tre&s;&s;es. He maketh the &s;torme a calme, &s;o that the waves thereof are &s;till; then are they glad becau&s;e they be quiet, &s;o he bringeth them unto their de&s;ired haven: O that men would prai&s;e the Lord for his goodne&s;&s;e, and for his wonderfull workes to the children of men, <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 107.</P>
<P>Let us then &s;o profit by this pre&s;ent meditation, wherein we &s;hall finde the great benefit of the Art of Navigation, in that it doth not only &s;erve for the tran&s;|portation both of men and goods, from the remote&s;t parts of the world, and towards the which God was not plea&s;ed to pre&s;cribe any high wayes, for Carts, nor For|ces; but to make men acquainted with all &s;uch parts, in which God doth manife&s;t the varieties of his power, and of his bottomles trea&s;ures; even &s;o doth he likewi&s;e with Nations, in &s;ome of which his divine fatherly mercy is glorified, and his Ju&s;tice made more apparent, rendring man al&s;o more capable to participate of tho&s;e innume|rous riches; by all what the Indian precious &s;hoares are garni&s;hed with, by all the golden bowels of the earth, where Nature by the Sun-beams is made capable of &s;uch productions, by what the Mother-wombe of pearls is po&s;&s;e&s;t with, by that wherewith <HI>Aarons</HI> brea&s;t was made &s;o &s;hining glorious; men load their Ve&s;&s;els as freely
<PB N="8" REF="6">as Carts on other grounds, with the mo&s;t ordinary fruits, and productions of the earth.</P>
<P>Navigation may therefore well be termed the mo&s;t profitable of all Sciences, and Arts, for man-kinde; if he can make that u&s;e of it, as may ju&s;tly draw ble&s;&s;ings unto him; which is to be compa&s;t by doing that, &s;o ear|ne&s;tly wi&s;ht for by the afore&s;aid King <HI>David; O that men would prai&s;e the Lord for his goodne&s;&s;e, and for his wonderfull workes to the children of men.</HI></P>
<P>And by being as ready to labour in his cau&s;e (in which no Soule can &s;uffer any &s;hip-wrack) as to hazard Life, Ship, and Goods, for tran&s;itory things.</P>
<P>We &s;hall begin with the Sea, and &s;ay fir&s;t what it is, and why it is called Ocean.</P>
<P>The Sea is all the va&s;t extent of water which environs the earth.</P>
<P>The waters were created by God, <HI>In principio creavit Deus coelum &amp; Terram, &amp; Spiritus Domini ferebatur &s;uper aquas.</HI> In the beginning God created the Heavens and the Earth, and the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters. This is confirmed by the writs of <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> in his generation, or off-&s;pring of this world.</P>
<P>The Water doth engender, and maintaine it &s;elf in the Sea; the Rivers come from it, and return unto it.</P>
<P>The <HI>Aegyptians</HI> have &s;uppo&s;ed foure Elements, of each one whereof they made two; the one Male, and the other Female: they beleeve that the Aire which engen|ders the wind is the Male, and that which is loaden with clouds, and which doth not &s;tirre, to be the Female; they call the Water male, and all other Waters female; they &s;ay that the fire (the flame whereof burnes) is male, and that which &s;hineth (without doing harme) is the female. They doe beleeve that the harde&s;t Earth,
<PB N="9" REF="6">as the Stones, and Rocks are males, and give the name of female to that which is manuable.</P>
<P>The Sea is called Ocean, by rea&s;on of its quick and continuall motion; for <HI>Oris</HI> in Greek, is to ha&s;ten, or el&s;e it's called, <HI>Ocean qua&s;i Cianeus,</HI> for it embraces the Rivers of the earth.</P>
<P>The Sea receives &s;everall names from the diver&s;ity of places, by the which it pa&s;&s;eth, as the Sea of <HI>China, India, Per&s;ia,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>The Sea properly hath no colour, for our &s;ight doth not remaine on the &s;uperficies of the water, but de&s;cends lower, and at a great di&s;tance its colour is like that of Heaven, but being di&s;turbed by the Winds it is &s;u&s;cep|tible, of divers colours.</P>
<P>It's to be noted, that the Sea ri&s;eth, increa&s;ing &s;even dayes, which is called quick water, and &s;even other dayes it retires decrea&s;ing, which is called dead water. <HI>Ari&s;totle</HI> treats of the cau&s;es of the increa&s;ing and decrea|&s;ing in the &s;econd of the Meteors; as al&s;o <HI>Hippocrates</HI> in the Booke of the Aire, and Waters; where he &s;ayes, that there is a proper cau&s;e of A&s;trologie, <HI>viz.</HI> by the na|turall vertue which the Moone hath on the Waters; therefore we &s;ee all that's in the Sea increa&s;eth, and de|crea&s;eth, as the Moone doth; for as the Moone happens to ri&s;e on the Horizon, and that &s;he toucheth the Sea with her beames, &s;o doth &s;he rai&s;e a &s;urging on the Sea, which cau&s;eth its increa&s;e, and decrea&s;e; the which &s;hall be more largely di&s;cus'd in its proper time, and place.</P>

<PB N="10" REF="7">
<HEAD>How the Sea belongs to the Perfection of the world, that it would have peri&s;hed without the &s;ame, and how the waters are ingendered by the Sea.</HEAD>
<P>THe World could not have been perfect without the Sea, for that if there were no beginning of waters, there would bee no &s;imple water; and if there were no &s;imple water, there would be no mixt water; and &s;o there could not be any thing of that which is ingendered by water. And if there were no water found, nothing con&s;i&s;ting of a body could bee continued, or congluti|nated.</P>
<P>If there were no beginning of Waters, generation would be de&s;troyed, and con&s;equently all the World. Neither without the beginning of Waters could all the a&s;&s;emblings of contraries be performed; though they are po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>Thus nature would be deficient in tho&s;e things which are unavoidably nece&s;&s;ary, and conducing to the &s;ame. And its property, and vertue failing, the waters would be hindered in their action, by which it would happen (there being no beginning of waters) that the workman|&s;hip of nature would peri&s;h, and con&s;equently the whole World.</P>
<P><HI>Ari&s;totle</HI> (in the &s;econd of the <HI>Meteors</HI>) &s;ayes, that the <HI>Waters of the Seas ingender in the North:</HI> He would &s;ay, that the greate&s;t part of the waters of the Sea are ingendred in the North. As <HI>Albert</HI> the great declares (in the &s;e|cond of the <HI>Meteors</HI> the &s;ixth Chapter, where he &s;ayes) that the Sea runs from the North to the South, and the cau&s;e is, that the Sea is higher in the North, then to|wards the South; and the rea&s;on why it is higher, is, be|cau&s;e
<PB N="11" REF="7">that the cold of the North ingenders more water than the Sea can contain in the &s;pace, di&s;tance, and height, of its coa&s;t there. The water which is in the South is con&s;umed and dimini&s;hed by the heat of the Sun, there|fore one part of the South water, drives the other back towards the lowermo&s;t &s;ide, yet neverthele&s;&s;e either mo|veth accidentally from the place of their generation, be|cau&s;e that which is moi&s;t runs to be retained in the dry part.</P>
<P>The rea&s;on why the water con&s;umes it &s;elfe &s;o much in the South, is, becau&s;e the Sunne turnes alwayes in his excentrique circle: and that its center is not the &s;ame with that of the Earth, &s;o that if the Diameter, of the cir|cle of the &s;un were pa&s;&s;ed between two Diameters, its cen|ter and that of the Earth, the greate&s;t part of the Diameter would be at one &s;ide, and the le&s;&s;er at the other, in con|&s;ideration of the Center of the Earth.</P>
<P>And thus it is Geometrically demon&s;trated, that the greate&s;t length of the Diameter is neare the twen|tieth degree of <HI>Gemini,</HI> and that the lea&s;t length of it is at the twentieth degree of <HI>Sagitarius,</HI> its oppo&s;ite &s;igne. It appeares then, that the Sunne approaches nearer unto the Earth in the Southerne parts then in the Northerne; and thus by its approaching the South, heats it &s;o violent|ly, that it con&s;umes the water, and &s;corches the Earth, which it doth not at the North.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Wherefore the Water of the Sea is brini&s;h and &s;alt, and that &s;uch Water is be&s;t for Navigation.</HEAD>
<P>THe matter which cau&s;es the Sea to be brini&s;h, and &s;alt, is, becau&s;e that there are two &s;orts of vapours in the Sea, <HI>viz.</HI> Hot, and Moi&s;t; and Hot, and Dry: The
<PB N="12" REF="8">one whereof evaporates it &s;elfe from the &s;uperficies of the Sea, and the other rai&s;eth it &s;elfe from its bottome, by force of the Sunne, and Stars, which are the effici|ent cau&s;es of its vapours, and becau&s;e that the vapour of the water is very &s;ubtle, between the&s;e two, therefore it elevates it &s;elf in the Aire, and is con&s;umed by the Sun, and there remaineth nothing el&s;e but the exhalations of the Earth, the which are di&s;&s;ipated, extended, and mingled among the water, as appeares by the exam|ple of tho&s;e who eate, for the dige&s;ted meat, &s;preads and divides it &s;elfe through the members, and all the gro&s;&s;e and undige&s;ted &s;ub&s;tance remains: In the like manner al&s;o, the vapour of the Earth, having extended it &s;elfe, re|maines mixt with the &s;ub&s;tance of the Sea water, and the coldne&s;&s;e of the Water drives in &s;o coldly, as it con|&s;umes it &s;elfe by its owne coldne&s;&s;e, becau&s;e of its min|gling by Antyperi&s;ta&s;is, which is to &s;ay, that two contra|ry things joyned together, become &s;tronger then before, for the heat of the exhalation (which i&s;&s;ues from the bot|tom of the Sea) fortifies it &s;elf by the vertue of the Sun, with its contrary, to wit, the coldne&s;&s;e, and thus the Heat happens to overcome, which is the nece&s;&s;ary opera|tion towards the begetting of the &s;alti&s;h water.</P>
<P>It is al&s;o more convenient for Navigation, that the water be &s;alti&s;h then fre&s;h, for the &s;alti&s;h water is heavi|er then the fre&s;h: That it is &s;o, is proved by many expe|riences, as for example, this one: Take Fre&s;h water, and mingle it with a good quantity of &s;alt, &s;o that the Salt may melt, and be di&s;&s;olved into water, then take a Fre&s;h eg, and put it on the mixt water, the thicknes of the water (which proceeds from the mixture of the Salt) wil bearup the egg by its thicknes, &amp; wil cau&s;e it to &s;wim over it, the which in fre&s;h water would de&s;cend to the bottom.
<PB N="13" REF="8">By this &s;ame experience it may likewi&s;e be demon&s;trated that a ve&s;&s;el will &s;inck &s;ooner in Fre&s;h water then in Salt water, for the fre&s;h water divides it &s;elfe both &s;ooner, and clo&s;es with greater ea&s;e then the &s;alt water doth. So as by the driving of the egg on the &s;alt water, the ar|gument may be likewi&s;e &s;trengthened: That the &s;alti&s;h|ne&s;&s;e in the Sea water is not divided, but that the whole Sea throughout, its water is as well &s;alt at the bottome, and in the midde&s;t, as on the &s;uperficies; And there|fore the opinion of &s;ome Philo&s;ophers, that the &s;ea wa|ter &s;hould be fre&s;h at the bottome, is frivolous, being that the Sea-Fi&s;h is no more &s;alt then tho&s;e of fre&s;h water Rivers: And that the rea&s;on thereof &s;hould be, that the fi&s;h make their litter and feed in the bottome, which being but a &s;light argument, it will be nece&s;&s;ary to &s;ay only this thereon.</P>
<P>That though the body of the Sea moves in an entire ma&s;&s;e, by its ebbing and flowing, yet &s;ince its a liquid body, it cannot chu&s;e (being &s;o much agitated by the winds) but be generally &s;alt: And the which cannot be contradicted by &s;o weak a conceit as that the &s;ea-fi&s;h are not &s;alt, becau&s;e they feed at the bottome of it. God hath given unto the Elements their due propriety, as wel as unto all the creatures, and likewi&s;e to all the produ|ctions, both of the earth and &s;ea: And there is no more contradiction of a po&s;&s;ibility in Fi&s;h that live in &s;alt wa|ter to have a fre&s;h ta&s;te, then that the moy&s;ture which proceeds from the <HI>Mu&s;cadine Spani&s;h</HI> grape, &s;hould be drawne from the &s;ame &s;oyl, whereon the bitter Almond, Olive, and the balmi&s;h Nuts oyle doth grow, who&s;e &s;everall productions are according to that property which God hath been plea&s;ed to be&s;tow on them.</P>
<P>The Earth it &s;elfe is &s;alt, which the Scripture notes,
<PB N="14" REF="9">for if the earth lo&s;eth its Salt, wherewith &s;hall it be &s;ea|&s;oned; and yet the &s;ame earth produceth Sugar, though a Salt to pre&s;erve Fruits; and contrary to the Salt of the Sea, &amp;c. And likewi&s;e &s;everall other things, out of which though Salt might be drawn, yet they have not the falti&s;h ta&s;te, &amp;c.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Of the different Motions which are in the Ocean.</HEAD>
<P>GReat part of the Waters are ingendered in the North, and runs from the North towards the South as afore&s;aid, (which is one of the Seas motions) When the Tide increa&s;eth, we &s;ee the &s;ea mounts at one &s;ide, and when it decrea&s;eth, its motion is quite contrary, and it begins fir&s;t to decrea&s;e where it had the fir&s;t increa&s;e; and thus it appears that the &s;ea hath contrary motions, and different the one from the other,</P>
<P><HI>Seneca</HI> &s;ayes, that there is no other cau&s;e of the cur|rent of Waters from one place to another, then the height and lowne&s;&s;e of places; that only motion excep|ted by the which the Sea increa&s;eth, and decrea&s;eth; for (as afore&s;aid) it followes the cour&s;e of the Moone, for the waters of the Sea increa&s;e, and decrea&s;e in all the parts of the World, that is to &s;ay, in the Ea&s;t, We&s;t, North, and South; therefore the Sea hath no proper place from whence it begins its increa&s;ing, or decrea&s;ing, but moveth accidentally from one part to the other, unle&s;&s;e it be downwards towards the bottome; for that &s;uch a motion doth not happen accidentally, but by the proper e&s;&s;ence agreeing to its forme.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<PB N="15" REF="9">
<HEAD>How it chanceth that the Sea doth neither over-flow, augment, nor inlarge it &s;elfe.</HEAD>
<P>THe cau&s;e why the Sea doth not over-flow, augment, nor inlarge it &s;elfe, though &s;o much water is engen|dered in it, and that it doth continually receive &s;o many Rivers and Fountaines into it; is, that the Sea is the natu|rall receptacle of all the Waters, and their proper reti|ring and re&s;ting place, and therefore it doth not over|flow, nor inlarge it &s;elfe; for that no place can drive back, nor hinder the entrance of that thing which by nature ought to be in her, &s;ince naturally the place ought to conforme it &s;elfe unto that which it inclo&s;eth; like as the Sea, which being capable to receive into her all the Rivers, and neverthele&s;&s;e for their entrance doth not over-flow, nor augment. Al&s;o the Sea doth not o|verflow, becau&s;e it is of &s;uch a va&s;t extent, that the Rivers are as nothing in con&s;ideration to it. The third rea&s;on is, becau&s;e that the heat of the Sun, and the breath of the Wind, con&s;umes &s;uch a quantity of Water, that though the Sea continually engenders, and that the Rivers in|ce&s;&s;antly run into it; yea God hath ordained, that it &s;hould not le&s;&s;en, nor augment, as it is written in <HI>Job, Lord, thou ha&s;t &s;et a limit, the which it &s;hall not pa&s;&s;e.</HI> The holy Writ &s;ayes in <HI>Gene&s;is,</HI> that the water of the Deluge, did ri&s;e fifteene Cubits over the highe&s;t Hils under the Heavens, in&s;omuch that all the Earth was covered with water. But though this increa&s;ing of water was &s;o great, yet neverthele&s;&s;e the Sea did not over-flow the Earth, by tran&s;gre&s;&s;ing its limits or bounds.</P>
<P>The increa&s;ing of tho&s;e Waters proceeded from two cau&s;es; the one was, that <HI>the windowes of Heaven were
<PB N="16" REF="10">opened,</HI> as the Text &s;ayes, <HI>and it rained on the earth forty dayes, and forty nights exceedingly;</HI> the other was, that the Fountaines, Rivers, and Currents did over-flow, in|&s;omuch that the earth was by them covered, as afore&s;aid, <HI>and every living &s;ub&s;tance was de&s;troyed which was upon the face of the ground,</HI> except <HI>Noah,</HI> who only remained alive, and they that were with him in the Arke; and after|wards the &s;ame Text &s;ayes, <HI>that God cau&s;ed a wind to pa&s;&s;e over the earth, which abated the waters; the raine from Hea|ven was al&s;o re&s;trained, and the earth returned to its fir&s;t being.</HI></P>

<P>GOd the Creator of the univer&s;all World, did ordaine the making of the fir&s;t Ve&s;&s;el, as it is written in the &s;ixth Chapter of <HI>Gene&s;is,</HI> that God commanded <HI>Noah</HI> to make an Arke of Gopher wood, and to pitch it within, and without with pitch; the length of the Arke was of three hundred cubits, the breadth of it fifty cubits, and the height of it thirty cubits.</P>
<P>The <HI>Lydians</HI> were the fir&s;t inventers of Ships, but their skill only extended it &s;elfe to joyne one beame to ano|ther well nailed, and well caulked, with which they ven|tured to Sea; afterwards <HI>Epaminondas</HI> did &s;et forth Ve&s;|&s;els in a greater perfection to &s;aile withall, &s;o that the famous Captaine <HI>Bias</HI> was &s;eene in the Peloponen&s;ian War, both with Ships, Charricks, and Gallies.</P>
<P><HI>Solomon</HI> King of <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> &s;ent two Ships into <HI>Thar&s;is,</HI> which both went and returned each third yeare, and brought Gold, Silver, Ivory, and divers other things.</P>
<P><HI>Julius Solinus</HI> &s;ayes, that all the Meridian Sea which embraces <HI>Africa,</HI> was &s;ayled about from the <HI>Indies</HI> to <HI>Spaine.</HI></P>

<P>Before <HI>Plato's</HI> time, there were Ve&s;&s;els that &s;ayled from the I&s;le of <HI>Cadiz,</HI> which is at the entry of the Straits of <HI>Gibraltar,</HI> to the <HI>Ea&s;t Indies.</HI></P>
<P>When <HI>Tiberius Cae&s;ar</HI> did governe the Empire, there were &s;eene in the Arabian Sea, en&s;ignes of Ve&s;&s;els floa|ting, which the <HI>Spaniards</HI> had lo&s;t.</P>
<P>In the time of <HI>Augu&s;tus Cae&s;ar,</HI> the greate&s;t part of the Ocean Sea was &s;ayled through.</P>
<P>When <HI>Seleucus</HI> and <HI>Antiochus</HI> did reigne, all the coa&s;t of the Ca&s;pian Sea was &s;ayled through, and knowne by the Macedonian Armies.</P>
<P>The King of <HI>Switzerland</HI> gave to <HI>Metellus</HI> &s;ome <HI>Indians,</HI> which &s;ayling with Merchandi&s;es, were driven by a Tempe&s;t from their Country to <HI>Germany.</HI></P>
<P>In the time of the Teutonicall Emperours, there were <HI>Ea&s;t Indian</HI> Emba&s;&s;adours found on the <HI>Germaine</HI> coa&s;t, which were driven thither by the violence of the wind.</P>
<P>Some Authors write of great numbers and multitude of Ships which were in ancient times, as tho&s;e of the <HI>A&s;&s;yrians, Per&s;ians, Grecians,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P><HI>Homer</HI> writes, that the <HI>Grecian</HI> Navie which came to <HI>Troy,</HI> con&s;i&s;ted of one thou&s;and, one hundred, and foure|&s;core Ships.</P>
<P><HI>Xerxes</HI> King of <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> came with five thou&s;and, five hundred Ships, &s;even hundred thou&s;and men, and three hundred thou&s;and of his friends and allies, to the de&s;tru|ction of <HI>Greece,</HI> and being come to the Pontick Sea, he made a Bridge of Ships over it, on the which he pa&s;&s;ed with his Army.</P>

<HEAD>The u&s;e of Navigation</HEAD>
<P>IS cheifly to de&s;cry the dangers which are by the way, as Rocks, Sands, and &s;uch other like impediments, and to know how to avoid them: How far the places are di|&s;tant, what wind or point of the Compa&s;&s;e &s;erves to fail unto them; and al&s;o when the windes fall out cro&s;&s;e by the way, to con&s;ider how to direct the Ve&s;&s;ell, and to take the mo&s;t advantagious cour&s;e to attaine unto the in|tended Port in a convenient time.

<P>SEverall &s;tormes, both at high winds, and troubled raging Seas, often fall out, whereby both the lo&s;&s;e of &s;hips, and perill of the Sea mens lives are threatned, and other eminent dangers: We will declare by what &s;ignes they may bee fore&s;een; and fir&s;t by ob&s;ervations on the Sunne.</P>
<P>At the &s;unne ri&s;ing, if you perceive before it reddi&s;h Clouds, and that they drive, &s;ome towards the North, and &s;ome towards the South, &s;ignifies winds and great Raines.</P>
<P>If before the &s;unne ri&s;ing, you &s;ee &s;ome round clouds hover about it, withdrawing towards the South after that the Sunne is ri&s;en, it &s;ignifies great cold, but if they doe withdraw towards the Sunne &s;etting, they &s;ignifie faire weather.</P>
<PB N="19" REF="11">
<P> When the Sun &s;preads its beams far through the Aire, and that there &s;eems to be &s;ome hollowne&s;&s;e in it, near the middle of the Sunne, that &s;ignifies Raine.</P>
<P>When ere the Sunne ri&s;es, its beames are perceived, that &s;ignifies Raines, and Winds.</P>
<P>When the Sun &s;ets having its circle white, that &s;ignifies &s;tormes for the night in&s;uing.</P>
<P>When the Sun is faire and cleare, without ca&s;ting any extraordinary heates at its ri&s;ing, that &s;ignifies a faire and cleare day, If it &s;eemes to be yellow, it then &s;ignifies rain and Haile.</P>

<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>What the wind is, its qualities, and how its ingendred.</HEAD>
<P>THe wind is an evaporation of the Earth, which a&s;|&s;cends above the Aire, who&s;e vapour is hot and dry, and the which pierces the Aire by its &s;ubtilty, for as the wind in its &s;pecies is of a &s;ubtle vapour, and that the Na|ture of &s;ubtle things is to a&s;cend, therefore its a&s;cents are made by the &s;ubtle vapours of the Earth, from whence it is driven back again about the Earth, by the coldne&s;&s;e of the middlemo&s;t Regions ayre.</P>
<P>So that the off-Spring and motion of the wind, pro|ceeds from above, and its matter from beneath.</P>
<PB N="21" REF="12">
<P> At the beginning the winds have no great force, but the farther they blow, the more they increa&s;e in &s;trength, becau&s;e of the new exhalations which are mingled with them: As it happens in Floods, which though but little in their births, yet do augment and continually increa&s;e by the reception of new additionall waters.</P>
<P>When two contrary winds meet, the weake&s;t always yeelds unto the &s;tronge&s;t, and this makes a whirle-wind, which cau&s;es the lo&s;&s;e of Ships, when they chance to be under the power of &s;uch a Whirle-wind.</P>
<P>The exhalations of which the winds are made, do not on the &s;uddaine yeeld to the Clouds which they meete with in the Aire; but &s;trive to overcome them, and &s;o to force their pa&s;&s;age for their a&s;cent: and &s;o it happens that ere they blow here beneath; we &s;ee the Clouds above move, by the agitation of the winds.</P>
<P>And becau&s;e the winds are compo&s;ed of different mat|ters, and qualities, to tho&s;e which forme the Raine, they cannot la&s;t long together, but alwayes &s;truggle and &s;trive untill they have overcome each other. And Raine mo&s;t commonly gets the better, unle&s;&s;e the wind be provided with a great quantity of matter and &s;ub&s;tance.</P>
<P>Nor can the winds maintaine it &s;elfe again&s;t the vehe|mency of extreame heats, nor again&s;t the rigour of ex|treame cold: becau&s;e the vehemency of heat di&s;per&s;es, and di&s;&s;ipates it, and the rigour of the cold congeales and clo&s;es it up with the Clouds, and afterwards reduceth it into Raine.</P>
<P>The Divine providence of God, in the creation and di&s;po&s;ition of the winds, is worthy to be admired; not becau&s;e the ambition of men have made thereof an In|&s;trument, and &s;courge to ruine them&s;elves, by abu&s;ing thereof, as mo&s;t men do, mo&s;t imprudently, and vain|ly:
<PB N="22" REF="13">As <HI>Xerxes</HI> King of <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> did; who though he pa&s;&s;ed the Seas to go to <HI>Greece;</HI> yet could he not vanqui&s;h it, though he had in a manner covered it with Souldiers.</P>
<P>So <HI>Alexander:</HI> who having pa&s;&s;ed the <HI>Indies,</HI> yet would have &s;earcht for &s;omething more, even beyond the great Sea, and it greived him to heare that hee was at the worlds ends</P>
<P>But as for the incomprehen&s;ible bounty of God, who hath di&s;po&s;ed of the windes into &s;o many parts, for the pre&s;ervation of the Earth, and Aire in a &s;weet tempe|rance, for the bringing in of Raines, and afterwards the driving of them back, both for the nouri&s;hing of Fruits, Seeds, and all fruit Trees, which by the agitation of the winds, and other cau&s;es, are ripened, giving likewi&s;e nou|ri&s;hment to the Corne, which it ripens, and pre&s;erves from drying and withering. U&s;efull likewi&s;e to Man, towards the di&s;covery of Forraigne parts, and remote Countryes, unto which unle&s;&s;e a man &s;hould travell, he &s;hould be farre more ignorant then many bruite bea&s;ts, wanting the experience of divers things, which conduce towards the bettering of his under&s;tanding, &amp;c.</P>
