<HEAD>The State of the Navy con&s;ider'd In relation to the VICTUALLING, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE Mi&s;managements of the Navy &s;ince this Revolution have been &s;o abominable, that they could never have been born at &s;uch va&s;t expence, but by an ea&s;y People, fond of a Government of their own &s;etting up, and of a King &s;utable to the Genius of the Engli&s;h Nation, and worthy of Immortal Honor, notwith&s;tanding the Male-Admini&s;tration of the Officers employed under him. Will not fu|ture Ages blu&s;h at the in&s;en&s;ible Temper of their Forefathers, when they &s;hall read of the e&s;cape of the <HI>Thoulon</HI> Fleet into <HI>Bre&s;t,</HI> and the abominable Affair of Mon&s;ieur <HI>Pointi?</HI> When they read the horrid Stories of our be|ing gull'd out of Mony rais'd for publick Service, and diverted to private and &s;ini&s;ter Ends, will they not wi&s;h tho&s;e Sums had been tran&s;mitted to them to be employ'd in more generous Atchievements? But as Clouds of|ten ari&s;e over the more clear Under&s;tandings and wi&s;e&s;t Heads, &s;o Nations &s;ometimes become delirious, and hurry into Ruin, till kind Heaven remove the pernicious Frenzy. Had the Mi&s;managements of the Navy tended only to the Con&s;umption of our Wealth, the Lo&s;s might have been repaired; but when our Sailors are poi&s;on'd by bad Provi&s;ions, or &s;tarv'd for want of good, the lo&s;s is irreparable. Thus the Blood of War is profu&s;ely &s;pilt in louzy Hammocks, &s;tagnated with noi&s;om Scents, and the flower of our youthful Sailors &s;mothered in un&s;ucce&s;sful and needle&s;s Voyages, who might have won to them&s;elves and the Nation immortal Wreaths of Honour in no|ble Attempts upon the Enemy. This Decrea&s;e of Seamen looks more like a De&s;ign upon the Engli&s;h Nation, than the effect of Providence. He that abandons him&s;elf to a moro&s;e Temper in his &s;ickne&s;s, and will not take &s;uch Specificks as are e&s;&s;ential to his Recovery, is a <HI>&s;elo de &s;e:</HI> And &s;uch Officers as deny nece&s;&s;ary and good Provi&s;ions for Sea Service, can de&s;ign no other than the De&s;truction of the Sailors, and con&s;equently of the Nation. They undermine our National Walls, I mean our Shipping, which without Men are but Floating C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;tles, meer Machins of War altogether indefen&s;ible. The Hard&s;hips of the Sailors have indeed been worthy the Con&s;ideration of our Repre&s;entatives in Parliament. But poor Creatures, they have no body to repre&s;ent their Grievances, they are tumbl'd and to&s;s'd on the watry Ele|ment
<PB N="4" REF="4">perhaps 18 or 20 Months together in the <HI>Straits,</HI> and as &s;oon as they arrive in the Channel are turn'd over to other Ships bound to the <HI>We&s;t-Indies</HI> or other Parts, and not &s;uffer'd to come a&s;hoar and tell their Tale; or if they land, the nece&s;&s;itous good-natur'd Creatures &s;ell their Tic|kets for half the worth, bouze it about in a Can of Flip, or a Bowl of Punch, forget their Sorrow, and remember their Mi&s;ery no more. If any Complaints have been made, it has been done by the &s;tarv'd Wives and mi&s;e|rable Children of Mariners; if they have complain'd to tho&s;e Officers that &s;hould have done them Ju&s;tice, they might as well have told their Sto|ry to the Winds and devouring Billows, the treacherous Sands, and fatal Rocks, the natural Enemies of their Relations. Have they complained to Parliament? What Redre&s;s could they expect from &s;uch a Parliament as the la&s;t and preceding Parliaments, &s;o full of Courtiers, Judges of their own Cau&s;e, and Auditors of their own Accounts? The la&s;t Se&s;&s;ions of Parliament the poor Labourers, Artificers, and others, belonging to the Victualling-Office, petitioned for Arrears of Wages due to them; the Committee that exa|mined the Ca&s;e, con&s;i&s;ted mo&s;t part of the time but of &s;even Per&s;ons, when (I am told) according to the Cu&s;tom of Parliament they ought to have been eight: four of the &s;even I knew to be Commi&s;&s;ioners and Officers, and two of the four Per&s;ons complain'd again&s;t; tho the Ca&s;e was clear that they had &s;ome fifteen, others twelve, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Months due to them, and at the &s;ame time the Commi&s;&s;ioners and Officers received their Salaries quarterly, yet a Report of the poor Mens Ca&s;e was never made to the Hou&s;e. But the Ca&s;e of the Sailors is far wor&s;e than others; they have no Time, no Acquaintance, nor Intere&s;t to pro&s;ecute any thing of this Nature, and tho&s;e that abu&s;e and cheat 'em have got the Weathergage of them, they can &s;end 'em at any time on a long Errand to the E. or W. <HI>Indies</HI> far enough out of hearing: upon their return the Complaint is grown as mouldy as their Bread, and as ru&s;ty as their Pork and Beef have been during the Voyage, and therefore ought to be ca&s;t without Survey.</P>
<P>The Sailors Ca&s;e is indeed deplorable, kept long without pay, &s;ometimes fix years, forc'd to &s;ell Tickets to rai&s;e a little Mony for their Families at half value, tho as good and brave Engli&s;hmen as any; are altogether en&s;lav|ed, and without any Law that I ever heard of impre&s;t, their Liberty taken from them, which when gone they are effectual Slaves; impri&s;on'd on board Ship, caned and kick'd by Commanders ju&s;t dropt from behind a Coach at <HI>White-Hall</HI> into the Service of the Navy, mi&s;erably abus'd in being turn'd over from one Ship to another (contrary to the Rules of Humanity, and the Cu&s;tom of the Navy) &s;o that after they have been at Sea &s;everal years, are hurried out again without Liberty &s;o much as to &s;ee their Relations. Now all things con&s;ider'd, What Encouragement have Mariners to &s;erve their
<PB N="5" REF="4">Country in the Navy? The only thing they have a &s;eeming Certainty of is their Meat and Drink, and to be cheated of that too is the Devil.</P>
<P>The Parliaments of <HI>England</HI> have always made a generous Allowance for the maintenance of the Sailors, and e&s;pecially upon the Account of Victual|ling: but con&s;idering how damnably Funds are clipt, how many hands Mony pa&s;&s;es through, and every one of them mu&s;t have a &s;nack out of it, it is no wonder if our Sailors Guts are pinch'd, and appear like half &s;tarv'd Mortals, rather re&s;embling the carv'd wooden Images in the Stern than the Ship's Crew. Go to <HI>Smithfield</HI> fir&s;t, and &s;ee there the Oxen bought, and very mode&s;t|ly compute the Buyers Snip out of 'em to be 60000 <HI>l.</HI> &s;ince the Revolution; follow the Cattel to the Victualling-Office, and &s;ee an unde&s;cended Wretch there receiving them, advanc'd from thredbare Clothes &s;ince the Revolution to the Sum of twenty thou&s;and Pound got out of a Salary of eighty Pounds <HI>per annum;</HI> be&s;ides a Journy-man Apothecary, and a Skipper at the Board, rais'd from abject Nothing to wonderful Pomp. The&s;e things con&s;ider'd, the Sailors mu&s;t make &s;mall Meals; and it dos plainly demon&s;trate how our Funds become deficient, when &s;o many ob&s;cure Per&s;ons of no intrin&s;ick Value or Worth mu&s;t get E&s;tates out of them. But to proceed to the Con|dition of the Victualling &s;ince the Revolution.</P>
<P>Soon after the Revolution and the honourable Fight off <HI>Beachy,</HI> Sir <HI>John Par&s;ons</HI> and Company, the then Commi&s;&s;ioners of the Victualling, were complain'd again&s;t in Parliament for poi&s;oning the Sailors, by putting Guts in the Beer, and Galls in the packing of the Fle&s;h, which put the Sailors into a Flux, whereof great numbers of them dy'd: The Commi&s;&s;ioners in their own Ju&s;tification alledg'd, That the Beer being ropy, as often it is, and recovers it &s;elf again, might occa&s;ion that Mi&s;take by &s;ome ig|norant Sailors: That the Galls happened in the packing by rea&s;on of &s;ome Bags of Galls that broke on board the Ship, from whence the Salt was taken, wherewith the Fle&s;h was packed. I &s;hall neither ju&s;tify nor condemn tho&s;e Commi&s;&s;ioners; but I always wonder'd how Galls &s;hould have different Virtues by Sea and Land, for that very year I was cured in <HI>Ireland</HI> of a violent bloody Flux, by taking Powder of Galls: However hereupon Sir <HI>John</HI> and the re&s;t were di&s;mi&s;s'd from their Imployments. This Remove always &s;eem'd to me to be made by &s;ome Per&s;ons to make room for the pre&s;ent Commi&s;&s;ioners; nor do I believe the pre&s;ent Com|mi&s;&s;ioners them&s;elves think their Predece&s;&s;ors guilty of any Crime: for up|on the E&s;tabli&s;hment of the pre&s;ent Commi&s;&s;ion, tho&s;e very Per&s;ons that put the Guts in the Beer and Galls into the Cask, were continued in their pla|ces, and the only Favourites of the pre&s;ent Commi&s;&s;ion, &s;o that Sir <HI>John Par&s;ons</HI> and Company were to bear the Sins of the whole Office, as King <HI>James</HI> did of the whole Nation, none &s;uffering for Male-Admini&s;tration but him&s;elf.</P>
<PB N="6" REF="5">
<P>But the chief De&s;ign of this Paper being an Account of the pre&s;ent Ma|nagement of the Victualling, I &s;hall relate it with all the Candor and Faith|fulne&s;s that becomes a Chri&s;tian and an Engli&s;hman, as in Duty I am bound by tho&s;e natural Ties and Obligations which lie upon me to the Service of my Country, and redre&s;&s;ing the Grievances of injur'd Seamen. In order to which I &s;hall con&s;ider how the King and Nation have been &s;erved in the Victu|alling, and what Provi&s;ion has been made for Seamen during the War.</P>
<P>You'l &s;ay perhaps it's no News to hear that the King and Nation are cheated, &s;ince we have had a continued Series of Villany in Publick Offices with Impunity. But from the Victualling we might expect better things, where not only Hone&s;ty, but Religion is pretended; yet the Godly are liable to Temptations, and an Ounce of Virtue is a precious Commodity among&s;t &s;ome &s;ort of People. A certain Per&s;on mu&s;t be a very hone&s;t Man, becau&s;e the Di&s;&s;enting Preachers about <HI>London</HI> vouch for his hone&s;ty; and as mighty Zealots as they were in the late Reigns for Liberty and Property, and again&s;t Courtiers in the Hou&s;e of Commons and Pen&s;ionary Parliaments, can now join with the Wicked to commit Iniquity, and &s;hove their heavy|ars'd Hearers to <HI>Guild Hall</HI> to vote for a Courtier, and give their recom|mendatory Epi&s;tles to the Church at <HI>Dover</HI> on behalf of the &s;age Politician the Son. But particular Reflections are &s;omewhat be&s;ides my purpo&s;e, and there|fore I &s;hall offer Ob&s;ervations on their Service to the Country in the Manage|ment of the Victualling.</P>
<P>Their Contracts with the Dealers to the Office have been the mo&s;t pre|po&s;terous of any thing in the World. <HI>Thomas Middleton</HI> a Hogman told me, he one year contracted with the Commi&s;&s;ioners for a number of Hogs, by which Contract he gained betwixt four and five thou&s;and Pounds: That the next year (as I remember) he made another Contract for a number of Hogs, by which Contract he was a lo&s;er, the Markets ri&s;ing higher than u&s;ual; at the end of the &s;ea&s;on when the whole Complement of Hogs were kill'd, he complain'd of his Lo&s;s to the Commi&s;&s;ioners, who made an Intere&s;t with the Lords of the Trea&s;ury, who in con&s;ideration of his lo&s;s gave 2500 <HI>l.</HI> out of the King's Pocket. Who would not enter into Contract with the King, who is willing to bear all the Lo&s;s and have no &s;hare of Profit? This <HI>Thomas Middleton</HI> being burdened with Riches, took an occa&s;ion to hang him&s;elf, and was &s;ucceeded in Contract by <HI>Henry Nunalee,</HI> who upon a Contract of Hogs lo&s;t 1500 <HI>l.</HI> He went the &s;ame way as <HI>Middleton</HI> had done; but <HI>Nunalce</HI> being a Williamite, and well affected to the Govern|ment, met with more Rubs and Ob&s;tacles than the other who was a pro|fe&s;s'd Jacobite: However after much attendance, and (I &s;uppo&s;e) paiment of a little Civility Mony, he got an allowance for the Lo&s;s. The Ca&s;e is
<PB N="7" REF="5">plain on the King's part, that he is a Lo&s;er by &s;uch a Contract; and as the Commi&s;&s;ioners cannot be ju&s;tified in &s;uch a Contract, &s;o the Rea&s;on of it on their part is very difficult to be found. For when they con|tracted with Mr. <HI>Nunalee</HI> for the Parcel of Hogs before-mentioned, Pork was at half a Crown a Stone in the Markets, a ri&s;ing Price too: It was no Ma&s;t Year, all manner of Hog Grain exce&s;&s;ive dear, the Sea&s;on &s;o far ad|vanced, that all the Town and Offal Hogs were kill'd and converted to Ba|con: however the Commi&s;&s;ioners, like good Husbands for the King, beat down the Price; and one wi&s;e Commi&s;&s;ioner &s;aid, that as he return'd out of the Country, he &s;aw a hundred Hogs in one Field, and thence rationally concluding there were the like number in every Field in <HI>England,</HI> they brought the Contract down to twenty &s;ix Shillings <HI>per</HI> hundred Weight. Now if there was any other meaning in this Contract, be&s;ides doing Di&s;|&s;ervice to the Nation, it mu&s;t be this, that at the end of the Sea&s;on, by putting the Hogman to petition the Trea&s;ury Board to have his Lo&s;s con&s;i|der'd, they &s;hould manife&s;t their wonderful Sagacity in biting off the Head of a poor Hogman.</P>
<P>Such Contracts are equally injurious to the Sailors as to the King; for the Contractor lo&s;ing Money every day, mu&s;t make the be&s;t of his Market, which is buying the wor&s;t Hogs; &s;o that very thin and ill &s;ed Pork, in all likelihood mu&s;t fill the wooden Platters aboard Ship, and the Sailors be fed with the Refu&s;e of the Markets, who as they do the be&s;t Service to the Nation, ought to have the be&s;t Provi&s;ions the Land can produce. Antient Cu&s;tom and common U&s;age in Offices are or ought to be as much ob&s;erved by Officers, as the Laws of a Realm by the Subject; for when old Cu&s;toms are broken in Offices, all things are put into confu&s;ion, and Men are at a lo&s;s how to apply them&s;elves. It has been an old and a rational Cu&s;tom in our Offices, and always in&s;erted in the In&s;tructions from the Admiralty to dependant Of|fices upon it, that no Per&s;on &s;hall deal, or be any way concerned in Trade in that Office wherein he receives Salary: But this has been &s;o far from the Practice of the Victualling, that &s;ome of the Commi&s;&s;ioners and Officers have dealt with the Office either in Shipping or otherwi&s;e. A great evil at|tends this Practice; for Officers paying them&s;elves, we can't imagine they'l put them&s;elves la&s;t upon the Li&s;t of Paiment; and &s;o other Warrants that are in Cour&s;e are po&s;tpon'd. And it has been ob&s;erv'd that no Office in <HI>Eng|land</HI> has broken the Cour&s;e of Paiment more than that of the Victualling: Be&s;ides, &s;ome of the Officers are common Buyers and Sellers of the Office Bills, and as con&s;tant Brokers upon the Exchange, as any that deal in Ex|chequer Notes, Bank Bills or Tallies.</P>
<PB N="8" REF="6">
<P>It is now become a Cu&s;tom (I believe throughout the whole Navy) for the Cathiers and Clerks to take Poundage of the Per&s;ons they pay Money to, contrary to antient Cu&s;tom, and all the Equity in the World. The Victual|ling for &s;ome time had a Banker in <HI>Lombard-&s;treet,</HI> who paid Money upon the King's Account, and took Poundage of the Per&s;ons he paid it to, as did their Agent at <HI>Port&s;mouth.</HI> This mu&s;t be either a very great Exaction upon the Parties dealing to the Office, or el&s;e an Allowance is made for it in the Price of the Commodity, which is a downright Abu&s;e to the Nation.</P>
<P>That the Nation has been cheated and abus'd more &s;ince the Revolution than under any other Government, is evident to any thinking man. The Mi&s;managements of the Victualling have been &s;o great, and the Office &s;o &s;candalous, that it has been even a national Nu&s;ance; and tho pro|&s;ecuted with reiterated Complaints at the Trea&s;ury and Parliament, all the hone&s;t Endeavours of Mankind have prov'd ineffectual: for where Men are Judges of their own Cau&s;e, no Ju&s;tice can be expected: You'l ne|ver hang a Highway-man more, if you allow him to be tried by his own Troop. About four years ago &s;ome hone&s;t Men in the Victualling had made a Di&s;covery of &s;everal Embezelments, of which they complained in divers Articles again&s;t the Officers embezelling the King's Stores. The&s;e Articles were delivered to one of the Commi&s;&s;ioners, and &s;o to another, but never examin'd into: All the puni&s;hment they inflicted on him was, that about a week after the Complaint, they gave him liberty for the Summer to re&s;ide at his Country Hou&s;e, and order'd the Officer that complain'd again&s;t him to do duty in his Room: This is much of the &s;ame nature of another Complaint again&s;t one of their Officers for drinking K. <HI>James</HI>'s Health, who in a Fort|night afterwards was advanced from a Place of forty Pounds <HI>per Ann.</HI> to a|bout three or four hundred. A Per&s;on of Honour hearing how the fore&s;aid Complaint was &s;tifled by the Commi&s;&s;ioners of the Victualling, got a Copy thereof, and gave it to the Lords of the Trea&s;ury, who after &s;ome time heard the Commi&s;&s;ioners <HI>ex parte</HI> again&s;t the King, and never examined one Witne&s;s on the King's part, to the proof of the matter of Fact alledged in the &s;aid Articles. So that hitherto it has been in vain to complain of Griev|ances, and the People of <HI>England</HI> have been forc'd to maintain by the &s;weat of their Brows, many that formerly betray'd their Liberties, and now en|rich them&s;elves out of the publick &s;poils of the Kingdom.</P>
<P>To recount all Mi&s;managements in this Office would fill a large Volume; the Ignorance and Negligence of the Per&s;ons concern'd in it, the profu&s;e wa&s;ting of the Nation's Stores, the contriving and forming Perqui&s;ites out of the &s;ame to them&s;elves, contrary to former Cu&s;tom and Practice; the &s;u|pernumerary Officers and Labourers in the Yards, old and decrepid, fitter for Ho&s;pitals than Service, are things notorious in the Eyes of all but &s;uch as &s;hould
<PB N="9" REF="6">puni&s;h them. Indeed &s;uch Men are well &s;ecured in ill Practices; they have their Brethren in other Offices to &s;tand by them, and a Power of di&s;charg|ing &s;uch of the Office as complain again&s;t them, as they did &s;everal of the poor men that complain'd again&s;t them in Parliament la&s;t year; nay one of the Commi&s;&s;ioners threatned to di&s;charge one of them in the Speaker's Cham|ber before the Committee.</P>
<P>Thus this Office has been managed in re&s;pect to the good of the Nation. It will not now be ami&s;s to con&s;ider how far this Management has affected the poor Sailors: An Engli&s;h man is not hard-hearted enough to reflect on the mi&s;erable Condition of our poor Sailors of Admiral <HI>Nevil</HI>'s Squadron in the <HI>We&s;t Indies.</HI> I am credibly inform'd from good hands, that out of that Squadron in a very &s;hort time we lo&s;t above 2500 men, who&s;e Lives I am &s;ure were of more value and concern to the Engli&s;h Nation, than all the Advantages of that Expedition, and the mighty Bu&s;ine&s;s of <HI>Cartagena</HI> our Gazette made &s;uch a noi&s;e about. A hot Country, &s;tinking Meat, and maggoty Bread, with the noi&s;om and poi&s;onous Scent of the Bilge Water, have made many a brave Engli&s;h Sailor food for Crabs and Sharks.</P>
<P>Now I am victualling abroad, &s;uffer me to take a view of the Navy in the <HI>Mediterranean,</HI> under the Command of Admiral <HI>Ru&s;&s;el:</HI> I &s;hall not touch too far upon this Head, the Affair being in better Hands, and under the con&s;ideration of wi&s;er-Heads; I mean before the Parliament. But as a Sailor, I mu&s;t needs &s;ay if &s;o large a Sum of Money as is talk'd of was impre&s;|ted to &s;ome body upon the account of Beverage, it is a damn'd &s;hame that our Fleet &s;hould be &s;o &s;candalous as it was there, and go by the name of the Vinegar Fleet, by rea&s;on of the &s;our Wine they drank: Be&s;ides, I remember it was a believ'd Report aboard our Ships, that the Spaniards were oblig'd by Articles to find Beverage and dry Provi&s;ions for the Engli&s;h Fleet; and we all concluded the va&s;t Sums of Money brought aboard the Fleet by the victu|alling Pinnace, had been upon that account: The Cock&s;wain and &s;ome of the Pinnace's Crew once told me how many Tun of Plate they brought a|board the Fleet; but that and a hundred Rogueries be&s;ide in that Fleet are out of my head at pre&s;ent: yet this I can a&s;&s;ure you, the Folk concerned in buy|ing the Beverage got very pretty E&s;tates out of it; and old non&s;en&s;ical <HI>Hum|phrey</HI> had &s;en&s;e enough to get, as we computed, at lea&s;t ten thou&s;and Pounds, when I am well &s;atisfied if the Lords of the Admiralty would have been graciou&s;ly plea&s;ed to have kept him at home, and given him twenty thou|&s;and Pounds for &s;o doing, it would have been more for the advantage of the Nation, and the Sailors Welfare: for we have abundance of men in publick Offices, that it would be for the advantage of the Country to give 'em twice the Salary to be without their Service. Thus has it far'd with the poor Sail|ors abroad.</P>
<PB N="10" REF="7">
<P>Now let us look into the Channel, and &s;ee how our Summer and Winter Guards of Shipping have been victualled. I thank God <HI>England</HI> is a very plentiful Country, and an hone&s;t Man that has money in his Pocket need not go with an empty Stomach; and I think the Parliaments have always made as ample Provi&s;ion for Victualling as may be; and yet during this War our Fleet has been put to &s;hort Allowance in the Channel, have had their guts pinch'd in view of the mo&s;t plentiful Country in the World, an unparallel'd and barbarous Action hitherto unknown. This is bad enough, but to be fed with &s;tinking Beef and Pork is much wor&s;e; and yet in the Year 91 or 92 the Victualling Office was turn'd into <HI>Pandora</HI>'s Box, and emitted as many Poi&s;ons to the de&s;truction of the poor Seamen, who were fed with rotten and &s;tinking Meat, as the Pur&s;ers Surveys, and the Books at the Victualling-Office at <HI>Dover</HI> will te&s;tifie. It was not the nature of the Climate made the&s;e Provi&s;ions &s;tink, this we are certain of, and as certain that it was done ei|ther out of a wilful De&s;ign again&s;t the Sailors, or out of profound Ignorance, both which are very dangerous.</P>
<P>It &s;eems as if <HI>England</HI> was &s;till to be perplex'd with a continued Series of ill Practices, and that the poor Sailors our chiefe&s;t Strength were to be abando|ned to all the Mi&s;eries of human Life, and as if every one that has a &s;uperin|tendency over them, by that Power had a Right to abu&s;e them: they learn one of the other to make earnings of them, and at the &s;ame time get Mony out of the King's Pocket and tho&s;e poor Creatures Bellies. Our Advices from Ad|miral <HI>Aylmer</HI>'s Squadron affirm their having Iri&s;h Beef in&s;tead of Engli&s;h: without doubt Engli&s;h Beef bears a good Price in tho&s;e Parts, and is a very Merchantable Commodity. It has always been contrary to the Cu&s;tom of the Navy to victual with any other Provi&s;ions than what are received from the King's Stores, as long as &s;uch Provi&s;ions &s;hall la&s;t: and the Pur&s;ers of Ships are obliged to furni&s;h the Ship with &s;uch Provi&s;ions as are &s;pecified in their &s;everal Indents, for which before they gave Security at the Navy Board. Indeed it may be allowable for the Pur&s;ers of Ships in foreign Parts, where they can afford it, to victual with fre&s;h Provi&s;ions, this change being not detrimental to the King but &s;erviceable to the Sailors overrun with the Scur|vy. And having before given Security for the Victualling of the Ship, in this Ca&s;e the Provi&s;ions have been adjudg'd to be their own, and they have been impowred to &s;ell them for their own Advantage, but not without the Com|mander's Warrant for &s;o doing; tho I have known the King's Provi&s;ions &s;old in the River of <HI>Thames,</HI> which, if there had been any left upon Return from a Voyage, ought to have been return'd into the King's Stores from whence they were fir&s;t i&s;&s;ued. The Commanders of Ships formerly had no|thing to do with the Ships Provi&s;ions, any further than to overlook and over|awe
<PB N="11" REF="7">the Pur&s;er, that none of them were converted any otherways than to the u&s;e of the Ship; but now it &s;eems the Commanders have u&s;urp'd a Power in this Ca&s;e, altogether detrimental to the Sailors: there is now as ill a Cu&s;tom brought up in the Navy for the Commanders to receive the Ships nece&s;&s;ary Money which always was the Pur&s;ers Charge, and for which they always indented with the Clerk of the I&s;&s;u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">s in the Victualling, being one Article among&s;t the &s;everal Species of Provi&s;ions &s;pecified in their Indent. But the Commanders being willing for their own Intere&s;t to have every thing in their own hands, have gain'd this Point upon the Pur&s;ers, not to their own di&s;ad|vantage. Now the Commander only having the Charge of the Ship, and giving no Security, being charg'd with nothing el&s;e, it's impracticable for him to receive the nece&s;&s;ary Money, the Pur&s;er having before given Se|curity for the &s;ame.</P>
<P>If there had not been &s;o great Care in the Victualling to get E&s;tates, there might have been more Care taken in getting good and whole&s;om Provi&s;ions for the Service of the Navy: but any thing is thought fit Food for Sailors, who being long accu&s;tomed to bad Diet, hardly know when they are ill us'd. But indeed the Care of the Victualling requires &s;omething of Brains; and as Times and Sea&s;ons alter, &s;o mu&s;t Methods too, for a common Road may lead a Man to the Place he intends to go, tho common Rea&s;on might direct him a nearer and perhaps a cleanlier way, if his Judgment was &s;utable to his Ne|ce&s;&s;ity. But Men of &s;mall Rea&s;on are often the greate&s;t Opiniat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">rs, and think the Exerci&s;e of their Talent outdoes all Mankind, when their Actions weigh'd in the Ballance of Rea&s;on are lighter than the lowe&s;t degree of vanity. I refer it to the Judgment of any rational Man whether the Method now us'd in the Victualling in di&s;&s;olving the Rock Salt into Pickle, and therewith pick|ling their Meat for Sea Service, be con&s;i&s;tent with Rea&s;on and the health of the Sailors: we know they are neither Conjurers nor Philo&s;ophers, yet a &s;mall degree of knowledg will tell a Man, that Pickle with all the ill qualities of Salt in it, can never be whole&s;om for human Bodies, which the Rock Salt mu&s;t of nece&s;&s;ity have before refining. The Bittern, the mo&s;t noxious Quality in Salt, is &s;eparated only by Precipitation; and this Quality joyn'd with a &s;ul|phurous Ar&s;enick in the Rock, and embodied with the moi&s;ture of the Meat, if it &s;uit the Victuallers Intere&s;t, it can never agree with the Welfare of the Sailor. Mr. <HI>Collins</HI> in his Di&s;cour&s;e of Salt, <HI>p.</HI> 55. &s;peaking of its vicious Ef|fects, &s;ays as to Fle&s;h, <HI>Be&s;ides in general a bad Ta&s;te, or a good Reli&s;h de|&s;troy'd, the Moi&s;ture, Gravy, and Nouri&s;hment in a little time is rendred as &s;alt as Salt it &s;elf. Hence the Fle&s;h becomes hard, afterwards very bad or unfit for Food, and at length is mortified or rotten.</HI> He further adds as to the Con&s;equences of u&s;ing it: <HI>It cau&s;es Scurvies, Con&s;umptions, and other
<PB N="12" REF="8">Acrimonious Di&s;ea&s;es in the Bodies of Seamen, or Soldiers in a be&s;ieged Gari|&s;on, that are compell'd to the frequent and long u&s;e of it.</HI> Nay it is of &s;o vio|lent and corroding a Nature, that the Honourable <HI>Robert Boyl</HI> E&s;q; has &s;o pre|par'd it, as to make it di&s;&s;olve Iron Bars: but perhaps the Victualler thinks the Sailors Bodies more durable than Iron, and becau&s;e their Patience cannot be worn out, their Guts can't neither. There's no great danger that any Body will follow this fooli&s;h Example; however herein they have manife&s;ted their kindne&s;s to the King and Country in u&s;ing a Method that le&s;&s;ens the Duty upon Salt, con&s;idering how many Weigh of Salt is us'd in Pickle in one Year: and it is very un&s;eemly that a Project de&s;tructive of a publick Fund, &s;hould com|mence at the King's own Hou&s;e as an Example to the Subject; but the whole Management of the Navy is of a piece. The <HI>Simeon</HI>'s and <HI>Levi</HI>'s, tho of dif|ferent Tribes, are embarked in the &s;ame Cau&s;e, pur&s;ue the &s;ame Ends, and are alike odious in the eyes of the People.</P>
<P>But the mi&s;managements of this Office and of the Navy, proceed from the Admiralty, as filthy Springs from an impure Fountain, the&s;e being but branches of that cur&s;ed Tree, that has yielded the Nation &s;uch &s;owr fruit, as to &s;et all our Sailors teeth on edg: an Office manag'd we know not how, nor to what purpo&s;e; for I dare engage to pick out as many old Women in <HI>Wapping,</HI> that &s;hould have manag'd that Affair more for the Honour, Glo|ry and Advantage of the Engli&s;h Nation. The Queen of <HI>Sheba</HI> when &s;he gave her Vi&s;it to <HI>Solomon,</HI> extol'd his Wi&s;dom and his Servants: our <HI>Solo|mon</HI> is indeed worthy of Honour, who has been the Care of Heaven, as the&s;e Nations have been his; and the Queen of <HI>Sheba</HI> might ju&s;tly have done him the &s;ame Honour could &s;he have come hither: yet I engage &s;he would have left out the latter part of her Compliment, and took little notice of the <HI>Sitting of his Servants</HI> in the Admiralty, of their Virtue or Wi&s;dom: She takes no no|tice of <HI>Solomon</HI>'s nor <HI>Hiram's</HI> Navy, yet the Scripture tells us they were un|der the Conduct <HI>of Ship-Men that had knowledg of the Sea;</HI> and in another place, that part of their Loading was Apes and Peacocks, but tells us no where that Apes or Peacocks had the Sovereign Command in Sea Affairs, or that Land men were proper Per&s;ons to command Men of War. It is a great Misfortune to a Prince to fall into the hands of Sycophants and Flatterers, who magnifie their own de&s;erts to the Ruin of the Nation, get about him &s;o clo&s;e that his be&s;t Subjects can't &s;ee him; and if he be unfairly dealt with they know nothing of it, neither how to commi&s;erate his Condition, nor give him that A&s;&s;i&s;tance as is nece&s;&s;ary to his pre&s;ervation: &s;uch a Prince is per|fectly hoodwink'd like a Hawk, and tho&s;e that hold him will not let him fly, but at &s;ome profitable Quarry for their own Advantage; they never &s;uf|fer him to hear what others can &s;ay, le&s;t they &s;hould &s;peak &s;omething to their
<PB N="13" REF="8">own Prejudice. And thus the Prince by adhering to and promoting the Inte|re&s;t of a few, lo&s;es the Love of many, which often proves fatal both to him|&s;elf and People. A Good Prince di&s;pen&s;es his Favours as the Sun does its Beams by a univer&s;al Reflection upon Plants of all &s;orts, but the more gene|rous Plants receive mo&s;t of the kindly Influence of its Rays. Mercy is a com|mendable thing in a Prince, it may drop upon Criminals, but Favours ought not to pour down upon them. I would not de&s;troy the whole Species of Vi|pers becau&s;e they are part of the Creation, and manife&s;t the Wi&s;dom of the great Former of all things; but there is no nece&s;&s;ity for me to fo&s;ter them in my Bo&s;om, and expo&s;e my Body to their Poi&s;on. If the Managers of the Admiralty de&s;erve the Po&s;ts they occupy, it is more than the People know, and the Merchants of <HI>England</HI> will tell lamentable Stories to the contrary. Some of them perhaps have de&s;erv'd well of their Country, however not in the Ad|miralty: for a Per&s;on prefer'd to an Office he knows nothing of, by his Igno|rance in one day may do more di&s;&s;ervice to his Country, than all the former Services of his Life will amount to. The wi&s;e&s;t Men in <HI>England</HI> have em|ploy'd their Brains to no purpo&s;e, to unriddle the meaning of &s;uch Prefer|ments; the old Maxim of preferring Enemies and di&s;obliging Friends has been exploded by all Men of Sen&s;e: but the Court Party have now another Maxim, that all Commonwealths Men are Enemies to Monarchy, and not to be tru&s;ted; and all Engli&s;hmen and Lovers of the Liberties of their Country they repre&s;ent as &s;uch, while the contrary get the be&s;t Places of Profit and Tru&s;t in the Kingdom. Now I would fain know how this Government comes to be a Monarchy in their Sen&s;e, and whether any Commonwealths|man in <HI>England</HI> can de&s;ire a Government more &s;utable to the common Good, and conform to his own Principles, if it be faithfully admini&s;tr'd according to its Con&s;titution. For no Man of a Republican Principle can de&s;ire more than to have Kings accountable to the People for Male-Admini&s;tration, and by their forefaulting to make a Forfeiture of the Regal Dignity wherewith they are ve&s;ted; by which Forfeiture all the Right of Governing devolves again up|on the People, who of their own free Will and undoubted Right and Power proceed to a New Election, and place one more Righteous than the former up|on the Throne if they think fit, upon which Foundation this Government is built. So that Commonwealth&s;men, as the Courtiers call them, mu&s;t be the be&s;t Friends of this Government, becau&s;e they are for &s;ecuring the Foundation of it, and not for rai&s;ing a Super&s;tructure to make it top-heavy and tumble down. Ill and corrupt Officers and Mini&s;ters are the greate&s;t Enemies to Monarchy in the World: for when the People &s;ee under all Kings ill Men in Of|fices, the Wealth of the Nation profu&s;ely lavi&s;h'd, and the Liberties of the People in continual danger, they'l conclude that Mi&s;managements are acci|dents
<PB N="14" REF="9">in&s;eparable from Monarchy, that the Fault is not in the King but in the Office, and let 'em change the Per&s;on never &s;o often, the thing will be the &s;ame; and &s;o begin to think of another form of Government.</P>
<P>There has been &s;uch an uninterrupted Progre&s;s of Mi&s;managements in our Naval Affairs, through the Conduct of the Per&s;ons concerned in the Ma|nagery, that nothing hitherto has been our pre&s;ervation, but the immedi|ate hand of Providence: The Walls of our I&s;land are our Shipping; tho&s;e once broken down, we are laid open to the violent In&s;ults of any Enemy: A little Retro&s;pection now would do very well, and not only &s;o, but we ought to look forward, and find out ways and means to prevent the like for the future.</P>
<P>It is the Bu&s;ine&s;s of our Repre&s;entatives in Parliament to enquire into things of this Nature; they are the Guardians of our Liberties, and are bound to redre&s;s the Grievances of the People, by virtue of who&s;e electing Power they have a Right to &s;it in the Hou&s;e of Commons and enact Laws: They have no Power from the People they repre&s;ent to make Laws de&s;tructive of their Property, or dimini&s;hing of their Wealth, upon groundle&s;s Occa|&s;ions; nor ought they to give Relea&s;es to &s;uch as have &s;quander'd away the Wealth of the Kingdom, and betray'd the Liberty of the Subject. He that dos not prevent a Mi&s;chief when it lies in his power &s;o to do, is equally guilty with the hand that did it, and equally accountable to God Almighty. It is much more now the Bu&s;ine&s;s of Parliaments, &s;ince there is no way el&s;e to bring Criminals to Ju&s;tice; and the greate&s;t Ju&s;tice that ever was done in Ca&s;es of this nature has been done by Parliaments, of which I could give many In&s;tances had I time or place. Making publick Examples of &s;uch Criminals is not only a Debt we owe to publick Ju&s;tice, and the common good of the Realm, but will be a Terror to all future Offenders in Ca&s;es of the like Nature: for if &s;uch Abu&s;es are tolerated too long, they'l become fa&s;hionable, and a Man mu&s;t turn a Rogue to get into an Em|ploiment. 'Tis well for the Engli&s;h Nation the&s;e Mi&s;creants are not beyond the Reach of Parliament, who&s;e Authority and Prerogative if once lo&s;t we may bid an eternal Farewel to our Native Liberty; and indeed the le&s;&s;ening of the Power of Parliaments has not a little been aim'd at by &s;ome within the&s;e few years, who would have us believe the Bu&s;ine&s;s of the Commons is only to a&s;&s;emble one year in St. <HI>Stephen</HI>'s Chappel to rai&s;e Mony for them to &s;quander it away the next; I wonder all this while they have not had the Impudence to attempt the rai&s;ing of Mony without Act of Parliament, that being as legal as the converting appropriated Funds to other u&s;es than &s;uch as are &s;pecify'd in the Act. But the day of Judgment we hope is at hand, when the Wi&s;dom and &s;upream Authority of the People &s;hall avenge the Injuries done to the Engli&s;h Nation upon the Criminals.</P>
<PB N="15" REF="9">
<P>To look forward is as much our Intere&s;t; and no le&s;s the indi&s;pen&s;ible Duty of our Repre&s;entatives in Parliament to take care of the &s;afety of the Nation in the well management of the Fleet. His Maje&s;ty in his mo&s;t Gracious Speech upon disbanding the Army, lays the &s;afety of the Nation before them, <HI>as a Duty incumbent on them;</HI> and &s;ince the Army is disband|ed, our main &s;afety is our Shipping. This Security &s;uppo&s;ed, was, I believe, the chief rea&s;on of laying the Land Forces a&s;ide; &s;o that now the be&s;t Se|curity we have left is our Shipping, and a good and &s;ufficient Security too under a good Management. The Nation has already felt the Effects of the pre&s;ent Management; and to let the Nation &s;uffer any longer upon this Ac|count may bring us under &s;uch ill Circum&s;tances, that will put it out of the Power of Parliaments to recover us from ruin. The Admiralty has been in the hands of &s;uch Men too long already, and 'tis now more dangerous than ever to repo&s;e a Tru&s;t of &s;o high a Nature, of &s;uch great Con&s;equence to the Nation, in their hands; we know very well what Party it was in&s;i&s;t|ed &s;o much upon the Nece&s;&s;ity of a Land Force: and to tru&s;t the Navy in &s;uch hands for the future, as already it has been of ill Con&s;equence, &s;o it may prove more dangerous; they may &s;o far embara&s;s the Naval Affairs, retard the Enterprizes of the Navy, by ordering Squadrons and Cruizers in &s;uch Stations where they cannot be &s;erviceable: &s;o that in a little time the Navy doing no &s;ervice, &s;hall be thought altogether u&s;ele&s;s, and this &s;hall be made an Argument for the nece&s;&s;ity of a Land Army. I wi&s;h the Mi&s;carriages of the Navy already have not been out of de&s;ign for this Purpo&s;e: If the&s;e Grievances continue, the Commons may at la&s;t be forc'd to prevent &s;uch Mi&s;chiefs for the future by taking the Charge and Ma|nagement of the Navy and dependant Offices into their own hands, by appointing Commi&s;&s;ioners of their own: and this &s;eems rational enough for tho&s;e that are at the Charge, to &s;uperintend the Management of the Affair; nor is this a new thing and unprecedented. 31 <HI>Hen.</HI> 6. <HI>Richard</HI> Earl of <HI>Salisbury, John</HI> Earl of <HI>Shrewsbury, John</HI> Earl of <HI>Worce&s;ter, James</HI> Earl of <HI>Wilt&s;hire,</HI> and the Lord <HI>Sturton were appointed by Parliament to keep the Seas;</HI> and the Tunnage and Poundage were appointed for defraying the Charge thereof. 8 <HI>Hen.</HI> 4. The Merchants were empowered to name two Per&s;ons, the one for the South, the other for the North, <HI>who by Com|mi&s;&s;ion had the like Power as other Admirals had.</HI> So that you &s;ee the Charge of the Navy has been a Parliamentary Care in times le&s;s dangerous than now; and tho&s;e who are appointed Commi&s;&s;ioners in this Affair will be more care|ful in the di&s;charge of the Tru&s;t repo&s;ed in them, nor will they have &s;o ma|ny ways to &s;lip their Necks out of the Collar as now: Here will be no Pri|vy Seal to impre&s;t Money for unknown Services, no pa&s;&s;ing of Accounts
<PB N="16" REF="10">without Vouchers, no abu&s;e of Sailors in Wages or Provi&s;ions; the King|dom will be kept in a good Po&s;ture of Defence; the Minds of the People will be ea&s;y when the Management of their Navy is in the hands of Com|mi&s;&s;ioners of their own, alike intere&s;ted in the Good and Security of the Realm; and our Enemies more terrified, when the Bu&s;ine&s;s of the Navy is the Care of the whole Kingdom. All which is &s;ubmitted to the Wi&s;dom of our Re|pre&s;entatives in Parliament, before whom the Ca&s;e lies at this Juncture.</P>
