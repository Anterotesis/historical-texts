<HEAD>A true RELATION Of what pa&s;t betweene the Fleet of his Highnes the Prince of Wales, and that under the Command of the Earle of Warwick.</HEAD>
<P>_VNder&s;tandinge that there are divers reports and untruthes vented concerninge his High|nes the Prince of Wales goeinge up into the River of Th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">mes, I have thought good as being an eye wittne&s;&s;e of all the proceedings to &s;et forth the truth with out any partiality.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="26" UNIT="August"> Augu&s;t it was re&s;olved by his Highne&s;&s;e Coun|cell in the Downes in regard of the &s;hortne&s;&s;e of provi&s;ions, e&s;pecialy beare, to goe for Holl|and to new victuall, to which purpo&s;e the Fleet wayinge that day &s;tood for the North forland, where we mett with one of our &s;mall ve&s;&s;ells who had binn abroad for intelligence, who tould us the Earle of Warwick was coming
<PB N="2" REF="3">downe as low as the boy of the Red&s;and, where|upon we pre&s;ently &s;tood back for Marget Road hopeinge that night or next morning to have mett with him.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="27" UNIT="August"> Hearing noe newes of him we wayed &amp; &s;tood towards the coa&s;t of Holland, but the &s;eamen would by noe meanes be per&s;waded, but would be contented with halfe allowance or le&s;&s;e, &s;oe that they might goe into the River of Thames, to meet with the &s;aid Earle.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="28" UNIT="August"> Whereupon the 28th. in the morning we way|ed and &s;tood for the longe &s;and head, and Anc|kored there that night.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="29" UNIT="August"> We wayed and &s;tood up into the River the wind then at South Ea&s;t, and when we were within a League of the Spitts &s;aw the Earle of Warwick, and all his Fleet, about 3 a clock the headmo&s;t of his Ships fireing &s;ome gunnes to give warneing to his Fleet when they &s;aw us, who pre&s;ently &s;tood back in to the River againe we followeing them, and that night they gott up as high as the cant and there Anckered, we could not fetch neare them by 3 miles but &s;em a Ketch to him, with a &s;ummons from the
<PB N="3" REF="3">Prince, of which we receaved an&s;weare about 12 a clock at night.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="August"> We wayed with the Flood, the wind We&s;terly and plyed towards him, he then likewi&s;e wayed and &s;till plied up into the River, and was gott open of the mouth of the River of med way by which tyme the van of our Fleet were gott near him and ready to ingage, at which tyme a &s;ud|aine gu&s;t, came at North We&s;t, with much vic|lence that we were both Fleets forced to chapp to an anckor &s;udainly, one of his Frigatts &s;pend|inge his maine Topma&s;t or rather the head of his mayne Ma&s;t, &amp; in truth this &s;udaine &s;torme did demon&s;trate to us that God was unwillinge to have any bloud &s;pilt. <MILESTONE N="31" UNIT="August"> Rideing thus at an anckor all that evening and night till next day 11 a clock the wind &s;till continueing betweene the North We&s;t, and We&s;t North We&s;t, and we within amile of each other, but &s;till a hard gale of wind. The Prince perceaveing he could noe wi&s;e ingage them. About 9 of the clock &s;hot of a warning peice and loo&s;ed the fore Top&s;aile not waighinge in two howers after, and vvhen he waighed left the Vi&s;eadmirall Rearadmirall and Convertine to bringe up the reare. The
<PB N="4" REF="4">Prince with the Fleet &s;tanding avvay, with his Top&s;aile downe on the chapp to go for Holland and indeed it was high tyme, there being not in the Ships more then a butt of beare &amp; no vvater.</P>
<P>After we had &s;tood away from him two lea|gues, he waighed with his Fleet as if he would have done &s;omething, and &s;tood after us with all his &s;ayles, we &s;till makeing noe more &s;ayle, and as he or any of his Fleet came neare to us, we &s;tayinge for them they would doe the like and off the Spitts all his Fleet came by the lee night in hand we &s;tanding away our cour&s;e for Holland with lights upon the Admiralls poope. <MILESTONE N="1" UNIT="September"> Septemb: About 11 of the clock &s;aw Goree Church and in the afternoone landed his Hyghne&s;&s;e in one of the &s;mall Frigatts, all the Fleet getting in but the Admirall and two more.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="2" UNIT="September"> The other two Ships gott in but the Admirall could not.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="3" UNIT="September"> The wind at North We&s;t, the Admirall could not waigh, and being without any drinck 24 howers cut Cable and rann into Hellivoot&s;lui&s;e.</P>
<P>Thus have I given a true and impartiall rela|tion of the whole bu&s;ine&s;&s;e to &s;topp the mout|hes of all tho&s;e who report the Prince fled from
<PB N="5" REF="4">the Earle of Warvvick, for I mu&s;t doe his High|ne&s;&s;e that right that I never &s;aw a man more ready and willinge to engage his owne per&s;on, then he was; for when S^r William Batten and others came to him, de&s;ir<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ing him to goe down his an&s;vvere was, he would never agree to it, it being not for his honour, &s;o that a re&s;olution vvas taken if they came to ingage to have car|ied him dovvne by force.</P>
<P>And novv though I have done vvith the re|lation, yet I mu&s;t &s;ay &s;omethinge in vindication of the judgements of the &s;ea commanders under vvho&s;e &s;pheare it vvill mo&s;t properly fall.</P>
<P>I knovv it vvil be obiected and that ju&s;tly to, unle&s;&s;e cleared a great deale of undi&s;cretion in this bu&s;ine&s;&s;e.</P>
<P>As fir&s;t the coming into the River vvith &s;oe &s;mall a proportion of victualls, and &s;econdly, to offer to ingage &s;uch Schips in &s;oe narrovv a &s;traight and &s;oe much di&s;advantage on the Princes &s;ide.</P>
<P>To both vvhich I an&s;vvear it was quite again&s;t the &s;ence of the councell, but occationed by the re&s;olutions I vvill not &s;ay di&s;cretion of the &s;ea|men, for in all me life I never &s;avv men more ready &amp; unanimous to engage then they vvere.</P>
