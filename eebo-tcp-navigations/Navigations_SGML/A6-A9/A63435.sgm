<P>_BY the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of God Almighty we have obtained ye|&s;terday a great and glorious Victory over our Enemy, as your Lord&s;hip may plainely &s;ee in this following Re|lation. His Excellence the Lord Generall <HI>Leonard Tor|&s;ten&s;ohn,</HI> after that he had left the Countrey of <HI>Sile&s;ia,</HI> turned with his Army toward the River of <HI>Elve,</HI> and the 16/26 of <HI>Octo|ber,</HI> pa&s;&s;ed over the &s;aid River, and tooke his Quarter at <HI>Eylenburg:</HI> Being now the Enemy followed with his whole Army, wherefore his Excellencie &s;ent for me to come unto him to <HI>Eylenburg</HI> with my Forces, which I pre&s;ently put in execution, and joyned with him the 20.30. of <HI>October.</HI> The &s;ame day by the fierce &s;hooting with our Canons, a great peece of the City wall neare the Cloy&s;ter of Saint <HI>Paul</HI> was battered downe, whereupon al&s;o pre&s;ently an a&s;&s;ault was given, but without effect, becau&s;e the breach that was &s;hot, was too high in the wall, and in the a&s;&s;ault we lo&s;t about a hundred &s;oul|diers, and &s;ome officers. The Imperiali&s;ts, which could plainely
<PB N="2" REF="2">heare the roaring of our Canons, tooke occa&s;ion to &s;uccour and re|lieve the City, and to &s;et forward their March, advanced the 21. of <HI>October</HI> within halfe a <HI>Dutch</HI> mile neare unto our Army, and &s;tood all that night in Battalia. Whereupon his Excellencie the Lord Ge|nerall <HI>Tor&s;ten&s;ohn</HI> went with his whole Cavallery to meete the Im|periali&s;ts by the way to hinder all inconveniences and a&s;&s;aults, or to give him&s;elfe an a&s;&s;ault upon the Imperiall Army, yet the &s;ame night nothing pa&s;&s;ed betwixt both Armies. The 22. of <HI>October</HI> earely be|fore day-light his Excellencie came backe with the Cavallery draw|ing together the Infantry and Baggage, and thus appeared before his Enemies face, who pre&s;ented him&s;elfe no le&s;&s;e, onely the pa&s;&s;age was &s;omewhat inconvenient and trouble&s;ome unto us, and we enter|tained but &s;mall skirmi&s;hes with the <HI>Hungarians</HI> and <HI>Croats,</HI> wherfore his Excellencie marched over the pa&s;&s;age directly into the Enemies face, but that day nothing was done of any con&s;equence. The &s;ame night to hinder and prevent all a&s;&s;aults, we made divers fal&s;e Alarums to the Enemy, and &s;tood all night long with our Army in Battalia, till the cleare Sun-&s;hine broke forth, being Sunday the 23. of <HI>Octo|ber,</HI> and the day was &s;o cleare, that both we and the Enemy had a great minde to fight, and to give him herein content and &s;atisfacti|on, after that we had devoutly called upon God Almighty for his a&s;&s;i&s;tance, we tooke the worke in hand with a good re&s;olution; and after that both Armies were come to a &s;tand upon the &s;ame place, where a 11 years agoe the King of <HI>Sweden, Gu&s;t. Adolphus</HI> of glorious memory, obtained the great victory again&s;t the Imperiall Generall <HI>Tilly</HI> (which is worthy ob&s;erving) we fell in Gods name upon the Enemy, and on both &s;ides there was fought &s;o furiou&s;ly and &s;toutly, that it was wonderfull to &s;ee how the Regiments &s;tood one again&s;t the other, and none would yeeld in the lea&s;t way to each other, til at la&s;t the Enemies Left-wing flew a little off, and prepared for a flight, but they were pre&s;ently brought againe to a &s;tand: In the a&s;&s;aulting of the Enemies right Wing we had &s;o good &s;ucce&s;&s;e, that after three hours valiant fight the &s;ame was forced <HI>nolens volens</HI> to leave the field, and to ki&s;&s;e with their heads the ground. The Enemies left Wing was pur&s;ued by his Excellencie as farre as <HI>Leipzigk,</HI> and the right Wing by my Troups as farre as <HI>Eylenburg,</HI> tho&s;e that were o|vertaken in the cha&s;e and pur&s;uite, were dealt withall according to the cu&s;tome of Warre, and put to the &s;word. For this Victory open thank&s;givings were made unto God Almighty by our whole Army. The Enemies Army be&s;ides the <HI>Hungarians</HI> and <HI>Croats,</HI> con&s;i&s;ted of
<PB N="3" REF="2">&s;ixty &s;trong Squadrons of hor&s;e, and eleven Brigads of foot, among&s;t which were foure <HI>Saxon</HI> Regiments of hor&s;e, and of the Electours owne commanded Troupes, two Regiments of hor&s;e more, one Re|giment of Dragooners, and five hundred Mu&s;queteers. The Ene|mies Infantry is totally fallen into our hands, in&s;omuch that few or none thereof e&s;caped; which craving Quarter upon their knees, were &s;pared and &s;aved alive. In the beginning of the Battell our In|fantery had likewi&s;e &s;ome con&s;iderable lo&s;&s;e: among&s;t the Pri&s;oners we tooke, is the Generall of the Artillery Count of <HI>Soye,</HI> together with divers other Commanders and Officers, and many great Com|manders al&s;o were &s;laine upon the place; of the Pri&s;oners we have as yet no Li&s;t: On our &s;ide we had likewi&s;e a con&s;iderable lo&s;&s;e, be|cau&s;e many brave Commanders and Officers were &s;laine upon the place, for the lo&s;&s;e whereof we are &s;orry, e&s;pecially for Generall Ma|jor <HI>Lilly Hoeck,</HI> Generall Major <HI>Slangh,</HI> Colonell <HI>Shliebe,</HI> the young <HI>Bannier, Bibo,</HI> and others, Generall Major <HI>Stollhans</HI> was wounded, but not dangerou&s;ly. The Enemies whole Artillery con&s;i&s;ting of forty eight peeces of Ordnance, together with all their furniture, is fallen into our hands; as al&s;o all their Colours and many Stan|dards, which are about in our Campe for a triumph in the &s;ight of the people: the Enemies Cavallery &s;uffered likewi&s;e very much. On our &s;ide we had the word, <HI>Helpe Lord Je&s;u,</HI> who hath likewi&s;e beene our helper; the Enemies word was <HI>Sancta Maria.</HI> In great ha&s;te the 24. of <HI>October,</HI> the third of <HI>November</HI> 1642.</P>
<P>In the beginning of the fight his Exellencies hor&s;e was killed with a &s;hot under him, which Bullet hit afterwards Colonell <HI>Grube,</HI> that he died pre&s;ently, <HI>Leipzigk</HI> mu&s;t now &s;tand to our mercie.</P>

<P>THe <HI>Swedi&s;h</HI> Field Mar&s;hall <HI>Tor&s;ten&s;ohn,</HI> having left <HI>Sile&s;ia,</HI> with his maine Army tooke his March towards <HI>Ilenbergh</HI> which he pa&s;t the 16. The Enemy following him with his whole Army, His Excellency called <HI>Kennexmarke</HI> to joyne with him, which was effected the 20. day. On which day <HI>Leipzigk</HI> had a great part of the wall beaten downe by the Cannon; whereupon at full day an a&s;|&s;ault was given, but without effect; the wall being yet too high, and they lo&s;t about a 100. Souldiers be&s;ides Commanders.</P>
<P>Now the Enemy having heard the Cannon play, tooke hereby an occa&s;ion to rai&s;e the &s;iege and to march on towards <HI>Leipzigke,</HI> advancing towards us upon the 21. day, within halfe a mile of us, and there &s;tood in battaile Array all night; our Field Mar&s;hall going to meete him with all the Cavallery, either to prevent their on&s;et,
<PB N="7" REF="4">or to fall upon his Campe, yet nothing was attempted that night.</P>
<P>Now on the 22. day, His Excellency retreated againe with the Cavallery, drawing the Infantry and Baggage nearer unto him, and cau&s;ed the &s;ame to march before, &s;tanding him&s;elfe with the In|fantry and Artillery, in a well formed Battalia in &s;ight of the Ene|my, who did &s;hew him&s;elfe in like po&s;ture, but by rea&s;on of the &s;traite pa&s;&s;age, nothing could be done on either &s;ide, be&s;ides &s;ome skirmi&s;hing with the <HI>Hungarians,</HI> and <HI>Croatians;</HI> Whereupon his Excellency to make place for the Enemy to come over the pa&s;&s;age, retired further backward with his Army, which the Enemy percei|ving, followed on, and thus that day was &s;pent. In the night time we had &s;everall blind Allarmes given from the Enemy, whereupon to prevent all danger, our whole Army &s;tood in a good po&s;ture un|till the next morning, which was Sunday the 23. day, when the Enemy &s;hewed as much de&s;ire and courage to &s;ight, as we had to &s;a|tisfie him therein. Every one (earne&s;tly calling upon God) made him&s;elfe fit and ready to fight with a good re&s;olution. And after both Armies were ju&s;t met in the very &s;ame place where 11. yeares agoe the Battaile of <HI>Leipzigk</HI> was fought (which was very omi|nous and ob&s;ervable) we &s;et (in the name of God) upon the Ene|my, and had &s;uch a furious and re&s;olute encounter as it was a won|der to behold how that neither party would yeeld to the other, un|till at la&s;t the left wing of the Enemy was routed by maine force, and our left wing likewi&s;e &s;uffered &s;omewhat, yet was &s;oone reco|vered and brought to right. In the &s;econd encounter it went very well on our &s;ide, and altogether as ill on the enemies, &s;o that (after three houres &s;tout and couragious fight) he was compelled <HI>nolens volens</HI> to quit the Field, and to betake him&s;elfe to flight; His left wing was pur&s;ued by his Excellency farre on this &s;ide <HI>Leipzigk,</HI> but the right wing by Generall <HI>Coning&s;marke</HI> with his Troopes almo&s;t to <HI>Elinbergh</HI> neare a dayes journey.</P>
<P>What&s;oever was overtaken was &s;erved according to the cour&s;e of Warre.
