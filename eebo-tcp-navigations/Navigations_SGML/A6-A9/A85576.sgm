<HEAD>Two great and de&s;perate Engagements, both by Sea and Land: the fir&s;t be|tween the Engli&s;h frigats, commanded by Cap. Fo&s;ter Cap. Benjamin, and Ca. George Cracknel, and the K. of Scots men of War, commanded by Vice-ad|miral Banni&s;ter. &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>_ON the 8 of this in&s;tant July, 1654. divers of the Engli&s;h Frigats having been upon the Coa&s;t of Dunkirk, to convoy a fleet of Merchant-men; upon their return to|wards the Narrow, they e&s;pyed the King of Scots fleet, unto whom they gave chace; and at la&s;t com|within &s;hot, &s;aluted them with &s;everal broad &s;ides; Vice-admiral Banni&s;ter being in the Eagle, an&s;werd them again; but after a &s;harp di&s;pute, finding the
<PB N="4" REF="3">Arguments too high to di&s;pen&s;e withall from the mouthe of the Engli&s;h Canon, he tacked about, for Calis, and got under the command of the Roy|all Fort, where he pre&s;ently hung forth a Flag of defiance; which Captain Benjamin Sa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">heverel per|ceiving, attempted with the Eagle to &s;trand him; but the great Canon from the Fort and Blockhou|&s;es played &s;o a&s;t upon him, that he was con&s;trained to come off by the Leeward, his de&s;ign proving unfea&s;ible. However upon their putting forth to the main Ocean, they e&s;pyed another fleet, which proved French-men, and after 4 or 5 leagues chace, &s;ank one, and took another, without the lo&s;s of one man. We have al&s;o taken their Newfound land fleet, and divers &s;hips coming from Malaga, which adds far more Tryumphant Victories, when we fought the Royal Navy took their Admiral, and di|vers others, and totally di&s;&s;ipated the whole Fleet; which heroick Atchievment, de&s;erves to be eter|niz'd, with the&s;e Lines, in Letters of Gold.</P>

<P>From <HI>Scotland</HI> further thus: The Mini&s;ters &s;till preach up young Charles their King, and pray for him as <HI>Gods Vice ge|rent</HI> on earth. Their forces are endeavouring a conjunction, and the North Countrey are generally di&s;affected, murthering the Engli&s;h privately; but a party coming from Ayr, commanded by Quarterma&s;ter Steven&s;on, being pur&s;ued by a &s;trong party of the enemy, faced about, drew up and ingaged them; and after a very &s;harp and de&s;perate di&s;pute, took one Captain, a Cornet, and 11

<P>But that which appeares more dreadful unto us, is, the enemies falling upon the a|fore&s;aid Col.
