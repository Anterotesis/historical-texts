<P><HI>_THat whereas the Trade of the</HI> Ea&s;t-Indies <HI>was begum now 54. yeares pa&s;t, and hath been continued ever &s;ince by a Company, and managed by Merchants, and other Citizens of</HI> London, <HI>for &s;ome yeares by Voyages, which di&s;covering every day new Trades, pro|ving profitable, both to the Adventurers, and Nation in generall, gave encouragement to all degrees of People, to &s;ub&s;cribe a large Joynt Stock of above 1500 thou&s;and pounds, which for &s;ome yeares pro&s;pered, untill after di&s;|covery and &s;etting a factory in</HI> Surrat, <HI>the trade of Silk of</HI> Per&s;ia <HI>came known to us, and proved of very great con|&s;equence, as to the expence of much broad cloath and other Manufactures of</HI> England, <HI>as al&s;o of many other of</HI> In|dia, <HI>(whereof the</HI> Portingalls, <HI>had then the whole trade to</HI>
<PB REF="4"> <HI>them&s;elves) which our</HI> Turkey Merchants <HI>envying more e&s;pecially this of the &s;ilke of</HI> Per&s;ia, <HI>as fearing, that if the trade of</HI> India <HI>did thrive, and grow rich, it would bring all, or the greater part of the Silk of</HI> Per&s;ia, <HI>by way of</HI> India, <HI>became therefore adventurers in the &s;ame &s;tock: And the better to &s;trengthen their party, and get the ma|naging of the whole action unto them&s;elves by electing Al|dermen, and other rich</HI> Merchants <HI>Governours, Deputies, and commitees of their own &s;ociety, they carried all things to their own minds, even to the raining of four joynt &s;tocks and as many, or more voyages by their wilfull neglects, im|provident cour&s;es, and ill managed actions, As your High|ne&s;s will perceive by the following Remon&s;trance, wherein I have not only repre&s;ented the &s;aid Companies errors, but al&s;o &s;hewed your Highne&s;s how tho&s;e might have bin, &amp; yet may be (if rightly manged made mo&s;t rich, and profitable trades to this Nation, adding thereunto &s;ome of the mo&s;t notorious wrongs, and injuries, the Dutch have perpetra|ted upon the per&s;ons, &s;hips and goods of our people in</HI> India, <HI>to the lo&s;se of &s;ome Millions of pounds for many yeares pa&s;t, and for ever hereafter, if your Highne&s;&s;e does not take the &s;ame into mo&s;t &s;erious con&s;ieration, and make it a State Action, the be&s;t way of recovering from the Dutch, all, or at lea&s;t one third part of the</HI> Mollucca <HI>I&s;lands, as our Ju&s;t due, or at lea&s;t the third part of the Spices there|on, according to the Contract made in 1619. with &s;atisfa|ction for their long detention of the &s;aid Spices from our Company; which Compo&s;ition, if &s;trongly pre&s;t, (as it de|&s;erves) may be &s;uch as may give rea&s;onable &s;atisfaction to the Company, and a large proportion of Stock to pro&s;ecute all tho&s;e rich Trades of</HI> India, Per&s;ia, Arabia, Mollucca I&s;lands, Manillios, China, and Japon, <HI>to the great in|crea&s;e of Trea&s;ure to your Highne&s;&s;e's Eachequer, and Stock of the Nation, or by laying it open and free for every &s;ub|ject

<P>But to leave the re&s;etling of the&s;e trades to the wi&s;dome of your Highne&s;&s;e and Councell of State, I &s;hall humbly pre&s;ent <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Commit|tees work the ruine of <HI>India</HI> trade on pur|po&s;e to buy off di&s;hertned peo|ples adventures at half their value.</NOTE> unto your Highne&s;&s;e &s;ome other di&s;hone&s;t proceedings, of tho&s;e Grandees, and managers of this action; who of purpo&s;e to undervalue the &s;ame, and di&s;hearten the Nobility, Gentry, Widdows and Orphans, and other Adventurers, not able to ride out of their Stocks any longer, &s;o much, as to &s;ell of their Adventures, as they did &s;ome hundreds of thou&s;and pounds,

<P>Be&s;ides this de&s;igne of buying up of Adventures at under values, a mo&s;t unju&s;t and di&s;hone&s;t cour&s;e, and breach of Oach and tru&s;t, they had a farther intention, which was, that <NOTE PLACE="marg">And gaine the Compo&s;ition with the Dutch, to them&s;elves, a mo&s;t di&s;ho|ne&s;t breach of tru&s;t.</NOTE> having by this meanes, got all, or the greater part of the Stock into a few of their owne, and confederates hands; they would then pre&s;&s;e his Maje&s;ty and Lords, in a more earne&s;t and importunate way then hertofore, to conclude the diffe|rence with the Dutch, and &s;o gaine that compo&s;ition al&s;o to their owne advantage; all which will appeare by their owne accompts and papers, if duly examined.</P>
<P>As to the trades of <HI>China</HI> and <HI>Japon,</HI> I can &s;ay little to the particular Commodities either carryed thither, or brought <NOTE PLACE="marg">China and Ja|pon have been to the Protu|gals, and Dutch very rich Trades.</NOTE> thence, more than in the Generall.

<P>All which, notwith&s;tanding tho&s;e &s;o rich trades of <HI>India,</HI> &amp;c. are no way to be e&s;teemed the wor&s;t, becau&s;e the managers thereof have not, made them &s;o profitable to this Common|wealth, as they have been to the Portugall heretofore, and are now to the Dutch, and may yet be unto us, if well regu|lated under a State-protection hereafter, as the other have been, and are to this day.</P>
<P>Having thus pre&s;ented to your Highne&s;&s;e, the evil affecti|on, wilfull mi&s;carriages, and improvident cour&s;es, to the rui|ning, if not utter &s;uppre&s;&s;ing of the&s;e &s;o rich and profitable trades of <HI>India, Per&s;ia, Arabia, China</HI> and <HI>Japon,</HI> practi&s;ed by that Court of Committees, who have had the managing thereof the&s;e many yeaers; I &s;hall humbly leave the&s;e to your Highne&s;s's and Council of States better judgements, for the future regulating thereof, in a more profitable way than hitherto, either by making it a State-action, as the be&s;t, and <NOTE PLACE="marg">The be&s;t way to make the Trade of India profitable to this Nation, is, to make it State-action.</NOTE> mo&s;t a&s;&s;ured way of benefit and honour to the Nation, or by laying it open and free for all men, that have a minde and meanes to pro&s;ecute tho&s;e Trades, being regulated, and or|dered, as are the Turkey and Mu&s;covy Trades, wherein eve|ry man is Ma&s;ter of his owne goods, both abroad and at home, aad hath the ordering and managing thereof at his plea&s;ure, and not tyed up to the many inconveniences of Joynt Stocks, and the di&s;hone&s;t ends of &s;ome particular o|ver-ruling Committees, who&s;e private Intere&s;t, and &s;urrep|titious wayes of Buying and Selling their owne goods, to them&s;elves, break through all Oaths and breach of Tru&s;t, even to the ruine of the Adventurers &s;tock, though to their owne particular profit enough advantagious; experience having told us, that joynt Stocks (as I &s;aid before) are but the wor&s;t of Monopolies, and meer Cheats, both to the State, and Ad|venturers, and of all others, this of the <HI>Ea&s;t Indies</HI> the greate&s;t.</P>
<P>But if your Highne&s;&s;e can renew the former Contracts made with the King of <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> 1622. and 1627. and enlarge that Trade, to the bringing all, or the greater part of the Silke of <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> by way of <HI>India,</HI> and compell the Dutch to pay the one halfe of their Cu&s;tomes to your Highne&s;&s;e, I

<P>I could &s;ay much more, in aggravation of the many and horrid injuries the Nation have received from the Dutch, but much more of the heavy lo&s;&s;es, and wrongfull abu&s;es, which &s;ome of that Court of Committees have occa&s;ioned; who over-ruling the more hone&s;t party by multiplicity of voices, and carrying all things to their owne ends, as profe&s;t enemies to that Trade of <HI>India,</HI> which &s;o long as managed by &s;uch, &s;hall never thrive, nor be worthy the name of an <NOTE PLACE="marg">A joynt &s;tock by Turkey Merchants ma|naged, never thrive.</NOTE> <HI>Ea&s;t India</HI> Trade; &s;uch as the Portugalls heretofore, and now the Dutch make of it, witne&s;&s;e the large returnes the&s;e latter have made thence every yeare, of value at lea&s;t 11. or 1200. thou&s;and pounds, be&s;ides their large Stock remaining in <HI>India,</HI> and their many and rich Plantations they have there, to be valued at many Millions of pounds, all which they have obtained by the managers of our Stocks wilfull neglect, as much unwilling our State &s;hould have any in&s;ight, command, or intere&s;t in any of their Plantations; as not willing the action it &s;elfe &s;houd thrive, and grow rich, for the rea&s;ons laid down in my foregoing di&s;cour&s;e, which I hope will &s;atisfie your Highne&s;&s;e and Councel of State, as to the reality of the things therein propo&s;ed, together with the nece&s;&s;ity of making it a State action, which will be the be&s;t, mo&s;t &s;afe, and profitable&s;t way, for the honour and welfare of the Nation, being &s;trengthned by your Highne&s;&s;e Counte|nance and protection, will put &s;uch terrour into all people, both farre and neere, as they will not dare to mole&s;t, or trou|ble our ju&s;t and lawfull proceedings, much le&s;&s;e offer any re|all wrong or injuries to the Nation as heretofore. When
<PB N="38" REF="24"> protection was wanting to the Company, again&s;t the barbarous inhumanity of our fal&s;e friends; as for the Por|tugale, a declared enemy, we were able to right our &s;elves on all occa&s;ions, had our Company &s;ought to plant them|&s;elves on the <HI>Molucca</HI> and <HI>Banda</HI> I&s;lands, as they ought to have done in the fir&s;t place, as did the Dutch, and then to have beaten their way for Trade, into the North parts of <HI>India.</HI> The maine (if not wilfull) errour of our Company, in the Infancy of that Trade, &s;o had we been Ma&s;ters of all tho&s;e forementioned rich Trades, to the great advancement of this Common-wealth, and Nation, which now may &s;eem irrevocably lo&s;t, to the great &s;hame and di&s;honour of this Common-wealth.</P>
<P>To conclude, tho&s;e rich Trades of <HI>India, Per&s;ia, Arabia, China,</HI> and <HI>Japon,</HI> did never appeare in their true lu&s;tre and &s;plendor, &s;o much as in the time the Portugals had the &s;ole Command of tho&s;e trades in their owne hands, before either we or the Dutch had made any di&s;covery thereof, when they had every yeare (if no Ships mi&s;carryed) at lea&s;t two Millions of pounds returned home on regi&s;ter, which paid cu&s;tomes to the King at high rates, be&s;ides Pearles, Diamonds, and other pretious &s;tones of great value, which came unregi&s;tred, and paid no Cu&s;tomes. Of all which, the Dutch have endeavou|red to make them&s;elves Ma&s;ters, and had accompli&s;hed, had not the Engli&s;h interpo&s;ed a pedling trade (for other I cannot call it) whom they dur&s;t not totally oppre&s;&s;e and beat out of tho&s;e Seas, however laboured by all the meanes they could invent, and the more upon our Companies neglect of Trade, which gave them the advantage of making them &s;o rich, and powerfull, as to dare to conte&s;t with your Highne&s;&s;e and State here at home, in hopes to have &s;wallowed up the whole Nation in a Conque&s;t, and &s;o have made them&s;elves the ab&s;olute&s;t Commanders by Sea, that ever yet the world knew; and &s;o have brought into &s;ubjection, not onely the Ea&s;t and We&s;t <HI>Indies,</HI> but even all other Trades throughtout the whole world; but being beaten into better behaviour by your Highne&s;&s;e power by Sea, it is hoped your Highne&s;&s;e may in time worke the &s;ame for our Nation, being vigilant and care|full,
