<HEAD>THE SPANISH FLEET OVER|throwne in the Sea going to a&s;&s;i&s;t the Rebels in <HI>Ireland.</HI></HEAD>
<P>ENuy is the badge of en&s;uing cruelty, malice is the Typicall <HI>Idaea</HI> of tyranie, for when as inte&s;tine malice becomes inveterate, no|thing can &s;atisfie it, but bloud, nothing can quench the a&s;piring flame of their ardent intentions, but the immolation of bloud, nothing la&s;tly can &s;top the impetuous violence of the &s;wift run|ning torrent of their greedy minds, but humane fle&s;h. O horred Tyrannie, Yea where Envy is entertayned in the habitacle of the mind, there men will not de&s;i&s;t to plough over the Ocean, untill they come to the object of their re&s;olutions, where like in a luxurious harve&s;t they will glutt their hungry &s;wordes in humane fle&s;h, and make drunke their thir&s;ty &s;peares with mortall bloud, and cut downe the trunkes of living men, as the ravenous &s;ithe devoures the trembling come. This malice I &s;ay, &s;o tyrannicall, &s;o bloudy, &s;o nefari|ous have beene lodged in the inte&s;tine brea&s;ts of the <HI>Spaniard</HI> a long time: who have alwaies in|tended to depopulate, and &s;ubvert the Britti&s;h
<PB REF="3">Nation to the utter demolition of Prote&s;tant Religion. But being oftentimes prevented in their de&s;ignes, they have beene more vehement|ly de&s;irous to come to the object of their former intended con&s;piracies again&s;t the Briti&s;h Nation. VVherefore having &s;ome oppertunity in <HI>Ireland</HI> having there Rebells that would connive with them, and concurre in a bloudy Ma&s;&s;acre they &s;ent over before St. Patricke Devons with a num|erous multitude of men to the number of above five thou&s;and and more in Armes, Who went in a Navie into <HI>Ireland</HI> to the auxiliation of the Rebells. Where although at their fir&s;t arrivall <HI>Turone</HI> and his confederates joyfully entertayned him with re&s;pective congratulation for his love: yet the Earle of <HI>Clanrickards</HI> afterwards &s;aluted him with a valley of &s;hot and &s;lew mo&s;t of his men that were under his command. Having &s;uch ill &s;ucce&s;&s;e in their fir&s;t Navie, they congrega|ted another three times greater then the former, to the number of fiveteene thou&s;and men tran|&s;porting with them many Armes and military Ammunition to re-a&s;i&s;t the Rebells. Thus be|ing armed as well internally in their re&s;olutions as enternally, they tooke Shipping, and with great alacrity <HI>Navem a&s;cenderunt,</HI> they thus pro|ceeded to <HI>Ireland</HI> very jocund; having &s;ent a <HI>He|rald</HI> of Armes before to the Rebells giving them notice of their comming; but at length as they were all tuned in their luxurious thoughts of
<PB REF="3">inhumane crueltie, a &s;uddaine and violent Tem|pe&s;t aro&s;e, which di&s;&s;ipated their &s;hips, beate them vehemently upon a Rocke, and their Navie being impetuou&s;ly disjected in pieces, they were drowned in the all-devouring Sea. Thus we may &s;ee the ju&s;t Judgement of Almightie God, who&s;e omnipotencie will not permit &s;uch ravenous Wolves to devoure his little Flocke. For although like the <HI>Aegyptians</HI> they did follow us, as they did the <HI>I&s;raelites,</HI> yet like <HI>Pharaoh,</HI> and all his Ho&s;te, they were overwhelmed in the Sea. But not to digre&s;&s;e from my intended Sub|ject in a too errant deviation, I will recall my Pen to it's former di&s;cour&s;e. The Rebels being fru&s;tra|ted of their expectation in the Spani&s;h Fleet, and perceiving they were all drowned in the Ocean, be|gan to deplore and condole their inau&s;pitious fate, greatly lamenting their di&s;a&s;trous fortune. But would to God, while they pampe forth gu&s;hing teares from their eyes, for the overthrow of the Spaniards, that it might &s;well to a Deluge, and like them, overwhelme them&s;elves in the inunda|tion of their own teares. But to omit the &s;uperflu|ous de&s;cription of their griefe, I will expre&s;&s;e the Letter which was &s;ent from the Spani&s;h Fleet by the Herald of Armes to the Lord <HI>Donmadoffe</HI> the Arch Rebell in <HI>Ireland.</HI></P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>Right Honourable,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE plau&s;ible commendation of your magnanimous courage in pro&s;ecution of the Prote&s;tant party being oftentimes annunci|ated unto us, have at this time re&s;pectively in|duced us to pre&s;ent an auxiliary Army unto your honours gracious acceptance: which is the height of our ambition to obtaine. We have maturely con&s;idered of the multiplicitie of the numerous confronts given you heretofore by the Prote&s;tants, and of the abu&s;ive in&s;ultations which they have u&s;urped over you, and &s;ometimes over our &s;elves too: we therefore are re&s;olved to vindicate both our owne cau&s;e, and yours: which apparently &s;hall be demon&s;trated, and &s;ufficiently declared to the Britti&s;h Nation at our fir&s;t arrivall. My Lord, if your Honour would vouch&s;afe to con|curre with us in a conjunction of our Armies we doubt not but we &s;hall &s;ubvert them at our fir&s;t &s;alutation, and become &s;o victorious, that we may returne with an Olive branch in our hands. In the meane time what we mo&s;t implore in our ardent de&s;ires is your acceptance of our &s;ervice: which if you grant, &s;hall be a perfect Type of our ob|&s;equious opitulation and a &s;ufficient Caractar of our en&s;uing victory.</P>

<HEAD>An Order from the <HI>Committee</HI> that <HI>11300</HI> Hor&s;e &s;hould be conducted by Sir <HI>Simon Harecolt.</HI> into IRELAND. As al&s;o, <HI>A Letter read in the Parliament, &s;ent from the Mayer of Doublin and other Ju&s;tices of the Peace, how</HI> Tredagh <HI>is be&s;ieged, and</HI> Doublin <HI>in great feare of the Enemy.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THe Committee having maturely and judi|ciou&s;ly con&s;idered of the extreame calami|ty, and great mi&s;ery which the Prote|&s;tants in <HI>Ireland</HI> dayly undergoe, by tho&s;e bloudy and inhumane Tyrants, the Rebels: who have nei|ther mercy nor partiality in them: did forthwith Order, that pre&s;ent and auxiliary ayd &s;hould be immediately provided for the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Prote&s;tant party; and they appointed more-over, That Sir <HI>Simon Harecolt</HI> &s;hould conduct eleven thou&s;and and three hundred Hor&s;e for the &s;ame purpo&s;e. For they had diver&s;e Letters directed unto them from the Mayre of <HI>Dublin,</HI> and other Ju&s;tices of Peace, intimating, That <HI>Tredagh</HI> was be&s;ieged by the Rebels, and <HI>Dublin</HI> likewi&s;e in great danger of their tyrannicall inhumanity. Their proceedings are &s;o nefariou&s;ly abominable, that they &s;eeme not onely to be dete&s;table in the
<PB REF="5">&s;ight of God, but al&s;o odious in the eares of Men. And who&s;oever truely perpends the Afflictions of the Britti&s;h Nation, and what calamity they are involved, cannot but eliciate teares from his heart, were it of a meere Adamantine Compo&s;ition. Their inhumanity is not terminated in the limi|tation of humane lenity, but has beene &s;o merci|le&s;&s;e, that the Parliament have re&s;pectively beene indued to &s;end them an expedient and nece&s;&s;ary auxiliation.</P>
