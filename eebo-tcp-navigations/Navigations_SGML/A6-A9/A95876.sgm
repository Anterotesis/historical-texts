<HEAD>CHAP. I. How King Pepin bani&s;hed his Queen Bertha; And how he gave his Si&s;ter Belly&s;ant in Marriage to Alexander, Emperor of Con&s;tantinople.</HEAD>
<P>_WE find it credibly &s;et down in ancient Chronicles, that the thrice Noble and Valiant <HI>Pepi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">,</HI> &s;ome|times a King of <HI>France,</HI> took to Wife one <HI>Bertha,</HI> who was de&s;cended of no le&s;s then Royal Race: This Lady was exceeding fair and wi&s;e, but won|drou&s;ly cumbred with many adver&s;ities, and trou|bles, enviou&s;ly be&s;et on every &s;ide: which with great patience &s;he always &s;uffered.</P>
<P>The chief In&s;trument of all this treacherous mi&s;chief toward this good Queen, was plotted and effected by a fal&s;e and cur&s;ed old woman, who fir&s;t of all brought her in di&s;grace with the King her Husband, and after to be quite bani&s;hed his Bed, whil&s;t &s;he in cunning manner brought in a Daughter of her own unto the Kings Bed in&s;tead of his good Queen <HI>Bertha:</HI> This old woman having thus brought her treachery to effect (for her Daughter &s;omewhat re&s;embled <HI>Bertha</HI>) it &s;o came to pa&s;s, that King <HI>Pepin</HI> had two Sons by this Maiden, to wit, <HI>Haufrey</HI> and <HI>Henry,</HI> both which Sons &s;o grieved the King, and &s;o wa&s;ted the Country of <HI>France</HI> by their outrages and fury, that in the end they cau&s;e the

The Queen being thus re&s;tored to her former bed, in &s;hort time conceived and bare unto the King a goodly Son, called <HI>Charlemain</HI> the pui&s;&s;ant: But the King him&s;elf was conti|nually hunted from place to place, by the afore&s;aid <HI>Haufrey</HI> and <HI>Henry,</HI> and at the la&s;t by them compelled to for&s;ake his Realm, as hereafter followeth more at large in the en&s;uing Hi&s;tory.</P>
<P>My purpo&s;e now at this pre&s;ent is, to &s;et down unto the Rea|der, the whole matter contained in this Book: and e&s;pecially, the valiant acts and deeds of <HI>Valentine</HI> and his Brother <HI>Or&s;on.</HI></P>
<P>This King <HI>Pepin</HI> had a Si&s;ter named <HI>Belly&s;ant,</HI> a woman of great wit, beauty, and all the endowments that Nature might afford, which cau&s;ed her Brother <HI>Pepins</HI> love mightily to appear to all the world, in the ardent love and affection that he bare to|wards her. It chanced &s;o, that the fame of this lovely per&s;onage &s;pread it &s;elf &s;o abroad in other Regions, that at la&s;t, King <HI>Alex|ander,</HI> Emperour of <HI>Con&s;tan<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">inople,</HI> who was much enflamed with her beauty, came into <HI>France,</HI> accompanied with a gallant Troop of his Nobility, all richly &s;et out with all manner of Pomp belonging to &s;o great a per&s;onage.</P>
<P>This Emperor, &s;hortly after his arrival, &s;uddenly a&s;&s;embled all his Lords in their rich habiliments, appointing them to take their way towards King <HI>Pepins</HI> Court, to declare unto him the cau&s;e of his coming; which was to enjoy his fair Si&s;ter <HI>Belly&s;ant</HI> in Marriage. The Nobles, according to his command, came un|to King <HI>Pepin,</HI> declaring unto him the cau&s;e of their Emperours coming into his Country: which when King <HI>Pepin</HI> under&s;tood, be joyfully entertained them, and granted quickly the Emperours reque&s;t,</P>
<PB N="3" REF="6">
<P>King <HI>Pepin</HI> under&s;tanding this &s;udden (but joyful) News, made great preparation in his Court, for the entertaining of this No|ble Emperor; and cau&s;ed all his Nobles and Attendants to go with him in great Pomp and Triumph, to meet this Noble Em|peror. All things being in readine&s;s, King <HI>Pepin</HI> with all his Noble Train, went to meet <HI>Alexan<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">er</HI> Emperor of <HI>Con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">tantino|ple:</HI> whom when they met, they entertained with great joy, and conducted him to the Court of <HI>France,</HI> where fair <HI>Belly&s;ant</HI> was, and &s;he entertained him with no le&s;s joy, then her Brother King <HI>Pepin</HI> had done before: and there they &s;pent their time in great joy and Triumphing.</P>
<P>This Marriage being once publiquely known among all the Inhabitants, joy began to &s;hew forth it &s;elf on every &s;ide, for &s;uch a happy day, wherein &s;uch good Alliance was knit between the Emperor <HI>Alexander,</HI> and <HI>Pepin</HI> King of <HI>France;</HI> that Triumphs began in every place, again&s;t the Nuptial days appear|ance.

<PB N="4" REF="7"> When the time appointed came, the&s;e two were e&s;pou&s;ed in all honour fitting for their E&s;tates, and largne&s;s &s;hewed it &s;elf on every &s;ide. This Marriage Fea&s;t endured long, but at la&s;t being ended, the Emperour (a&s;&s;i&s;ted with all his worthy Train) made preparation to take their leave of King <HI>Pepin</HI> his Brother in Law, and take their way towards <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> with his fair Empre&s;s <HI>Belly&s;ant.</HI> Being thus all mounted on Hor&s;e-back, King <HI>Pepin</HI> al&s;o &s;et forward with his Brother Emperor, to bring him on his way, Royally attended on every &s;ide, with Lords, Ladies, and many other Gallants of the Court: And they that could not find legs to go, found eyes to weep for the departure of their fair Lady and Mi&s;tre&s;s, the new Empre&s;s of <HI>Con&s;tantino|ple.</HI></P>
<P>At la&s;t, both the&s;e mighty Princes came neer unto a Port of the Sea, whereat they mu&s;t needs part; there taking leave of each other, they were forced to render more thanks in tears, then words, the which I am not able to expre&s;s: But above all, the Emperor yielded King <HI>Pepin</HI> worthy thanks for his quick, &s;ud|den, and generous con&s;ent, in giving to him his fair Si&s;ter <HI>Bel|ly&s;ant,</HI> and with &s;o frank and free a heart to yield him his good will. At which words of the Emperour, unto King <HI>Pepin,</HI> the King pre&s;ently embraced him in his arms; &s;aying, Fair Sir, and my right loving Lord and Brother, I have not received you ac|cording as your State required, nor with &s;uch Triumphs and Magnificence as became me, but in that you have &s;o graciou&s;ly accepted my &s;mall power, I hold my &s;elf content in that I have done, but not that I &s;hould have done: and therefore there be|longeth &s;mall thanks to me, but from me innumerable, in that you have been plea&s;ed to accept of my Si&s;ter for your wife; where|by (I tru&s;t) long friend&s;hip &s;hall be continued betwixt us; In token whereof, I take witne&s;s of all that are here pre&s;ent, that my Body, my Realm, my Goods, and all the powers that I can rai&s;e in <HI>France,</HI> to adventure for your &s;afety and &s;uccour, all the days of my life.</P>
<P>King <HI>Pepin</HI> being now departed from the Emperor, turned him&s;elf to his Si&s;ter <HI>Belly&s;ant,</HI> and in this manner takes his leave: Fair Si&s;ter (quoth he) think no longer of this Countrey
<PB N="5" REF="7"> of <HI>France,</HI> wherein you have &s;pent your infant days, but remem|ber that you are removed to a Country of better conditions. Al&s;o let your behaviour be &s;uch, that I, the re&s;t of your Friends, and the whole company of all the Peers, may have honour and joy in you.</P>
<P>Again, as the Country where you now do go is &s;trange unto you, &s;o be you governed by the mode&s;t Ladies of the Land, and give no ear to wicked coun&s;el, or to &s;uch as would move you to di&s;loyalty; For you are the Creature that I have always deare&s;t loved in all the world; wherefore, if I &s;hould hear tydings other then good from you, or of you, it would be the only cau&s;e to take a|way my life. After this he gave unto his Si&s;ter many worthy gifts, and &s;o embracing and ki&s;&s;ing her, with weeping eyes, he left her to the mercy of the Waves. The young Lady, who&s;e heart being overcharged betwixt joy and fear, was not able to an&s;wer a word, and what with tears, and &s;ighs, the pa&s;&s;age of her tongue was utterly &s;topt. Then all the Lords and Ladies took their leave each of other, at which was let fall many a brini&s;h tear, as well on their parts of <HI>France,</HI> as they al&s;o that were to go for <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> but e&s;pecially for the departure of the fair Lady <HI>Belly&s;ant.</HI></P>
<P>All duties of love being ended, King <HI>Pepin</HI> returned into <HI>France,</HI> and the Emperor by this time mounted on the Seas, had wind and water at &s;uch will and plea&s;ure, that within &s;hort &s;pace, he with all his Train arrived with &s;afety at <HI>Con&s;tantinople:</HI> where at their landing they were all received with great Ioy, Ho|nour, and Triumph; all which, here were needle&s;s to recount. But mark what hapned; not long after the&s;e joys and Triumphs were clean extingui&s;hed, that were made for the Lady <HI>Belly&s;ant,</HI> in place thereof, nothing but mournings, lamentations, and tears were placed, and all for the &s;aid poor Lady, which by trea&s;on and fal&s;e accu&s;ations, was ca&s;t out and bani&s;hed, as hereafter more at large you &s;hall perceive.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. II. How the Arch-prie&s;t of Con&s;tantinople betrayed the Emperor his Lord and Ma&s;ter in making love to fair Belly&s;ant the Empre&s;s, and what evil followed thereupon.</HEAD>
<P>IN <HI>Con&s;tantinople</HI> lived an Arch-Prie&s;t, in whom the Empe|ror put &s;uch tru&s;t, and loved &s;o fervently, that he be&s;towed up|on him great Riches and Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, and committed all his bo|&s;om-thoughts unto his Secrecy: And in the end made him &s;ole Governour and Commander over all his hou&s;e; as al&s;o, he was the Emperors Principal Confe&s;&s;or, and one of his greate&s;t Coun&s;ellors, for the which, he afterwards had many a &s;orrowful heart.</P>
<P>This Bi&s;hop, forgetting all the Emperors favours, and great honours done unto him, being intangled and overcome with the beauty of the new Empre&s;s, which excelled all mortal creatures, inordinate lu&s;t prevailed with him &s;o far, that there was nothing &s;tood in his way, &s;ave only fit time and opportunity, to &s;ettle this his determination. At la&s;t it chanced on a day, that he e&s;pyed her all alone, &s;itting &s;olitarily in her Chamber, which this Arch-Prie&s;t well ob&s;erving, he came into the Chamber likewi&s;e, and &s;at down by her: At la&s;t he began to behold her with a &s;miling and je&s;ting countenace, of all which (the Lady mi&s;tru&s;ted nothing) for that &s;he very well remembred his greatne&s;s with the Empe|ror, and his familiarity in the hou&s;e, and &s;he never &s;o much as once dreaming or thinking &s;uch an evil thought, as that he there|by would colour &s;o foul and filthy an Act, as to motion her to di&s;ho|nour, e&s;pecially towards the Emperor his worthy Lord and Ma&s;ter, who &s;o dearly e&s;teemed of him, and &s;o much affected him: But there is never more danger like to en&s;ue, then when one of the &s;ame hou&s;e intendeth Trea&s;on. But at the la&s;t, after many ge&s;tures of impurity, and &s;itting &s;till by this worthy and vertuous Lady, he began to utter his lacivious thoughts on this manner.</P>
<PB N="7" REF="8">
<P>Right dear and Soveraign Lady (quoth he) I am your Ser|vant and Chaplain; therefore I be&s;eech you not to &s;top your ears, but rather &s;et them wide open to hear my rude words; e&s;pecially, for that I am burnt up in affection towards your fair per&s;on, and for who&s;e love I have &s;uffered intollerable torments in my fiery bo&s;om. Know therefore (my redoubted Lady) that the beauty of your admirable per&s;on, and the &s;upernal form wherein you are framed and compo&s;ed, hath even ravi&s;hed my Spirits, broken my heart, &s;plit my whole &s;ences in &s;under, and quite bereft me of all re&s;t, both by night and day, and onely with doting upon your peerle&s;s beauty. Again (fair Lady) my Meat, Drink, Manners, yea, and my very conutenance, they all plead at the Bar of your fair face, and re&s;pendent Countenance; In&s;omuch, that onely my reque&s;t, and prayers unto the Gods, is even this, that they would &s;o inchant that heart of yours, that you would at length give con&s;ent unto me your va&s;&s;al, that I might not onely &s;erve you, but al&s;o delight you in all tho&s;e plea&s;ures you are ordained unto. If, Lady, you refu&s;e me, and ca&s;t me off, denying the&s;e my unre&s;tle&s;s thoughts (than which nothing will &s;ooner cut my heart in &s;under) I can look for nothing but pre&s;ent death, and ra|ther covet therein to be locked fa&s;t, as in a Pri&s;on, than receive a denial from tho&s;e your fair lips. Alas! (fair Lady) you are re|nowned in all the gifts of Nature: Fair, Amiable, Courteous, Gentle, and al&s;o Youthful, be not then the cau&s;e that I &s;hould determine my life, by lo&s;ing your love, but rather grant what I de&s;ire, and thereby make me for ever yours in hearty affection. But, Lady, happily you will urge, how dare you to offend the Gods in this unlawful act? To this, fair Lady, I an&s;wer, I am one of the Vicars of the Gods upon earth, and therefore it wholly re&s;ts in my power, to ab&s;olve you from your &s;ins, and injoyn you Penance; which tru&s;t me Lady, &s;hall fall out to be but very ea|&s;ie, &s;o you grant me love.</P>
<P>The&s;e &s;peeches of his being ended, the Lady thereunto, out of a grave and prudent car<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">iage, made unto this perjur'd Prie&s;t this excellent reprehen&s;ion and an&s;wer. Ah, thou fal&s;e, unju&s;t, di&s;loyal, and Devili&s;h Prie&s;t, &s;tain to all thy profe&s;&s;ion; How dare&s;t thou once open thy perjured mouth to &s;uch a ma&s;s of villianies as
<PB N="8" REF="9"> thereon may en&s;ue? Fir&s;t, as I &s;aid, again&s;t the &s;acred order; &s;e|condly, but mo&s;t principally, again&s;t the Maje&s;ty of that Emperor, that hath ever nouri&s;hed thee in the bond of tender compa&s;&s;ion and love, and hath rai&s;ed thee to great Dignities, far unfit for &s;uch a Devil incarnate: And from whom may ju&s;tly proc&eacute;ed the &s;entence of condemnation, both on thee and me, if he &s;hould but under&s;tand thy la&s;civious and wicked practi&s;es. Thou (I &s;ay) Devil, and wor&s;e than Devil) thou that &s;houlde&s;t be unto me in&s;truction, and al&s;o a guide to my life and conver&s;ation, in this thou goe&s;t about my utter ruine and de&s;truction, by thy evil conditions, even be|yond that good expectation which the Emperor tru&s;teth to be in thee; O never grant (O ye Gods) that the blood of <HI>France,</HI> from whence I am de&s;cended, nor the Emperor my loving Lord, &s;hould be &s;o di&s;honoured either by me in my body, or through my privity in any other manner: O fal&s;e accur&s;ed man, behold whereunto thou woulde&s;t deliver me: Fir&s;t, unto the utter ruine and &s;poil of mine honor: next, &s;hut up my body in unremoveable &s;hame for ever, among&s;t men; and la&s;tly bring my &s;oul into the Jaws of Death and the Devil. Let fall, I &s;ay, all the&s;e thy vile and devil|i&s;h provocations to lu&s;t, and leave for ever hereafter to &s;olicite me, or any other vertuous creature on this manner, which if thou fur|ther pro&s;ecute unto me, then can&s;t thou look for nothing but a &s;hameful downfal, and a mo&s;t damnable death. Therefore with this an&s;wer depart, and &s;ee that ye attempt me no more.</P>
<P>Tis angry farewel of the worthy Empre&s;s, &s;tung the Prie&s;t at the very heart, but at that time dur&s;t make no further reply unto the fair Lady concerning love, but as a man all compo&s;ed of rage and great fury, he then departed, di&s;content at this his mo&s;t unfortunate and unhappy chance. At the la&s;t, when he could no longer hold he excu&s;ed him&s;elf unto the Lady, craving pardon for the&s;e his bold, &s;awcy and ra&s;h follies committed, but yet could find no remedy to re&s;tore his honor. Thus being &s;ore troubled in mind divers and &s;undry ways, he re&s;olved what to do upon revenge again&s;t this innocent, which he accordingly effected by Trea|&s;on again&s;t the Lady. And &s;eeing the Emperor knew nothing in this matter from the Empre&s;s <HI>Belly&s;ant,</HI> how the Arch-Prie&s;t would have inticed her to di&s;honor, and would have drawn
<PB N="9" REF="9"> her to di&s;loyalty to the Emperor, but he could not, therefore he began to accu&s;e her unto the Emperor for divers crimes, as here|after more at large followeth to be &s;poken in this next en&s;uing Chapter.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. III. How the Arch-Prie&s;t having received this repul&s;e at the hands of Belly&s;ant, to &s;ave his own honour, practi&s;ed Trea&s;on again&s;t the innocent Lady.</HEAD>
<P>THe Arch-Prie&s;t having now begun to &s;et abroach his De|vili&s;h practi&s;es, began to bethink him how he might effect what he had determined, and al&s;o pre&s;erve the reputation of his former Honours which the Emperor had be&s;towed upon him: whereupon at la&s;t he re&s;olved, that he would cunningly under the cloak of di&s;&s;imulation bear fair weather towards the Emperor, as al&s;o &s;&eacute;emed to &s;hew how great care he had of his pre&s;ervation and to make known his Loyalty and watchful care that he ever had towards the welfare of his E&s;tate &amp; Per&s;on. So it befel, that on a day when he e&s;pyed a fit opportunity, and taking the Emperor all alone, he began to break with him on this manner, as followeth:</P>
<P>Right High and Mighty Emperor, and my very good Lord and Ma&s;ter, I cannot chu&s;e but recount and highly e&s;teem of the ma|ny and innumerable favours, and great kindne&s;s which I have always received from your Mighty Highne&s;s: wherefore as duty doth always bind me, I am ever mo&s;t watchful over the pa&s;&s;ages of your e&s;tate, in which I now &s;tand by you appointed; But e&s;pecially in that you have made me &s;ole Commander in your Hou&s;e, and therein tru&s;ted me above all other: therefore it is my duty, to bewray unto you all tho&s;e carriages that any way concern your High and Migty Per&s;on: wherefore I be&s;eech your Highne&s;s to give ear to that which I &s;hall now di&s;clo&s;e un|to
<PB N="10" REF="10"> you, for I had rather &s;uffer all the torments of death, than for to hide any thing from you: and the rather, for that it nearly touch|eth your per&s;on, profit, and honor. O Emperor, thus it is, <HI>Belly|&s;ant</HI> your Wife, and Si&s;ter to the King of <HI>France,</HI> &s;he whom you have advanced to this &s;tate and dignity, faileth in the Duty and loyalty which &s;he oweth unto her dread Lord: for &s;he wandreth in her love, giveth it unto another, which is proper only to your &s;elf. To name the per&s;on unto your Maje&s;ty I will not, for you know I am a &s;acred Prie&s;t, and may not &s;&eacute;ek the blood of any man: but yet know for certain, that by the way of confe&s;&s;ion I came unto the light thereof, whereof I neither ought nor will bewray the name of him that thus u&s;urps your Bed: but let it &s;uffice, there is not a more unclean and lacivious woman liveth in your Court or Kingdom, whereby your life is in danger, your honour defamed, and my duty towards you approved by what I have told you. My advice therefore is, to be wary of your per&s;on, and correct this her folly, but yet mildly and wi&s;ely, always with the pre&s;erva|tion of your Honor. For will it not be a great &s;hame among the Princes of the Earth, that you, having taken a Wife, Si&s;ter to a great King one who for her beauty is incomparable, her noble|ne&s;s and Wi&s;dom not to be out&s;hined by any earthly Lad<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">, and &s;he to prove a Whore? and what wor&s;e is, one who daily de&s;ireth your death, which grieves my heart to think upon.</P>
<P>The Emperor having heard this long Accu&s;ation, little mi&s;|tru&s;ted the treachery of this Arch-Prie&s;t, but gave credit to all his fair, but fal&s;e words: and therewithal became extream pen|&s;ive and &s;ad: that his tru&s;t in her beautious Love, had been thus deceived. At la&s;t, having many days in many places uttered forth many di&s;contented ge&s;tures, words, and &s;ighs, and many grievous acclamations, even in the Emperial Palace, he gave re&s;t a while unto his di&s;contented Pa&s;&s;ions: but wakened Re|venge to wait upon fitter opportunity. And upon a day enter|ing into the Chamber of his fair Lady <HI>Belly&s;ant,</HI> without &s;peak|ing any Word to her at all, in mo&s;t fierce, rude, and unman|ly order, took his Lady by the head, and pulling her by the hair, he dragged her about the Chamber, throwing her on the ground in &s;uch a horrid manner, that the blood be&s;meared all her face in
<PB N="11" REF="10"> mo&s;t inhumane &s;ort. The Lady receiving from her Lord &s;uch unlookt for welcom, cried out in lamentable manner, and as well as &s;he was able began to &s;ay: Alas (my dear Lord) what mo|veth you to this unwelcome out-rage? I call all the Gods to witne&s;s, I never did any thing in my life, either again&s;t your ho|nour or life, or ever pro&s;tituted my body to any Strangers love. The Emperour not being thus &s;atisfied, replyed, &s;aying: Thou Whore, I am too well informed of thy proceedings, and cur&s;ed be the day and hour that ever I &s;aw thy deceiveable Face, and therewithal, without all pitty da&s;hed her head again&s;t the ground leaving her &s;peechle&s;s, in&s;omuch that all the Damo&s;els, her atten|dants, thought &s;he had been quite bereft of life. Vpon this, there aro&s;e up in the Court a mo&s;t pitiful out-cry, which the Coun&s;el|lors and other Attendants in the Court hearing, ran &s;peedily to the Chamber, whereas they found this Lady in a Trance; at which di&s;a&s;ter all amazed, &s;ome ran to take up the dead body of the Empre&s;s, others took upon them to &s;peak unto the Emperor, thinking thereby to &s;tay the fury of this unde&s;erved rage, who&s;e Words unto him were as followeth.</P>
<P>Alas (dread Soveraign) what may be the cau&s;e of this your &s;udden pa&s;&s;ion in delivering unto danger of death, this &s;o mode&s;t, cha&s;te and noble a Lady: A Lady &s;o beloved of all degrees, and in whom was never &s;een the lea&s;t &s;park of di&s;honour, neither to|wards you nor any within this Empire: wherefore our reque&s;t unto you is, that you would moderate your wrong conceived an|ger again&s;t this harmle&s;s Lady. The Emperor nothing for all this relenting, an&s;wered, Speak no more, for I know, I &s;ee, I hear, how cunningly &s;he hath deluded me: therefore move me no further, for I am fully purpo&s;ed to deliver her over to death, and be or they who &s;hall hereunto gain-&s;ay, I &s;hall make him parta|ker (in death) with this wicked and di&s;loyal Strumpet.</P>
<P>The&s;e words were no &s;ooner uttered, but up aro&s;e a Worthy, Wi&s;e, and couragious bold Baron, and &s;pake unto the Emperor after this manner: Right worthy Sir, I could wi&s;h you to be well advi&s;ed before you proceed further again&s;t this Lady, who is your e&s;pou&s;ed wife, &s;i&s;ter to a great King, namely <HI>Pepin,</HI> King of <HI>France,</HI> who when he &s;hall hear of this wrong done to her, will out of a
<PB N="12" REF="11"> couragious heart and a Brotherly affection, mu&s;ter up all his men of War, and &s;uddenly &s;urprize our Towns, Hou&s;es, Wives, and Children, forgetting Mercy, and onely pur&s;uing revenge upon us, for the&s;e Mercile&s;s and cruel Deeds unto his Si&s;ter. Again, con&s;iver on the other &s;ide, that the Lady is great with Child, therefore it is dangerous &s;o rudely to &s;mite and wound her on this manner, wherein you have proceeded again&s;t her. The worthy Baron having thus ended his advice, the Lady &s;uddenly fell upon her knees before the Emperor, and in tears very &s;ubmi&s;&s;ively and lamentably, thus &s;he &s;pake:</P>
<P>Alas (my Lord) take pitty on an innocent Lady, for I am &s;o free from any evil-act, as I never &s;o much as thought any evil a|gain&s;t your per&s;on, or dignity: at lea&s;t my Lord, if your compa&s;|&s;ion be quite di&s;tinct from pittying me, yet pitty the fruit of my body, for I am great with child by you, of which the Gods grant me a joyful delivery. If nothing can appea&s;e your anger towards me, then let my body be impri&s;oned in &s;ome &s;trong Tower, till the time of my delivery, and then do with my body what plea&s;eth you, &s;o the fruit of my body may be kept &s;afe. In this dolorous pa&s;&s;ion &s;he proceeded &s;o far, that what with her &s;ighs and tears following one the other, it would have grieved the &s;to<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ie&s;t heart that ever re&s;ted in the bo&s;om of the vile&s;t Tyrant that ever reigned.</P>
<P>All this nothing moved the hard-hearted Emperor, who was &s;o wholly bewitched with the fal&s;e and traiterous accu&s;ation of the Arch-Prie&s;t, that all lenity &s;et apart, he bur&s;t-out in this manner: Thou fal&s;e Strumpet, the Child thou goe&s;t withal is to me no joy, but rather great di&s;honour, for thy behaviour and thy di&s;loyalty hath made &s;uch a &s;eperation between us, that noting thy di&s;&s;olate life, thou ha&s;t made another partner in my love: The Courtiers perceiving nothing could mitigate the rage of the Emperor, by a common con&s;ent removed her out of his pre|&s;ence into another Chamber, &s;hewing unto her all the favour they could both in action and ge&s;ture, although her fair face was &s;ore deformed and be&s;meared with blood. Having thus conveyed her away, the Ladies that were Attendants, fetched water to wa&s;h her face, and did all they could, to revive her ever-dying Spirits.
<PB N="13" REF="11"> Being thus in another chamber, in comes <HI>Blandiman</HI> her Squire, who beholding her in this di&s;figured manner, for very pitty the water trickled down his cheeks, &amp; at the la&s;t he began his &s;peech in this manner.</P>
<P>Ah Madam, I plainly &s;ee that you are trayterou&s;ly handled, and wi&s;h that the Gods would throw down their malignant cur|&s;es upon that per&s;on that hath thus purcha&s;ed your extream mi|&s;eries; But gentle Lady, take comfort unto you, and tru&s;t me, if you will be ruled by me, I will conduct you back again into <HI>France</HI> toward your Brother King <HI>Pepin,</HI> who gave me and my &s;ervice unto you, to attend you in all the&s;e misfortunes, all which I will to the utmo&s;t of my power undertake. Sw&eacute;et Lady, follow my coun&s;el and free your &s;elf out of danger, for be you a&s;&s;ured, that if here you &s;tay, the Emperor will pro&s;ecute revenge upon you, and in the end bring you unto a &s;hameful death.</P>
<P>Vnto this the &s;orrowful Lady made this reply; Ah <HI>Blandiman,</HI> I know thy faithful &s;ervice towards me, but yet, if I &s;hould fol|low thy advice, &amp; &s;teal out of this Country &s;ecretly, it would argue me guilty of all that infamy the Emperor throweth upon me, and thereby yeild me guilty of the deed: Believe me Servant, I had rather dye all the deaths the world can lay upon me, rather than to bear the blame of that wherein I am innocent.</P>
<P>By this time the Emperors Choller was &s;omewhat pacified, by means of his Lords and Barons that attended, in&s;omuch that he cau&s;ed <HI>Belly&s;ant</HI> to be quickly brought before him. When &s;he was come, his heart trembled and fretted, for very anger, that he dur&s;t not put her to death, fearing the pui&s;&s;ance and might of her Brother King <HI>Pepin,</HI> and therefore bra&s;t out into the&s;e &s;peeches: Thou fal&s;e and accur&s;ed Woman, by whom mine Honour is brought in que&s;tion: I take the Gods to witne&s;s, were it not for thy Brothers &s;ake, the valiant <HI>Pepin</HI> King of <HI>France,</HI> I would make thee fry in the fire, as an example to all fair Ladies: but for his &s;ake I &s;pare thy life, &s;tand forth and hear thy judgement, I bani&s;h thee out of my Country and Empire, expre&s;ly com|manding, that without any delay, to morrow thou depart out of this City, and if thou &s;halt ever be &s;een here any more, I a&s;&s;ure thee thou &s;halt &s;uffer death in all extremity: Al&s;o, I
<PB N="14" REF="12"> &s;traightly commanded that none of my Country dare be once <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">o hardy, as to give aid, or accompany you, &s;ave onely your &s;ervant <HI>Blandiman,</HI> whom you brought with you out of <HI>France.</HI> Go, get thee pre&s;ently out of my &s;ight, for thou &s;halt never more &s;leep in my bo&s;ome. The Emperor having pronounced &s;entence again&s;t her, the Empre&s;s <HI>Belly&s;ant,</HI> accompanied with her &s;ervant <HI>Blan|diman,</HI> &s;peedily ha&s;ted to hor&s;e. Being thus mounted, and then pa&s;&s;ing through this fair City towards one of the gates thereof, there met her people in great multitudes, of all degrees, much lamenting the lo&s;s of &s;o fair a Lady, and &s;o lovely an Empre&s;s. When &s;he came to the utmo&s;t part, even ready to go out of the gates of the City, there was heard &s;uch a lamentable howling of mournful voices, that the like was never heard in the City of <HI>Con&s;tantinople.</HI> When &s;he was out of the walls of the City, and but newly entred into the wide Fields, &s;he began to fall in|to a womanly fit of bitter w&eacute;eping, to &s;ee how &s;hamefully and di&s;|honourably &s;he was handled, cau&s;ele&s;s. Again, to think upon her birth, and the imperial dignity from whence &s;he was fallen, as al&s;o to account the misfortune wherein &s;he was like to fini&s;h the re&s;t of her days, it drave her at la&s;t from tears, to utter her griefs in the&s;e words: Alas, in what unhappy hour was I born, to fall from &s;o high e&s;tate, to &s;o low an object of poverty as I am now in: Woe is me, the unhappie&s;t among women: now are all my joys turned top&s;y turvy, my laughter is turned into Weeping, my &s;ongs converted into fighs: in&s;tead of cloath of Gold, where|with I was wont to be cloathed, now I am glad of all manner of mean attire: my precious &s;tones of ine&s;timable value, are all taken from me, and Pearls of Tears &s;tand over all my garments. O you fields and woods, to you I make my moan, for other company I have none, con&s;ider my exile, and help to bewail my misfortune: O would the Gods had pittied my di&s;tre&s;s, and made me the poore&s;t among Creatures, then had not Fortune given me &s;o foul a fall, at lea&s;t my poor e&s;tate would never have grived me. Wherefore doth the beauteous Sun &s;end forth his beams upon a wretch &s;o mi&s;erable? Why doth the earth bear &s;uch a Creature, that is all compo&s;ed of cala|mities: It is not po&s;&s;ible for my Tongue to tell out my hearts
<PB N="15" REF="12"> &s;orrow. O wretched man (what&s;oever thou art) that by thy wick|ed trea&s;on hath brought me to this downfall, I may well cur&s;e thee with bitterne&s;s of heart, for by thee onely am I made thus unfortunate. Ah, my Brother, what &s;houlde&s;t thou do with &s;uch a woful Weight to thy Si&s;ter? It had been better I had never been born, than that I &s;hould prove &s;uch a &s;tain to thy Kingly hou&s;e. As &s;he was thus complaining to her &s;ecret heart, the an|gui&s;h thereof &s;truck her into a &s;wound, as &s;he &s;at on hor&s;e-back, and was ready at that in&s;tant to have fallen off her hor&s;e, ere her &s;ervant could alight and recover her, but he u&s;ed all the &s;peedie&s;t means for her recovery, at la&s;t &s;he coming unto her &s;elf again, he &s;aid unto her: Alas Madam, be not &s;o di&s;comforted, neither let de&s;pair &s;o far &s;eize upon you, but tru&s;t ye that the Gods will keep and defend you, for they are ready to aid and a&s;i&s;t the innocent. Having thus &s;poken, he &s;uddainly &s;pied a fountain, towards the which he and his Lady took their way, and being come near there|unto, he &s;et her down thereby, to ea&s;e and refre&s;h her long over|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="2 letters">red &s;en&s;es.

<HEAD>CHAP. IV. How the Arch-prie&s;t put on h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">m the habit of a Knight at Arms, and being well mounted, followed the Empre&s;s Belly&s;ant, who was lately Bani&s;hed.</HEAD>
<P>THe Arch-Prie&s;t having now wrought the bani&s;hment of fair <HI>Belly&s;ant,</HI> thought with him&s;elf now he &s;hould &s;urely accom|pli&s;h his de&s;ire: wherefore in all ha&s;te he changed his White Rochet into a Coat of Steel, and begirt unto his &s;ide a Sword, and being thus accoutred, he &s;uddenly was mounted upon a Milk-White Steed, the faire&s;t that could be had in all <HI>Con|&s;tantinople.</HI> Being thus mounted, he made after with all ex|pedition, inquiring of all he met, which way the Lady <HI>Belly&s;ant</HI>
<PB N="16" REF="13"> was taken, who gladly told him which way &s;he lately pa&s;&s;ed. Af|ter &s;ome few hours Riding, at la&s;t he came to a great &s;paci|ous Forre&s;t, and very long, taking the direct way towards the Lady: It chanced that as he was riding forward, ca&s;ting his eye a&s;ide, he pre&s;ently e&s;pied the Lady with her Servant <HI>Blandiman,</HI> &s;itting by a Fountain, but &s;uddenly withdrew him&s;elf, and coming nearer, found the Lady &s;itting by the &s;ame, full of heavine&s;s, la|menting her mi&s;erable fortunes, and by her &s;at her tru&s;ty Servant comforting her.</P>
<P>This fal&s;e Prie&s;t, from forth his Beaver, well perceived it to be the Lady, but by rea&s;on of his di&s;gui&s;e, &s;he could not imagine him to be the Arch-Prie&s;t, her Enemy: but coming nearer her, &s;he &s;oon di&s;cryed him, and being &s;truck with a &s;udden fear, &s;pake thus to her Servant: Alas (quoth &s;he) I well perceive this to be the fal&s;e Arch-Prie&s;t, that thus cometh towards us, of whom I am exceeding fearful, le&s;t he be come to do me further villany. Lady (quoth <HI>B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">andiman</HI>) bani&s;h fear, for if he come after us to do you further harm, I will encounter him body for body, even as long as life la&s;teth. By this time that they had ended their &s;peech each to other, the Arch-Prie&s;t was ready to a light from his Hor&s;e, to &s;alute the Lady in all courteous behaviour: and after he had made him&s;elf known unto her, he began to &s;ay unto her after this manner:</P>
<P>Right dear Lady, and our late honored Empre&s;s, &s;ithy thy ca&s;e is &s;o pitiful, as to &s;uffer bani&s;hment by Sentence given again&s;t thee by the Emperor, &s;o it is, that if thou wilt give me enter|tainment in thy Love, accept me into thy favour, and to grant what I have long &s;ought at thy hands, I will bring it to pa&s;s that the Emperor &s;hall again recal thy bani&s;hment, and make thy greatne&s;s of State, &s;hine more bright then ever before: there|fore advi&s;e you well, for I prote&s;t what I offer to you, is only ten|ding to your good and advancement. Ha (quoth the Lady) thou di&s;loyal and traiterous adver&s;ary, I have no great cau&s;e to be&s;tow love, where my life hath been put in jeoparday. It is onely thou that ha&s;t wrought my overthrow, &amp; thou it is, that make&s;t me to &s;pend the remnant of my days in more mi&s;ery then ever Lady is able to indure. Lady (quoth he) utter not forth &s;uch cur&s;es again&s;t
<PB N="17" REF="13"> me, for I am come to you, not to vex or trouble you, but to heap upon you more joys than ever you as yet; in all your life enjoyed; and in &s;peaking the&s;e words he bended his body to the Lady, think|ing to have ki&s;&s;ed her; but <HI>Blandiman</HI> perceiving his intent, &s;ud|denly &s;tarted between them, and gave the Arch-Prie&s;t &s;o mighty a &s;troak that he felled him to the earth, and with the violence of the blow, brake out one of his teeth. The Arch-Prie&s;t had no &s;ooner recovered him&s;elf from the ground, but &s;uddenly betook him to his &s;word, which <HI>Blandiman</HI> perceiving, betook him to a Glave which he had about him, whereupon grew a &s;ore and dan|gerous fight between them.</P>
<P>This incounter la&s;ted &s;o long that they were both wounded, but &s;till they continued fighting, till at la&s;t it chanced, a Merchant came by that way, who perceiving a far off their fierce encounter, cryed out with a loud voice, in this manner: Lords, Lords, quoth he, leave off, and &s;hew the cau&s;e of this your variance, and I &s;hall do my be&s;t to end this controver&s;ie. Sir, (quoth <HI>Blandiman</HI>) let us fir&s;t try our right by our weapons, and afterwards we will be ruled by words. But the poor Lady could no longer bear &s;ilence, but began to tell the Merchant as followeth. Alas (quoth &s;he) as you ever pittyed woman, pitty my ca&s;e, for this man, whom here you &s;ee armed, is the fal&s;e and traiterous Arch-Prie&s;t, that hath followed me to rob me of mine Honour, and force me to his wicked and un&s;atiate Lu&s;t: Al&s;o, this is he that hath made a &s;epe|ration between me and the Emperor my Lord and Husband. The Merchant hearing her lamentable tale, pittyed her mi&s;ery, and began thus unto the Arch-Prie&s;t; Sir Prie&s;t, leave off your enter|prize, and dare not &s;o much as to touch this innocent Lady, for if the Emperor did but under&s;tand this villany, he would &s;oon end thy life in infamy, as thou well de&s;erve&s;t. As &s;oon as the Arch-Prie&s;t had heard his &s;peech he for&s;ook his combate, and fled as fa&s;t as he could through the wood, for fear of being further known, being prevented of his purpo&s;e toward the Lady: though he con|veied his body out of &s;ight, yet his villanies were afterwards di&s;|clo&s;ed. After his departure the Lady was forced to &s;tay &s;till in the wood all &s;orrowful, with her wounded &s;ervant. The Merchant &s;taid with them &s;ome little time, bewailing the hard hap of the

I &s;ee that this Arch-Prie&s;t hath fal&s;ely betrayed you, and brought you in hatred with the Emperor, but I will promi&s;e you, that if I live I will bewray all the&s;e Treacheries to the Emperor, and bring the Traitor to a &s;hameful death, and &s;o taking leave, I commend you to the Gods, wi&s;hing that in the&s;e extremities <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ou would be patient, and com|fort your &s;elf in the&s;e your &s;orrows: &s;o with many thanks for his aid from <HI>Blandiman,</HI> the Merchant departed.</P>
<P>The Merchant having left them, <HI>Blan<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">iman</HI> &s;et the Lady upon her hor&s;e, and him&s;elf on his, &s;o riding on together, they came unto a lodging lying in their way, where they remained eight days, du|ring which time her &s;ervant was recovered of his wounds, and then forward towards <HI>France,</HI> the Lady &s;till &s;orrowful and com|plaining in this manner: Alas <HI>Blandiman,</HI> what may my Brother, and the Peers of <HI>France</HI> think of this, when they &s;hall under&s;tand that I am expelled <HI>Greece</HI> for &s;uch a di&s;honourable deed, and as a common Harlot, bani&s;hed from the Emperor of <HI>Con&s;tantinople?</HI> Alas!

<P><HI>BElly&s;ant</HI> (as before you heard) being with Child, was &s;udden|ly overtaken in the Forre&s;t. The time of her delivery being come cau&s;ed her to for&s;ake her Hor&s;e, and begin to complain to her &s;ervant, on this manner. Alas (quoth &s;he) help, help, I &s;ay,

<P><HI>Blandiman</HI> her &s;ervant did as &s;he commanded, and for that he knew not how to find the &s;ame place again, he &s;et a &s;pecial mark, that he might the readier come thither again: and &s;o betaking him to hor&s;e, he rode forth &s;wiftly to &s;eek &s;ome woman to help this di&s;tre&s;&s;ed Lady.</P>
<P>He being gone, the Lady was left comfortle&s;s all alone with|out &s;uccour of any creature, &s;o that at la&s;t &s;he was delivered of two fair Sons in the De&s;olate Forre&s;t. The&s;e Children were no &s;ooner come into the world, but a fre&s;h mi&s;ery wor&s;e than all the

This &s;trange and unlookt for accident, frighted the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed Lady to the &s;oul, that &s;he cryed out mo&s;t la|mentably, getting up upon her hands and feet, to ha&s;ten after the afore&s;aid Bear, which was quickly got out of her &s;ight. But alas! it little availed her to make any further pu &s;uit, for &s;he never came unto the &s;ight of her child, till by miracle it was at length di&s;clo&s;ed.

<P>It hapned the &s;ame day that her Brother King <HI>Pepin</HI> had ta|ken his journey from <HI>P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ris</HI> (accompanied with divers great Lords and Barons) towards <HI>Co&s;tantinople,</HI> to vi&s;it his Si&s;ter <HI>Belly&s;ant,</HI> and &s;triking through <HI>Orleance,</HI> he made &s;uch ha&s;t, that he entred into the &s;ame Forre&s;t whereas his bani&s;hed Si&s;ter was lately de|livered of her two Children, but knowing nothing what had hap|pened.

<P>King <HI>Pepin</HI> having heard the lamentable relation of <HI>Blandimans</HI> report, being exceeding outragious and fierce in anger (and yet &s;orrowful withal) brake out in &s;peech mo&s;t bitterly again&s;t her, on this manner: Now by the Gods, quoth he, I hold the Emperor no upright Iudge, in that he &s;pared the life of my Si&s;ter: for I &s;wear, that if I had her here now in my po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, I would not re&s;t, till by death I had made her an example to all fal&s;e Ladies, while the world endureth: and therewithal commanded all his train of Lords, and others, to &s;tay their journey of going forward, and make their return back again to <HI>Paris,</HI> for the grievous offen|ces of my Si&s;ter, here &s;tays my journey, and &s;o be departed, with|out further asking any more que&s;tions, but turning his hor&s;es head, &s;orrow overcame his courage, and at la&s;t made him break forth into the&s;e words: Ha (quoth he) how many men are deceived in Women? Now am I utterly prevented of all my
<PB N="22" REF="16"> purpo&s;es, for my only hope re&s;ted in the mode&s;ty of my Si&s;ter <HI>Belly&s;ant,</HI> yea and in her &s;tood all my joys and plea&s;ure. Again, to have had the Emperor <HI>Alexander</HI> &s;till my Brother, and fa&s;t friend at all a&s;&s;aies, and in all my nece&s;&s;ities, was my only hope, and joy of heart, and now behold by her I am di&s;appointed, defamed, and &s;hut out into eternal di&s;honour. And &s;o in that di&s;tru&s;t and melancholy, King <HI>Pepin</HI> returned again towards <HI>O leance.</HI> When <HI>Blandiman</HI> perceived the courage of the King to be thus daunted, he dur&s;t relate no further news of the Lady <HI>Belly&s;ant,</HI> but leaving the King took his way towards the Tr&eacute;e, where he lately left her in great pain of Child-birth: being come thither, he &s;ought her every where, but could hear no tydings of her: wherefore being &s;orrowful, he knew not what way to take.</P>
<P>Being in this exta&s;ie, at la&s;t he tyed up his hor&s;e to a thorn-tr&eacute;e, and began again to make a narrower &s;earch than before; wherein he was &s;o vigilant, that anon he e&s;pyed her, finding her flat upon the earth, in a manner &s;p&eacute;echle&s;s, for very grief of heart that &s;he had lo&s;t her Child, which the Bear had violently bore away from her. <HI>Blandiman</HI> being glad, that now at la&s;t he had found her, kindly embraced her, and taking her up in his arms from the cold earth, &s;et her upon her feet, and began thus unto her: Alas, (dear Lady and Mi&s;tre&s;s) how happened you to &s;tray thus far from the place I left you in?</P>
<P>The Lady looking upon him with a gha&s;tly countenance, re|plyed thus: Ah <HI>Blandiman!</HI> my dolors and di&s;tre&s;&s;es daily increa&s;e upon me. For thou wert no &s;ooner departed, to get me the help of &s;ome woman-kind, but I being delivered of two Babes, a Ravenous Bear from the Forre&s;t a&s;&s;ailed me, and bare away one of them. I, although weak, making what poor &s;hift I was able, followed that ravenous Bea&s;t, thinking by &s;trong hand to have recovered again my lo&s;s, but all in vain, I could not overtake the Bear, nor wanting my &s;trength, recover back again to the Tr&eacute;e, where I left my other Infant. Lady (quoth he) the o|ther Infant? why I my &s;elf but lately came from the Tr&eacute;e, and I am well a&s;&s;ured that there lay no Infant there, nor near thereabout. How (quoth the Lady) no Child under the Tree? With the&s;e words &s;he was &s;o inwardly wounded, that &s;he fell down in
<PB N="23" REF="16"> a &s;wound, which <HI>Blandiman</HI> e&s;pying, &s;aved her (in what he could) and fell into brini&s;h tears for grief and &s;orrow, to &s;ee his Lady &s;o extreamly plunged, and overwhelmed, and at la&s;t led her towards the Tree, where &s;he had left the Child, but when &s;he &s;aw that other Child al&s;o gone, think then what dolour of heart the poor Lady endured: in the mid&s;t of all which &s;orrows, &s;he thus be|&s;peak.</P>
<P>Alas (quoth &s;he) can there be in the world a more de&s;olate wretch, on every &s;ide compa&s;&s;ed with grief, yea, and all in&s;up|portable &s;orrows? but alas Emperor, thou art the cau&s;e, and ha&s;t been the only means even to deliver me even to death, and that wrongfully without cau&s;e on my part, and only by deceiveable coun&s;el ha&s;t thou bereft me of thy company; But here I call all the Gods to witne&s;s that I was never faulty to thee in my body, nor di&s;obedient unto thee in any point: wherefore once again I am forced to cry out for vengeance upon the offenders head: who&s;oever. Fir&s;t, for my di&s;grace; next, for my bani&s;hment, and now la&s;tly for the lo&s;s of my two Babes, i&s;&s;ued from the blood Royal of the Emperor of <HI>Con&s;tantinople.</HI> But &s;eeing all the&s;e mi&s;eries have even tyred them&s;elves upon my very heart, Come death, and fini&s;h what &s;orrows do but prolong. All this while <HI>Blandim<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">n</HI> was ear-witne&s;s of all the&s;e piteous plaints, in&s;omuch that he grew even weary of her wailing, and in the be&s;t manner he could, comforted her dying &s;pirits, by falling to in|treat her, that &s;he would &s;omewhat give over her moans, and be|take her &s;elf to her feet: Whereunto &s;he gave con&s;ent, he ac|companied with a Woman he had brought with him, came into a Neighbouring Village, whereas they lodged and nouri&s;hed her, till &s;he had &s;omething recovered her &s;trength, and in &s;ome mea&s;ure forgotten the depth of her mi&s;eries. <HI>Blandiman</HI> began to break with his Lady on this manner: Lady (quoth he) it was my chance in looking you in the woods, to light upon your Brother, King <HI>Pepin,</HI> who demanded of me what tydings? But his brows were bent and full of anger again&s;t you; wherefore Lady, my coun&s;el is, that you make not towards him, for by that countenance I well perceive you &s;hall have but &s;lender welcome. For upon further que&s;tions demanded, and an&s;wered, &s;o &s;oon as he heard me tell
<PB N="24" REF="17"> that the Emperor had exiled you, he lightly gave credit that yours was the fault, and therefore he lays all the blame on you. O! (quoth the Lady) now what I mo&s;t feared is come to pa&s;s, and I well perceive that I am be&s;et with adver&s;aries on every &s;ide: Well, be it as it may be, the Emperor hath exiled me without cau&s;e, what then &s;hall I do? I will never return again to <HI>Paris,</HI> but take my way into &s;ome remote Land, where my body with my faults &s;hall be &s;mothered: For my Brothers anger is grown &s;o great, that he could willingly deliver me over to death; there|fore it is better to flye and to &s;ave my life, then fall into the fury of &s;o angry a Brother. This doleful &s;peech &s;he delivered in tears, which <HI>Blandiman</HI> perceiving, &s;aid unto her: Lady leave off your tears, for be a&s;&s;ured of my faithful &s;ervice, and here I offer my &s;elf, life, and all to be at your &s;ervice; go whither you plea&s;e. Why then (quoth the Lady) &s;ince thou art &s;o re&s;olute, let us re&s;olve upon &s;ome &s;trange adventure, and therewithal pa&s;&s;ed forth to expo&s;e them&s;elves to future dangers; where now we &s;hall be forced to leave them with &s;orrowful hearts, and return again to &s;peak &s;omething of the Bear, that carried away one of the Chil|dren.</P>

This child by rea&s;on of the nou|ri&s;hment it received from the Bear, became rough all over like a bea&s;t, and as he grew in &s;trength, began to range up and down in the Woods, and when he met with other bea&s;ts would finite them, and got &s;uch Ma&s;tery over them, that they began to &s;hun the place wherein he came, he was &s;o extream fierce among&s;t them, and in this bea&s;t-like E&s;tate pa&s;&s;ed he the term of fif|teen years, growing up to &s;uch &s;trength, that &s;carce any man or bea&s;t in the forre&s;t dur&s;t &s;tir abroad, fearing to fall into his hands, le&s;t he &s;hould put them to death and after eat their fle&s;h, more like unto a ravenous bea&s;t, than any humane Creature.

<P><HI>ALexander</HI> the Emperor, having &s;hamefully expelled <HI>Belly|&s;ant</HI> his Wife, Si&s;ter to King <HI>Pepin,</HI> oftentimes repented him of the fact: but by the cur&s;ed Coun&s;el of the Arch-Prie&s;t, un|to who&s;e Words the Emperor gave &s;uch credit continually that what he &s;pake was an Oracle in the ears of the &s;aid Emperor: In&s;omuch as he continually heaped new Honours upon that Traiterous Prie&s;t, advancing him even above the highe&s;t in his Empire, and what&s;oever he commanded, was effected. At la&s;t, having gotten all power and authority into his hands, he bagan to inhance the cu&s;tomes and taxes of the City of <HI>Con|&s;tantinople,</HI> which exactions of his again&s;t all rea&s;on, &s;truck even to the very hearts of the Inhabitants. Among the re&s;idue of the&s;e his forced impo&s;itions, (it happened that according to their yearly cu&s;tomes) there were held a great Mart in the City, which falls out about the month of <HI>Sep<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ember.</HI> Hereunto re&s;orted many people for divers occa&s;ions, e&s;pecially Merchants. The Fair or Mart-day being come, the Emperor gave the charge thereof unto this Arch-Prie&s;t, who accordingly provided him&s;elf, and to the &s;ame purpo&s;e armed 200 men to guard his own per&s;on: being thus accompained, he took his wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter"> into the City, to effect this new charge which the Emperor had &s;o lately be&s;towed upon him.

Now mark what followed: This Merchant among the re&s;t, was richly furni&s;hed with all rich and co&s;tly wares as Cloath of Gold, Silver Silk, &amp;c. where|by he received great wealth, and took more money than any five Merchants be&s;ide. The Fair being ended the Arch-Prie&s;t &s;ent forth his officers, to demand and receive his accu&s;tomed duties due upon the &s;ale of tho&s;e Merchandizes. The officers came unto this Merchant, and &s;aid, Sir, you mu&s;t pay ten pence on every pound that you have taken, for &s;o it is ordained by the great offi|cer to whom it doth belong.</P>
<P>The Merchant hereat being angry, &s;aid, cur&s;ed be that di&s;loy|al Arch-Prie&s;t, for he is the only cau&s;e of the&s;e new rai&s;ed exacti|ons upon us: It had been good for all men, if he had long &s;ince had his de&s;ert, and with &s;hame and infamy had ended his Days: At which reproachful words again&s;t the Arch-Prie&s;t, the Officer took his &s;taff and &s;mote the Merchant on the head, that pre&s;ently the blood gu&s;hed out. Then the Merchant feeling the blood about his ears, drew his &s;word and &s;truck &s;o ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">d upon the Officer, that he laid him at his feet for dead.

The Emperor did as he reque&s;tev: then &s;aid the Merchant with a loud voice, Lords, Barons, and Knights, all you that love the honor of the Empe|ror, and the Triumphant Reign of his per&s;on, attend my words: For the time is come that the Trea&s;on of the cur&s;ed Arch-Prie&s;t will now be revealed and come to light. Then thus great Empe|ror, this is that cur&s;ed man whom you have ever nouri&s;hed, and brought to great honor, who hath deceived your tru&s;t; for he it is that hath wrought all the di&s;cord, betwixt you and your vertu|ous Lady, whom you have bani&s;hed both from your Bed, Court, and Country, and by whom you have received more di&s;honor than ever he reaped honor from you: For it had b&eacute;en his part mo&s;t of any to have nouri&s;hed and advanced your Renown, and to have pre&s;erved your honor, but contrarily he hath made my Dread Lord infamous by the&s;e his wicked projects, &amp; brought upon you great &s;candal among all Nations: for he &s;ecretly and onder-hand made love to your Empre&s;s, but &s;he denyed him: the which he perceiving, that there was no likelihood to accompli&s;h his de&s;ire, it drove him into a thou&s;and fears, le&s;t this his di&s;loyal act &s;hould come to light: and therefore devi&s;ed to fal&s;ifie unto your ears, her faithful love unto your Bed. Of all which his fal&s;e accu&s;ati|ons, I &s;ay here before you, and all your Lords and Barons, that he lyeth like a Traitor, &amp; for the more approbation of what I have uttered, I will here unfold the truth of what the&s;e eyes of mine were witne&s;&s;es.</P>
<PB N="30" REF="20">
<P>It &s;o happened on a day (after the bani&s;hment of the Empre&s;s <HI>Belly&s;ant</HI>) as I was riding about my affairs, I chanced to tra|vel through a wood: at la&s;t pa&s;&s;ing along the way, I found this treacherous Prie&s;t transformed out of the habit of his Prie&s;thood, into the &s;hape of a Knight, even armed at all points ready for the combate with the enemy. Drawing nearer and nearer, I might behold him in fight with another man unarmed, which at la&s;t I found to be <HI>Blandiman,</HI> Squire to the bani&s;hed Lady, who con|ducted her in the time of her exile.</P>
<P>Ill perceiving they encountred one another &s;o-fiercely, be|gan to call unto them, to give over their direful fight: but they little regarded what I &s;aid: I did perceive the Lady piteou&s;ly weeping, and at la&s;t &s;aid unto me thus: Gentle Merchant, and kind friend, lend me thy aid again&s;t this treacherous Arch-Prie&s;t, that &s;eeketh by force to rob me of mine honour. This is he, and onely he, by whom I am bani&s;hed from my Emperors Bed and Country. With that I put &s;purs to m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter"> hor&s;e, and ran between them to &s;eperate them, which this Arch-Prie&s;t percei|ving, &s;uddenly fled into the Wood, being full a&s;&s;ured that I had knowledge who he was. Noble Emperor it had been my part to have revealed this long before, but I dur&s;t not open my Mouth unto you, for fear his greatne&s;s would have out-&s;wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ed my truth, and &s;o have brought my &s;elf unto an untimely death.</P>
<P>The Emperor having heard this tale, &s;ighed, and at la&s;t fell into tears: in which tears he turned him unto the Arch-Prie&s;t, relating his di&s;loyalty in this manner: Ah thou fal&s;e &s;ervant (quoth he) have I ever &s;tudied to do thee honor, and exalt th&eacute;e to high dignities, and ha&s;t thou quitted all my love and tru&s;t with di&s;loy|alty and trea&s;ons? Well, I have &s;een now what I ever mi&s;tru&s;t|ed, thou ha&s;t made me of all men mo&s;t unhappy. But it is not &s;o much thy fault as my own, thy trea&s;on hath bewitched me: In an evil hour I gave credit to thy fal&s;e &s;peaking tongue, and thereby de&s;erve to carry the brand of my own folly.</P>
<P>The Arch-Prie&s;t hearing the Emperor thus di&s;tempered, began to intreat his Highne&s;s not to be &s;o impatient, neither to give credit to this &s;landerous tale that the Merchant had commenced again&s;t him: for (quoth he) he be lyeth me, and I am no way guil|ty
<PB N="31" REF="20"> of that wherewith he accu&s;eth me: thou lye&s;t fal&s;ly (quoth the Merchant) thou can&s;t not excu&s;e thy &s;elf in what I have charged thee withal, and if thou &s;tand &s;till in the denyal, I challenge thee by the &s;ingle Combate, to maintain the truth, and try my Ouar|rel: and hereupon, I throw down my gage, and withal tender my body thereunto, for to make good what I have here &s;poken: and more than that, ere night &s;hut in, I will deliver thy body to death, or yeild my &s;elf vanqui&s;hed.</P>
<P>The Emperor &s;eeing the Merchant &s;o re&s;olute, and to &s;tand to the tryal of the combate, he &s;aid: Arch-Prie&s;t, it is time that either thou quit thy &s;elf by an&s;wering this challenge, or to yeild thy &s;elf guilty of what hath been laid to thy charge. The Arch-Prie&s;t re|plied on this manner: Mighty Emperor, I mu&s;t let you under|&s;tand, that to an&s;wer the Merchants challenge, or take up Arms, is contrary to my place and calling, for I am a &s;acred Prelate of the Church, and therefore I may refu&s;e to fight. Nay (quoth the Emperor) in this ca&s;e no excu&s;e is to be admitted, but you mu&s;t ei|ther fight, or yeild your &s;elf a Traitor to our Crown and dignity. At the&s;e words the Arch-Prie&s;t was &s;omewhat troubled in mind, yet at la&s;t he was fain to accept the Combate, becau&s;e the Empe|ror charged him &s;o deeply: and be&s;ides, he could have no excu&s;e ad|mitted. So the Emperor commanded them both to &s;afe keeping, till &s;uch time he had &s;ent Letters to King <HI>Pepin</HI> of <HI>France:</HI> but in conclu&s;ion the Traitor had his de&s;art, as hereafter followeth.</P>

The Emperor hearing of his coming, com|manded all the Bells to be rung, and made triumphe to welcome him, for all were filled with joy at his approach. The Emperor mounted on hor&s;e-back, richly accompanied, marched out of the City to meet his Brother King. At la&s;t they met, but the Em|peror overcome with &s;orrow and tears at the remembrance of <HI>Belly&s;ant,</HI> could not utter a Word. On the other &s;ide, <HI>Pepin</HI> being fiercely angred at what happened to his Si&s;ter, gave no re&s;pect unto the Emperors tears, but proudly began to gird him on this manner; Emperor (quoth he) leave off the&s;e your lamentations, and &s;hake off the&s;e weeds of &s;orrow that you &s;eem to wear for my Si&s;ter <HI>Belly&s;ant;</HI> for he that hath a harlot unto his wife, I account him mad to grieve at her misbehaviour, and &s;ince my Si&s;ter hath proved &s;uch a one, let her go and take care for her &s;elf, &s;he is not worthy of &s;o much as one tear from &s;uch an eye of Maje&s;ty.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IX. How the Merchant and the High-prie&s;t encountred at the place appointed, about the clearing of the Lady Belly&s;ant, and what a glorious victory did betide the Merchant.</HEAD>
<P>NOw was the day appointed come for the Combat between the Arch-Prie&s;t and the Merchant: wherefore every thing was made in readine&s;s, according to the command of the Empe|ror. At la&s;t there came both the Combatants into the field, and pre&s;ented them&s;elves before the Emperor. Being both before the Emperor, his Attendants, (Knights, and others;) and the Arch-Prie&s;t, armed in a mo&s;t &s;umptuous Armor of proof, all imbo&s;t
<PB N="35" REF="22"> with gold and pearl, which made &s;uch a glittering &s;hew, that it even dazed the eyes of the beholders. Being thus richly armed, the Arch-Prie&s;t came forth into the field, and took his place appointed him, at the one end of the Li&s;t, appointed for that purpo&s;e. The Emperor beholding the glorious &s;hew that the Arch-Prie&s;t made in his Arms, called forth the Merchant, cau&s;ing him fir&s;t to kn&eacute;e! down, &amp; in the pre&s;ence of the a&s;&s;embly, dubbed him Knight. Then commanded he that a mo&s;t rich Armor &s;hould be put upon him in the pre&s;ence of the Emperor, who during the time he was Arming, promi&s;ed unto this Merchant, if he overcame the Arch-Prie&s;t, to advance him in great livings, and high authority. The&s;e two adver&s;aries being now in readine&s;s, and each having their Blazon about their neck, their Hor&s;es were brought forth, and they proudly mounted, ready to give battle: the Emperor gave &s;traight charge unto all his Officers of arms to have a &s;pecial e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">e unto the Arch-Prie&s;t, for fear le&s;t he on the &s;udden &s;hould flye the field, or run away from them, as they would an&s;wer it with their lives. The Merchant thus mounted, and his &s;word girt to him, fir&s;t entred y^e Li&s;ts, after whom entred &s;uch abundance of people, that they were numberle&s;s. Then after came the Arch-Prie&s;t, &s;umptuou&s;ly accompanied with Nobles and Knights of great honour and dignity. The Combatants thus both entred the Li&s;ts, ready to charge one another, King <HI>Pepin</HI> was there in per&s;on, called out aloud unto the Merchant, &s;aying unto him: My friend, the Gods give thee victory again&s;t this fal&s;e Traitor. I vow unto th&eacute;e here before this great a&s;&s;embly (&s;o I may but find out the truth of my Si&s;ter <HI>Belly&s;ant,</HI>) notwith&s;tanding the great advancement that the Emperor hath promi&s;ed, to take thee into <HI>France,</HI> and make thee companion with the be&s;t of my Kingdom.

Then came a Herauld, admini&s;tring to them both an oath, and &s;o clear|ing the Li&s;ts, left the Champions to their fortunes.</P>
<P>Now are both the Combatants read<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter"> to &s;et forth, and the Mar|&s;hals of the field brought each of them a Spear, which they no &s;ooner had received, but they put &s;purs to their Hor&s;es, and ran

</FIGURE> with &s;uch violence together, that their Spears were broken to their hands. Then they began to &s;et forward to another cour&s;e, charging each other with their &s;words, in &s;uch violent manner, that with their fury they redounded from their Armor to the ground cutting off whole quarters of their Cor&s;lets, and left them as a prey for tho&s;e that attended the fight.</P>
<P>The Arch-Prie&s;t &s;&eacute;eing him&s;elf &s;o &s;tifly matched, gave over the fight till towards the evening (for &s;uch was the cu&s;tom of the Country, that in any challenged Combate either party might refu&s;e to follow the fight &s;o eagerly, but that they might have a breathing time, &s;o the Combate were yielded vanqui&s;hed before Sun-&s;et, or el&s;e abide the &s;entence of death) thinking thereby to weary out the Merchant. Which the Merchant being privy unto, &s;o behaved him&s;elf, that he prepared to receive the Arch-Prie&s;t couragiou&s;ly when he encountred him; in&s;omuch that when they come together to make tryal of their valor, and to get conque&s;t,

The Arch-Prie&s;t perceiving his enemy unarmed, he put &s;purs to his hor&s;e, and charged him with &s;uch violence, that he ran again&s;t the Merchants hor&s;e and thru&s;t out one of his eyes: the hor&s;e feeling him&s;elf hurt, ran up and down as mad, leaping and curvetting &s;o furiou&s;ly that he unhor&s;ed his rider, and &s;o hard was the fortune of the Merchant, that in his fall, his foot hung fa&s;t in the &s;tirrop, whereby he was brought into great danger, the hor&s;e hurrying him along the field, that all were very &s;orrowful to behold this lamentable &s;pectacle, and with the amazement thereof grew de&s;perate in their hopes; King <HI>Pepin</HI> al&s;o was &s;ore di&s;cou|raged at this di&s;a&s;terous chance, that the tears did even trickle down his cheeks, and in a &s;ilent &s;peech to him&s;elf, thus he &s;pake. Alas Merchant, I now well perceive thy days are at an end, and that the tru&s;t I repo&s;ed in thee is utterly fru&s;trate: for by thy fall I &s;ee my Si&s;ters cha&s;tity to be weak; and the rather, for that the Gods hath &s;uffered th&eacute;e to fall &s;o unluckily this day; &s;o that I mu&s;t needs confe&s;s that the Emperor hath done well in expul&s;ing her his Kingdom: Oh, that her day of birth, had proved her day of bu|rial, it had been happy for her, but thrice happier to me, for only by her is the blood Royal of <HI>France</HI> brought into great infamy: and were it &s;o, I had her at my di&s;po&s;e, I would be the fir&s;t man &s;hould &s;ee execution done upon her, even to death.</P>
<P>Now, that which was &s;o miraculous, was, all this time that the Merchant was dragged up and down the field, the Arch-Prie&s;t could not inforce his Hor&s;e to come up unto the Merchant; but fled out too and fro, whereby he could not make a prey upon the Merchant, as he thought to have done. But &s;ee, at the la&s;t the Merchants Hor&s;e, that had thus drawn him up and down the field, foundred and fell down, which gave great advantage to the Merchant, who with that fall got his Leg from forth the &s;tirrop, and at la&s;t got up on his feet, like a valiant and hardy Champion. The Arch-Prie&s;t perceiving the Merchant had recovered his legs, came running with &s;trong violence upon him, and thereby lent him five or &s;ix &s;ore blows upon his head and &s;houlders, that the
<PB N="38" REF="24"> poor Merchant was even a &s;tonied. At la&s;t, he was forced to give back to recover breath, and in a very little &s;pace, finding him&s;elf &s;omewhat relieved, he &s;ubtilly and fiercely gave a fre&s;h a&s;&s;ault upon the Arch-Prie&s;t, again&s;t whom he &s;truck with &s;uch violence, that the &s;word fell out of his hand, but he had fir&s;t &s;o wounded the Arch-Prie&s;t, that the blood ran quite through his armor upon the earth. This &s;o vexed the Arch-Prie&s;t, that he grew mad with rage, and turned his hor&s;e upon the Merchant, minding to have over|run him with his hor&s;e. But the Merchant perceiving his drift, prepared to receive him, and therewithal drew a long knife, and panched it into the belly of the hor&s;e, &s;o that the hor&s;e being thus wounded, began to fling and leap, in&s;omuch as the Arch-Prie&s;t was in danger to be unhor&s;t, and doing what he could to &s;ave him|&s;elf, he lo&s;t his Shield. The Merchant e&s;pyed him thus unarmed, ran ha&s;tily and caught up the Shield, and threw it away, &s;o that he could no more recover it: that done, he made again towards his hor&s;e, and &s;mote him into the belly with his &s;word, &s;o that by this time, both the hor&s;e and his rider came tumbling down upon the ground.</P>
<P>The Arch-Prie&s;t being thus unhor&s;t, was very nimble to reco|ver him&s;elf, but yet the Merchant watching all opportunity, lent him &s;uch a blow, that as he began to ri&s;e, he laid him flat again upon the ground, and then leaped upon him, pulled off his helmet, thinking to have &s;mitten off his head, when the Arch-Prie&s;t &s;aw him&s;elf thus vanqui&s;hed, he was exceeding wroth, but &s;eeing little availed, he &s;aid thus unto the Merchant: Alas, my Friend, I be|&s;&eacute;ech thee take mercy upon me, and while I am yet living, give me &s;ome time to confe&s;s my &s;elf, that I may free my &s;oul of dan|ger, for to thee I yield my &s;elf as vanqui&s;hed. The Merchant hearing him &s;ay &s;o, was very courteous, and granted him his de&s;ire. The Prie&s;t had no &s;ooner gotten on his feet, but he for&s;ook his confe&s;&s;ion, and &s;uddenly got the Merchant in his arms and threw him on the ground, and leapt upon him in mo&s;t &s;udden out|rage, &s;aying thus to the Merchant, I have th&eacute;e now at advantage, and from my hands thou &s;halt not e&s;cape with life, if what I &s;hall command thee thou do not effect. Ha! replyed the Merchant, ha&s;t thou thus betrayed me. Well, it is &s;o, that now I &s;tand at thy

The Merchant had no &s;ooner got on his feet, but he began again a fre&s;h to open all the Trea&s;on of the Arch-Prie&s;t, even to his teeth, and again he took courage, and now would requite him in the &s;ame &s;wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">e he had &s;erved him before: and &s;uddenly he cla&s;p|ing the Arch-Prie&s;t in his arms, he threw him down, and having him at advantage, he &s;aid thus: Arch-Prie&s;t; you have taught me to pla<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter"> my part, and therefore think no more upon confe&s;&s;ions, for you &s;hall confe&s;s to me or none.

<PB N="40" REF="25"> the Merchant not regarding his words, pre&s;ently put out his eys, and gave him &s;o many deadly blows, that he made him &s;ure enough for ri&s;ing to do him any harm.

<P>The Mar&s;hals did according to the reque&s;t of the Merchant, and then pre&s;ently came King <HI>Alexander</HI> the Emperor, with King <HI>Pepin,</HI> and all the Nobles, even to the place where the Arch-Prie&s;t lay all &s;orrowful, and fully vanqui&s;hed. Then the Empe|ror demanded of him the truth of the matter, which the Arch-Pre&s;t confe&s;&s;ed, declaring the whole plot of his villanies, and how by his means the Lady <HI>Belly&s;ant</HI> had been wrongfully bani&s;h|ed. When the &s;tanders by heard all the whole matter, a multitude of tears were &s;hed on every &s;ide, but e&s;pecially the Emperor, for his lamentations were &s;o violent, that all that were about him wept with great bitterne&s;s and hearty &s;orrow.

<P>At la&s;t, lamentations was laid apart: when they had heard all the confe&s;&s;ions of the Arch-Prie&s;ts Trea&s;ons; The Emperor con|&s;ulted with his coun&s;el that the Traitor &s;hould be put into a Caldron of hot burning oyl, quick, and &s;o fini&s;h his mi&s;erable days, as he had traiterou&s;ly &s;ought the life of that innocent La|dy:

<P>KIng <HI>Pepin</HI> having taken his leave, from <HI>Con&s;tantinople</HI> (as you have heard) after a long journey, arrived in <HI>France,</HI> and &s;o to <HI>Orleance,</HI> to refre&s;h his long &amp; tyred &s;pirits, to&s;&s;ed too and fro

<P>In the mid&s;t of their I ca&s;tings and Revellings, the E&s;quire that had the charge of the Orphan <HI>Valentine,</HI> took and pre&s;ented him before the King, &s;aying unto his Maje&s;ty on this manner: Dread Soveraign, Lo, here I pre&s;ent before you the poor Or|phan that your Maje&s;ty found in the Forre&s;t of <HI>Orleance,</HI> and the &s;ame Child which you commanded me to &s;ee brought up, not at mine expence, Dread Soveraign, but at your own. My Leige, the rea&s;on why I make tender of him unto you at this time, is, becau&s;e he is growing to mans e&s;tate; and &s;o may it plea&s;e your Maje&s;ty, it is time to di&s;po&s;e of him as you plea&s;e: The King ha|ving heard the words of the E&s;quire, called this Orphan (named <HI>Valentine</HI>) unto him, and took him by the hand, and moved divers que&s;tions unto him, all which he an&s;wered with much mode&s;ty, and great wi&s;dom, and being ravi&s;hed therewith, commanded that all his Cupbord of Plate &s;hould be given unto him. More|over (&s;aid the King) I command that this Orphan <HI>Valentine</HI> be dearly pre&s;erved &amp; kept, for that you &s;hall perceive I re&s;pect him above common love, I will al&s;o, that this Infant &s;hall be nouri&s;h|ed &amp; kept with my Daughter <HI>Eglantine,</HI> &s;he is both fair, wi&s;e, and well endowed with all the riche&s;t gifts of Nature.</P>
<P>The King having given this command, it was accordingly ac|compli&s;hed, in&s;omuch that they were both under one government of one and the &s;ame Nur&s;e, and had one and the &s;ame attendants: yea, every way they joyed one in the company of the other, in &s;uch wi&s;e, that if the one was but a little ab&s;ent from the other, there was a kind of lamentation till they came together again: but e&s;pecially the Kings daughter, who &s;o pondred on the prudent carriages of the Orphan, that &s;he became in love with him, in&s;omuch as his ab&s;ence brought her into a thou&s;and fears, and
<PB N="43" REF="26"> drave her melancholly thoughts into a thou&s;and doubts.</P>
<P>Now <HI>Valentine</HI> was ever practi&s;ing him&s;elf in &s;eats of Arms, as Hor&s;e, Armor, Iu&s;ts, and Turnaments, &s;till expo&s;ing him|&s;elf to all dangers what&s;oever. The King wi&s;ely beholding the inclination of this youth, allotted unto him what his heart de&s;i|red, furni&s;hed him with Armor, Hor&s;e, Lands, Revenues, and made him Lord of rich po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions. Being thus furni&s;hed, there aro&s;e within the Court many &s;ecret mutterings, whereby many fret|ted &s;o &s;ore in envy towards him, that they uttered forth many re|proachful words again&s;t him, &s;a ing, that when he was at the be&s;t, he was but a found &s;tra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">, poor, ba&s;e, without any known Parents or Friends, of no gentle or noble &s;tock and &s;uch like: which when <HI>Valentine</HI> heard, he could take no other revenge, but &s;it him down and weep: who&s;e tears fair <HI>Eglantine</HI> perceiving, would in a ten|der woman-like affection accompany him, even pouring forth her tears al&s;o for company.</P>
<P>At length when he &s;aw tears little availed, he began to for&s;ake it, and taking heart, bore him&s;elf like a man, amid&s;t the greate&s;t in the Court, carrying him&s;elf in &s;uch humble and gentle frame, that he gained the love of all &s;orts, and degrees, as well Nobles, as Inferiours.</P>
<P><HI>Valentine</HI> thus growing up in love of the Court, all this while his Brother <HI>Or&s;on</HI> runs in the Forre&s;t, all rough and covered with hair like a Bear, and leading the life of a Bea&s;t, where we leave him for a while, and return unto the affairs of King <HI>Pepin.</HI> It &s;o chanced, that there came unto <HI>Orleance</HI> divers Amba&s;&s;a|dors from the Pope, demanding aid again&s;t the <HI>Sarazens,</HI> enemies of the holy faith, who had lately taken the City of <HI>Rome</HI> by vio|lence: King <HI>Pepin</HI> under&s;tanding hereof by divers Letters recei|ved addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf, &amp; his powers to make re&s;i&s;tance again&s;t this common enemy.

Having thus ended his &s;peech, away he goes, leaving the poor Lady all heavy, de&s;o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ate, and in the mid&s;t of mourning.</P>
<P>By this time, the King and all his Powers were in a readine&s;s to depart, and taking their way from <HI>Orleance</HI> towards <HI>Rome,</HI> they went through a mighty Forre&s;t, and being entred, the King called his Lords and Barons together, and &s;aid thus unto them. My Lords it is not unknown unto you, that in the&s;e Woods (as report goeth) there liveth a &s;trange mon&s;ter, a Wild-man, much feared of Pa&s;&s;engers, which &s;pectacle of mans &s;hape, I long to behold, before I venture out any further upon our intended voy|age to <HI>Rome.</HI> The Lords generally con&s;ented, and the cha&s;e was &s;uddenly appointed. Being entred the Wood, they cha&s;ed divers &s;orts of Wild-bea&s;ts, and overcame them: but as for <HI>Or&s;on</HI> the Wild-man, none dur&s;t adventure the finding forth of him, &s;ave onely his Brother <HI>Valentine</HI> (but he knew nothing) &amp; he follow|ed &s;till the cha&s;e, hoping at la&s;t both to find and to fight with him al&s;o. Every way they begirt the Wood, &s;ome one way, &s;ome ano|ther: the King him&s;elf ventured &s;o far, that he came before a Cave, dark, &amp; ob&s;cure, whereas this Wild-man u&s;ed to hide him|&s;elf. <HI>Or&s;on</HI> perceiving the King, ru&s;hed out upon him, caught him within his nails (the which were long and crooked) and in rough and ravenous manner, ca&s;t him on the ground. The King thus

In the mean &s;pace the King e&s;caped, and meeting part of his company, related to them the great danger he had e&s;caped, and the fearful death of the Knight. The&s;e tydings much amazed the re&s;t of the company: yet being manfully re&s;olved, they joyned them&s;elves together, and marched towards the cave to meet with <HI>Or&s;on,</HI> and either to take him alive, or to put him to death in the Cave. But being come thi|ther, they found the Knight dead &amp; torn in peices, but <HI>Or&s;on</HI> they could not find for the Gods had re&s;erved him to be conquered on|ly by his Brother <HI>Valentine:</HI>) of who&s;e proceedings you &s;hall hear more hereafter.</P>
<P>So the King perceiving their labor lo&s;t, gave over the cha&s;e, and &s;et forward towards <HI>Rome.</HI> After this, the King ranked his forces into battel-ray, and the great En&s;ign of <HI>France</HI> was given to one called <HI>Myllan Daugler,</HI> a very valiant Prince, and a wi&s;e-Leader, &s;o that he and his two Brethren, <HI>Gervays</HI> and <HI>Samp&s;on,</HI> had the whole command of the Forces that then were marching towards <HI>Rome.</HI></P>
<P>When they were come unto <HI>Rome,</HI> King <HI>Pepin</HI> de&s;ired battel, and would fain under&s;tand the &s;tate that the City now &s;tood in, un|der the conque&s;t of the <HI>Sarazans,</HI> but it was told him he &s;hould not be too inqui&s;itive of tho&s;e affairs: for the Admiral of the <HI>Sarazens</HI> had &s;urprized the City, and put multitudes to the &s;word, and had &s;poiled and defaced all the Churches, and made them Temples fit for their Heatheni&s;h Idols; and he con&s;trained the Pope, with his Cardinals, Arch-Bi&s;hops, Bi&s;hops, Priors, Monks, Friers &amp; all the Eccle&s;ta&s;tical per&s;ons, for to &s;erve at their Heatheni&s;h Altars; and to &s;acrifice to their Devils, after the cu&s;tome of the Heathens.</P>

<P>KIng <HI>Pepin</HI> being thus come to <HI>Rome,</HI> be&s;ieged it, and after &s;ome few days &s;pent, he called about him his Barons, Knights, and mighty men of War, and began to &s;peak unto them in this manner: My Lords and followers, you well know that this Heatheni&s;h Admiral, Enemy to the Chri&s;tian Faith, and Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> hath put many Chri&s;tians to the Sword, and violently troden under foot all &s;uch as with&s;tood his power; therefore it is our duties to commi&s;erate their e&s;tate that are thus overthrown, and to try the fortune of a battel again&s;t tho&s;e Heatheni&s;h Pagans, and either drive them out of the City, or leave our dead Carka&s;&s;es as a prey, as man<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter"> have done before.

The Admiral hearing this pittiful, yet cunning tale of <HI>Valentine,</HI> &s;aid unto him, Son, I do &s;wear by <HI>Mahomet,</HI> thou &s;halt not be refu&s;ed, but at this in&s;tant I offer thee the Iu&s;ts, and to the end, that tho&s;e French-men that lye in &s;iege before the City may have a &s;ight hereof, and &s;ee thy valour, I will ordain the place of Iu&s;ting to be without the City. <HI>Valentine</HI> humbly thanked him, and in token of his acceptance and feigned love, he fell down and ki&s;&s;ed the feet of the Admiral. <HI>Valent<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ne</HI> grew up in great favor in the Admirals Court, but yet it often troubled his mind, that he never could under&s;tand who were his Parents: but the while he be&s;towed his wandring thoughts hereabout, the Admiral &s;aid thus unto him: Fair Son, methinks you are very penfive and &s;ad. 'Tis true (quoth he) and not without cau&s;e, for I am much afraid that I &s;hall be &s;lain in the&s;e Iu&s;ts, wherefore my reque&s;t is, that I may have a Confe&s;&s;or to give me ab&s;olution for my &s;ins. Then the Admiral commanded that a Prie&s;t &s;hould be brought unto him, The Prie&s;t being come, &s;aid unto <HI>Valentine,</HI> Now confe&s;s you unto me. <HI>Valentine</HI> getting the Prie&s;t a&s;ide, and being together, he &s;aid thus unto him: Sir, you are a Chri&s;tian Prie&s;t, and above
<PB N="49" REF="29"> all other, you ought mo&s;t to defend the Chri&s;tian Faith, wherefore hearken to that I &s;hall tell you, for it is a thing requireth great &s;ecre&s;ie. Thus it is, You know that this day I am to ju&s;t with the heatheni&s;h Admiral, the greate&s;t enemy of Chri&s;tian People: now I am well a&s;&s;ured, that a great number of the <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">arazen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI> will i&s;&s;ue forth of the City, to be eye-witne&s;&s;es of the&s;e Iu&s;ts, to be held without the walls of the City. Therefore you &s;hall give warning to all Chri&s;tians to keep within the walls, arming them&s;elves in a readine&s;s, and clo&s;ely keep it from the ears of the Pagans: &s;o when the Pagans are come forth to behold the&s;e Iu&s;ts the Chri|&s;tians &s;uddenly &s;hall &s;urprize the Guards that k&eacute;ep the Gates and if any mutany ari&s;e, let them keep out tho&s;e that are out. And &s;end a Me&s;&s;enger to King <HI>Pepin</HI> of what is done, that he with his Army may come upon them that are without, while tho&s;e within are &s;et on by the armed Chri&s;tians, &s;o begirting them on every &s;ide, that in the end we may make &s;uch a &s;laughter on them, that the Chri&s;tians may receive both their City in peace, and their former liberty. So having ended his &s;p&eacute;ech, the Prie&s;t departed. Then the Admiral commanded <HI>Valentine</HI> to be led into his Chamber to dine, giving them charge he &s;hould be honourably attended at the board. Being &s;et among many Lords, he behaved him&s;elf gently and mildly towards all. Dinner being done, the Admiral called unto him a Nephew of his, named <HI>Salatas,</HI> commanding him to &s;&eacute;e <HI>Valentine</HI> as well armed at all points as him&s;elf, and moreover charged his Nephew to deliver unto <HI>Valentine</HI> the be&s;t hor&s;e in his &s;table. <HI>Salatas</HI> having received this command from his Vncle the Admiral, took <HI>Valentine</HI> and led him into a fair Hall: being come thither, he cau&s;ed to be laid before him divers Armors, willing him to make choice of the be&s;t: <HI>Valentine</HI> ca&s;t his eyes upon them all, and at la&s;t appointed the Armor wherewith he would be armed, and making him&s;elf ready as fa&s;t as he could, he approached down into the outer Court, whereas he was attended with his hor&s;e, ready to put his foot into the &s;tirrup. Being come down out of the Hall, he pre&s;ently mounted his hor&s;e, the Admiral i&s;&s;ued likewi&s;e ready armed out of his privy Palace. Being thus armed, they took their way towards the chief Gate of the City of <HI>Rome,</HI> for on that &s;ide King <HI>Pepin</HI> had &s;aid his &s;iege.</P>
<PB N="50" REF="30">
<P>When they were both in the field, <HI>Valentine</HI> hung his Shield about his neck, in which he wore a Hart wavy in a field of &s;ilver, and on one &s;ide of the Hart a Tree, all which did &s;ignifie that he was found in a Forre&s;t, and were the &s;ame Arms King <HI>Pepin</HI> be&s;towed on him. The Champions being entred the Li&s;ts, great was the clamour of the <HI>French,</HI> in joy of <HI>Valentine,</HI> the found whereof the Pagans hearing, &s;uddenly i&s;&s;ued forth out of the City, to behold the&s;e Triumphant Iu&s;ts. The Fryer having plaid his part among the Chri&s;tians within the City, pre&s;ently after the Pa|gans were gone out to behold the&s;e Triumphs, addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;on of the gates, which having gotten, there was no entrance again to be expected. King <HI>Pepin</HI> being made acquainted with their purpo&s;e, prepared all his men of War ready to relieve <HI>Valentine,</HI> if nece&s;&s;ity required.

<P>So each of them being prepared for the encounter, they valiant|ly couched their &s;pears, and the fir&s;t cour&s;e proved &s;o valiant, that their Spears &s;hivered all in &s;plinters: each Combatant percei|ving valour to brandi&s;h on the top of his Helm, made out a &s;econd cour&s;e, where <HI>Valentine</HI> got the better, for with his Spear (charg|ed again&s;t the brea&s;t of the Admiral) he gave him &s;uch a &s;trong blow, that he forced his &s;pear quite through his body, in&s;omuch that he fell from his hor&s;e &s;tark dead, making a pitiful noi&s;e at his departure, wherefore the Pagans ran &s;uddenly upon <HI>Valentine,</HI> and would have killed him. <HI>Valentine</HI> perceiving their intent, with a re&s;olute courage put Spurs to his Hor&s;e, and with his Sword drawn, violently ru&s;hed through the thicke&s;t of the Pa|gans, and &s;lew many of them, as he pa&s;&s;ed through them. King <HI>Pepin</HI> al&s;o, with his Ho&s;t came up to the aid of <HI>Valentine,</HI> but he was &s;o hard be&s;et by the Pagans, that he was &s;mitten from off his Hor&s;e, which <HI>Valentine</HI> e&s;pying came up to the re&s;cue of the King, &s;o that he hor&s;ed him again.</P>
<P>The King perceiving him&s;elf delivered out of danger, called unto <HI>Valentine,</HI> and &s;aid: My Child, thou ha&s;t &s;aved my life, which if the Gods grant to &s;pare, I will reward thee liberally. By this time the Battel grew &s;o hot, that the Pagans were forced to re|tire to the City, when they came to the gates, the Chri&s;tians that were in the City i&s;&s;ued on them, and placed the En&s;igns and Standards of King <HI>Pepin</HI> on the Walls. The Pagans &s;eeing King <HI>Pepins</HI> Colours di&s;played upon the walls, betook them&s;elves to &s;light: in cha&s;e of them the Chri&s;tians followed on &s;o fa&s;t, that they &s;hamefully ended their days. In this Battel were &s;lain a 1000 Pagans, only by the means of <HI>Valentine,</HI> who bare him&s;elf &s;o vali|antly that day, that he was the death of four Hor&s;es at the lea&s;t. And thus by his prowe&s;s, the City was again re&s;tored to the Chri|&s;tians, for which deed, there was great triumph in all Chri&s;ten|dom, but e&s;pecially at <HI>Rome,</HI> &s;o that all the Inhabitants round about, gave everla&s;ting prai&s;e to <HI>Pepin</HI> King of <HI>France,</HI> and by the general applau&s;e of the people, he was &s;acred Emperor, and Crowned by the Pope.

Valentine</HI> replyed: Madam, I can hinder no man to &s;peak what plea&s;eth him; but as for my &s;elf, I have done little de&s;erving prai&s;e, but it hath plea&s;ed the King your Father to do me great honour, even &s;o much, as all the days of my life I am not able to make the lea&s;t part of recompence: and as he &s;pake the&s;e words, <HI>Haufray</HI> and <HI>Henry,</HI> (two men compo&s;ed of all envy) entred the Chamber of <HI>Eglantine:</HI> and &s;&eacute;eing him, began thus to &s;peak: <HI>Valentine,</HI> what have you to do here in the Chamber of our Si&s;ter? it is no place for &s;uch Straglers as you are: this your boldne&s;s is not to be born: no man knows of whom you are; therefore we ad|vi&s;e you to be warned, that you attempt not the like again, lea&s;t you dearly buy the&s;e your pre&s;umptions: <HI>Valentine</HI> hearing the&s;e words, an&s;wered: Wrong me not, for I entred not the Chamber of your Si&s;ter, to her di&s;honour. What though I be poor, and not known of whence I am. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">et I am not &s;o ba&s;e as to offer violence vnto one de&s;cended from the blood of Kings? And further, I pro|mi&s;e
<PB N="53" REF="31"> and vow never to come neer her Chamber again: and there|withal departed, leaving the Lady mournful all alone.</P>
<P><HI>Valentine</HI> ha&s;ted to the Palace, to wait upon the King at Din|ner, where was in pre&s;ence <HI>Haufray</HI> and <HI>Henry,</HI> and the Duke <HI>Millain Daugler,</HI> who likewi&s;e waited upon the King during din|ner time. Dinner being fini&s;hed, the King aro&s;e and called to <HI>Valentine,</HI> and in hearing of all his Nobles thus began to &s;ay: My Lords, here is <HI>Valent<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ne,</HI> that hath well-de&s;erved at our hands, and that &s;aved my life when I was in danger; therefore to the end you may take knowledge of his good &s;ervice towards me, I fr&eacute;ely give unto him the Earldom of <HI>Clerimont</HI> of <HI>Avergne,</HI> and when I can be&s;tow more upon him, he &s;hall not be forgotten. <HI>Valentine</HI> gave him many thanks, &s;aying, that he had heaped upon him more honours then he could any way de&s;erve. <HI>Haufray</HI> and <HI>Henry</HI> hearing the&s;e words grew greatly male-content, and at la&s;t <HI>Hen|ry</HI> began to talk with his Brother on this manner: This found fellow, I perceive, grows in great favour with the King, and there mu&s;t be &s;ome cour&s;e taken to cro&s;s his de&s;igns, or el&s;e our over|throw will &s;hortly follow upon it; for (quoth he) you know well that the King hath no Sons but we two, and one little one (named <HI>Charlemain</HI>) which if our Father dye, may by our furtherance quickly be &s;et be&s;ide the Kingdom. Again it is greatly to be feared, that this <HI>Valentine</HI> will &s;upport and uphold him again&s;t us. Therefore brother, I think if good to frame &s;ome plot again&s;t him, to bring him in di&s;plea&s;ure with the King, and &s;o far to pro|&s;ecute our revenge again&s;t him, that if it be po&s;&s;ible, we will not onely work his down-fal, but life and all. This being effected, we may at our plea&s;ure govern the Realm without contradiction. He having ended his &s;peech, <HI>Haufray</HI> replyed; Let it be as thou ha&s;t &s;aid; and that we may entrap his life, this &s;hall be our plot; We will both go to the King, and tell him, that this up-&s;tart hath de|flourd our Si&s;ter, and that we took him in bed with her, which, when the King heareth, will &s;urely put him to death. Being thus re&s;olved, they daily fed their imaginations with the death of <HI>Va|lentine,</HI> while he (nothing mi&s;tru&s;ting) &s;erved the King daily in all duty, in&s;omuch that the Kings love daily encrea&s;ed toward him; and above all other mo&s;t de&s;ired his company.</P>
<PB N="54" REF="32">
<P>Here let us leave off a little, and come to <HI>Or&s;on</HI> his Brother, who all this while lived in the Forre&s;t, &s;o much feared of all men, that none dur&s;t approach nigh the wood. Daily complaints came unto the King from every &s;ide, and among&s;t the re&s;t it chanced on a day, that a poor man came unto the King all wounded, &s;aying thus unto him: Sir, I am come before you to make complaint a|gain&s;t a Wild-man in the woods, for one day, as I and my wife pa&s;&s;ed through the Forre&s;t, carrying bread and other victuals, the wild-man came upon us, took it away, and eat it every bit, and more then that, he violently took my wife from me, and con&s;trained her to yield unto his lawle&s;s lu&s;t. The King hearing out the poor mans tale, was di&s;po&s;ed to make him&s;elf merry with his ill for|tune, and thereupon asked the poor man this que&s;tion: Whether griev'd him mo&s;t, either the taking away of his victuals, or his wife: By my faith, &s;aid the poor man, at the wrong offered to my wife. Thou ha&s;t rightly &s;aid (quoth the King:) therefore I com|mand my Trea&s;urer to &s;ee re&s;titution made unto thee, for the lo&s;s of thy victuals, but as for thy wife, thou mu&s;t bare the burden thereof thy &s;elf.</P>
<P>After this the King called all his Barons to a&s;&s;emble, and take &s;ome order to take this <HI>Or&s;on,</HI> all which they did; and hereupon a Proclamation was &s;ent unto all parts of the Realm, that who&s;o|ever he was, that could take this wild-man alive, or dead, &s;hould have a thou&s;and marks for his reward. Hereupon a&s;&s;embled many worthy Knights to take this task in hand, but the King being one day in his Palace, in the mid&s;t of his Nobles, talking and debating who &s;hould be appointed to this bu&s;ine&s;s, <HI>Haufray</HI> (ene|my unto <HI>Valentine</HI>) being there, &s;aid thus unto the King: Sir, here is <HI>Valentine,</HI> whom you have nouri&s;hed, and advanced to high dignities, and one that hath offered unlawful love to our Si&s;ter <HI>Eglantine:</HI> He were fitte&s;t to &s;et forward to try his valour, and let him be imployed to fetch in this Wild-man, that is &s;uch a terror to the Inhabitants: and if by his valour he can vanqui&s;h him, then let him have <HI>Eglantine</HI> in Marriage, which is his de&s;ired wi&s;h. The King hearing the&s;e words of his Son; &s;aid; Away, for thy &s;peech &s;avoureth of nothing but envy. What though he be poor, of low birth, and found in a Forre&s;t, yet I find him to me true, and
<PB N="55" REF="32"> tru&s;ty, and of Gentile carriage, and to me &s;eemeth to be born of a more noble parentage, than thou art: Leave off the&s;e thy malici|ous and bitter &s;peeches again&s;t him; for the behaviour that dwel|leth in him, &s;hews that he is de&s;cended of a more Nobler linage, then as yet to us appeareth. And I for my part (for the divers vir|tues that daily are &s;een in him) am willing that he go to my daughter when ever he plea&s;e, for I am well a&s;&s;ured, that no di&s;ho|nour can be offered out of a branch of &s;uch a generous &s;pirit.</P>
<P><HI>Haufray</HI> hearing the King make this Apology on the behalf of <HI>Valentine,</HI> was &s;ore di&s;plea&s;ed in heart, but &s;etting a good face up|on the matter, di&s;&s;embled his countenance for that time, but it &s;eemed <HI>Valentine</HI> well ob&s;erved him, and at la&s;t brake forth into the&s;e words: <HI>Haufray,</HI> without any cau&s;e given on my part, ye have &s;poken ill of me, and your will it is, that I &s;hould undertake the fight and conque&s;t of the Wild-man, only to this end, that I might end my days, and &s;o your revenge be accompli&s;hed upon me: Well, be it &s;o, here before the King, I take a &s;olemn Oath, that I will take the enterprize upon me, and find out the Wild-man, and having found him, I will fight with him, and either bring him alive or dead, or el&s;e leave my dead carca&s;s as a witne&s;s in the open field. But if I conquer and live, I will never more be &s;een in this Country, till I have found the Father that begot me, as al&s;o, bring to light whether I was lawfully begotten in Wed|lock, and how I came to be left an infant in the wood.</P>
<P>The King under&s;tanding well what danger <HI>Valentine</HI> had plunged him&s;elf into, grew exc&eacute;eding angry again&s;t his two &s;ons, cur&s;ing them, for that they were the cau&s;e of this dangerous en|terprize: for he loved <HI>Valentine</HI> more then any, and at la&s;t called unto <HI>Valentine,</HI> and &s;aid: My Child, advi&s;e you well what you un|dertake, for with the Wild-man to fight is de&s;peration it &s;elf, you cannot be ignorant how many valiant men, and worthy Champi|ons, have b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter"> him been overcome: and others likewi&s;e of valiant account that have for&s;aken this Combat. Therefore I &s;ay, let not the evil words of a few malicious men, make you de&s;perate in lo|&s;ing your life. For, my Child, it is far better to indure all the bitter words of envy (which is accounted vertue) then to hazard ones life again&s;t &s;uch a mon&s;ter, and no man.</P>

<P><HI>Valentine</HI> replyed, Pardon me (my Leige) for I will never re|boke my intended purpo&s;e: They call me found brat, which grie|veth my very &s;oul, for indeed I know not what I am, nor of what place, but I re&s;t determined, and &s;o take my leave; for to morrow morning will I &s;et forward to my intended enterprize. Having taken his leave, marvel not, though the fair Lady <HI>Eglantine</HI> made great lamentation for what had hapned, but the next morning by break of day, &s;he called one of her Maidens, and &s;aid; Go unto <HI>Valentine,</HI> and bid him come and &s;peak with me before his depar|ture, bid him fear no danger of life, for I would fain take my leave of him.

<P>NOw is <HI>Valentine</HI> upon his journey to the Forre&s;t, accompa|nied only with his Page; whether being come, he put his Helmet on his head, and &s;ent him back again. So he rode forth all that day, &s;eeking the Wild-man, but he could not find him, &s;o the night drawing on, he de&s;cended from his hor&s;e, and tyed him
<PB N="57" REF="33"> up unto a tree: having &s;o done, he refre&s;hed his body with &s;uch victuals as he had brought with him: and when he had eaten, &amp; the day &s;hut in, <HI>Valentine</HI> for fear betook him to a top of a tree, and there abode al that night. In the morning &s;o &s;oon as day appeared he looked round about, &amp; at la&s;t e&s;pyed his Brother <HI>Or&s;on</HI> runing through the Forre&s;t: At length when he came to the place where <HI>Valentine</HI> had tyed his hor&s;e, the Wild man &s;till drawing nearer unto him, wondring at the beauty of the hor&s;e began to claw him with his long nails, thinking to rouze up the courage of the hor&s;e, for he had never &s;een the like. The hor&s;e feeling the Wild mans nails &s;cratching his &s;ide, began to fling and kick exceedingly, <HI>Va|lentine</HI> &s;iting in the top of a tree, noted the terrible &s;hape of the Wild man, and began to be afraid, but calling on the Gods, he re|que&s;ted their aid again&s;t this Mon&s;ter. <HI>Or&s;on</HI> all this while was &s;till bu&s;ied in beholding this hor&s;e, and &s;till offering him &s;uch in|jury with his nails, that the hor&s;e did nothing but kick and bite him. When <HI>Or&s;on</HI> perceived the Hor&s;e to be too hard for him, he caught fa&s;t hold on the hor&s;e, that he thought to ca&s;t him over, and fight with him. <HI>Valentine</HI> perceiving his hor&s;e in danger to be &s;lain, he cryed out aloud, and &s;aid, Wild man, leave my Hor&s;e, and &s;tay but till I come down, and with me thou &s;halt have fight|ing enough. The Wild man hearing a &s;trange voice, looked up into the tree, &amp; e&s;pying there a man, made unto him divers &s;igns with his hands and head to come down and he would pull him in peices. <HI>Valentine</HI> making all the ha&s;t he could, drew his &s;word, &amp; leapt upon the Ground clo&s;e by the Wild man; when <HI>O &s;on</HI> &s;aw the Sword, and that he offered to &s;mite him therewith, he leaped and kept him from the &s;troak, but &s;uddenly returned back again upon <HI>Valentine,</HI> and threw him unto the ground.

The King hearing this &s;udden news, was much troubled, in mind: and pre&s;ently called before him the Arch-Bi&s;hop of <HI>Rhemes,</HI> the Duke <HI>Myllon Daugler, Gar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">s</HI> and <HI>Samp&s;on,</HI> the&s;e with others of his Nobles being a&s;&s;embled, he declared what the Me&s;&s;enger had &s;aid, and withal craved their Coun&s;el what was be&s;t to be done, whether to go to <HI>Aquitain</HI> to &s;uccor Duke <HI>Sava|ry,</HI> or to <HI>Lyons,</HI> to re&s;i&s;t the <HI>Almains,</HI> whereunto <HI>Millon Daugler</HI> made this an&s;wer: The Duke I confe&s;s de&s;erveth to be &s;uccour|ed but yet in two extreams, let us chu&s;e the le&s;s: Therefore I judge it mo&s;t meet, fir&s;t to defend our own Land, that is now in pre&s;ent danger: and for the Duke, he mu&s;t be content to take our pre&s;ent affairs for an&s;wer: &s;o Generally it was concluded to go for <HI>Lyons.</HI></P>
<P>With the&s;e words the Me&s;&s;enger that came from the Duke of <HI>Savary</HI> departed, and carried the&s;e tydings with him to <HI>Aquitain,</HI> which made him very &s;orrowful to hear it, becau&s;e the Green Knight had very &s;trongly a&s;&s;ailed him. Now here gentle Reader I let you under&s;tand, for the better ordering our proceeding, that this Green Knight here &s;poken of, was brother to <HI>Ferragus,</HI> the Gyant that kept the Lady <HI>Bellyfant</HI> in his Ca&s;tle, who was the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed mother of the&s;e two Infants, born in the Wood, called <HI>Valentine</HI> and <HI>Or&s;on,</HI> as is before declared. Duke <HI>Savary</HI> percei|ving no hope of aid from King <HI>Pepin,</HI> made open Proclimation throughout all his Dominions, that all, of what condition &s;oever, &s;hould be ready armed again&s;t the morow after, for he would then go out upon the Green Knight, and Fight with him in the Field, all which was accordingly performed. The day appointed being come, both armies met, as well Hor&s;e as Foot, the Pagan<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter"> pre|&s;ented them&s;elves in multitudes &amp; the Green Kt. behave him|&s;elf &s;o valiantly, that the fir&s;t encounter, with his Battel-Ax at two blows he &s;lew two valiant Knights. Duke <HI>Savary</HI> perceiv|ing him to be &s;o warlike a General, came up to encounter him, and meeting, they a&s;&s;ailed each other, but the Duke was ill-advi|&s;ed to adventure his body again&s;t the Green Knight, becau&s;e it was ever peremptorily reported of him, that he &s;hould never be
<PB N="68" REF="39"> overcome of any, except he were a Kings Son, and &s;uch a one as had never &s;ucked the brea&s;ts of any woman. But the Green Kt. was herein deceived, for he thought it impo&s;&s;ible any &s;uch man &s;hould be upon the face of the earth: but it fell out contrary to his expectation, as you &s;hall under&s;tand. Let us now return to the two valiant leaders, who fought long and fiercely, but the Duke ven|tured &s;o far into the enemies hands, that when he had thought to have retired; he could not, for he was round begirt with &s;uch mul|titudes of Pagans, that he was taken pri&s;oner, and brought back unto the Green Knight, who&s;e Ran&s;om could not be Granted for any Gold or Trea&s;ure. His men at Arms perceiving the Duke &s;urprized, returned to <HI>Acquitain,</HI> &s;ore lamenting the lo&s;s of their good Duke. And his three Sons, <HI>Garin</HI> the elder, <HI>An&s;elmne</HI> and <HI>Garin</HI> the younger, made great moan to &s;ee the hard hap of their Father, led captive among the Pagans.</P>
<P>The Sons having &s;hewed their &s;orrows, in comes <HI>Fezon</HI> his Daughter with this lamenting out-cry, Alas: in an ill hour was I born, &s;eeing that &s;o many valiant Knights and Gentlemen have &s;uffered death in my quarrel, and yet there is one thing more troubleth my di&s;tempered &s;oul than all the re&s;t, which is this, that my Father &s;hould be held captive in the hands of his Enemies, the onely way to bring his aged years with &s;orrow to the Grave. Alas (dear Father) your love to me is the onely cau&s;e of all the&s;e di&s;a&s;terous chances. Thus fell <HI>Fezon</HI> into a dangerous fit of di&s;|content, in&s;omuch, as with this extremity of &s;orrow, &s;he had well|nigh fini&s;hed her days, had not the re&s;t of the Ladies attendant, laboured to comfort her in this great &s;orrow, wherewith &s;he was almo&s;t overcome.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t the Lady was thus oppre&s;&s;ed with &s;orrow, the Green Kt. triumphed over the worthy Duke, cau&s;ing him to be brought before him into his Pavilion, and having him there, began to re|vile him in this di&s;dainful manner: Duke, now thou perceive&s;t that thou art my Va&s;&s;al and that I have power over thy life: this that I &s;peak thou can&s;t not deny: therefore let me tell thee what thou &s;halt expect from my &s;acred lips: either give me thy Daugh|ter <HI>Fezon</HI> to Wife, and &s;o redeem thy life, or el&s;e I will have her again&s;t thy will, leading her among&s;t rough Mountains, and
<PB N="69" REF="39"> there royally Crown her Queen of tho&s;e craggy Man&s;ions.</P>
<P>The Duke hearing the&s;e proud menaces, began thus to reply: Proud and in&s;olent Sarazen, know this, that I will never give con&s;ent that thou have my Daughter except thou al&s;o &s;ub&s;cribe to be baptized. The Green Knight hearing him &s;ay &s;o, replyed: Vrge me no further, for I am wholly bound to <HI>Mahomet:</HI> Wherefore once again I tell thee, except thou yeild to my demand I wil fir&s;t make thee fini&s;h thy days mi&s;erably, and afterward con&s;ume all <HI>Acquitain</HI> to a&s;hes, and after that put to the Sword all that come in my way, men, women, and Ch<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ldren. The Duke hearing this Pagan thus re&s;olute, began again on this manner: Pagan, the Gods protect me from thy cruelty, for I had rather rely on their power then thine. The Green Knight hearing him &s;ay &s;o, began wi&s;tly to &s;et his eye upon him, &amp; marking his unwonted lamenta|tions, began a fre&s;h with him on this manner: grave Duke, leave off the&s;e thy &s;ad laments, and hearken unto my relation and re&s;o|lution al&s;o, and this it &s;o: I am not a&s;hamed to let thee under|&s;tand, that thy Daughters beauty hath enthralled me, and there|fore I will recal my threatned Sentence of death again&s;t thee: Out of which Captivate affections towards thy Daughter, I am forced to yeild to this condition, that thou &s;halt find out a Knight within the &s;pace of &s;ix months, to encounter me, and if &s;o it hap|pen that by &s;trength of Arms he conquer me, I vow by all the Heavens, to &s;end thee back again into thy own country, without wa&s;ting any of the &s;ame: but if it happen, that I p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ove conque|ror over that Knight, then &s;halt thou willingly re&s;ign thy fair Daughter into my hands, to be my lawful wife. The&s;e Articles being produced, the Duke willingly agr&eacute;ed thereunto, &s;o the Truce was accordingly proclaimed.</P>
<P>The&s;e Agreements thus concluded, the Green Knight gave leave that Duke <HI>Savary</HI> &s;hould depart, upon Conditions, that he &s;hould &s;wear to keep covenants, not only for the pre&s;ent, but du|ring his life. The Duke being thus delivered, made his repair to <HI>Aq<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">itain,</HI> whither being come, he cau&s;ed open proclimation to be made of tho&s;e conditions, whereunto he had before &s;ub&s;cribed con|cerning his &s;aid Daughter: and withal, the Truce taken for the &s;pace of &s;ix months. His Councellors hearing what was pa&s;t, ad|vi&s;ed

<P><HI>Or&s;on</HI> perceiving his Brother thus to lay about him, began to rouze him&s;elf, and with his rough hands and piercing tallons, he rent and tore all that came in his way, and &s;o bit them with his t&eacute;eth, that they fell groveling unto the ground one upon another, where he trampled over them like dirt, pinching them with his feet. <HI>Valentine</HI> &s;eeing his brother <HI>Or&s;on</HI> thus be&s;tir him&s;elf, held up his bloody &s;word, defending him&s;elf, and offending his enemies &s;o valiantly, that they all for&s;ook them, and dur&s;t not &s;tay within their &s;ight: <HI>Grygar</HI> their Captain, perceiving all his men thus pittifully killed and overcome, cryed out with a loud voice on this manner. <HI>Valentine,</HI> yet I wi&s;h thee yeild, or el&s;e look for nothing but death. <HI>Valentine</HI> hearing the&s;e in&s;ulting words, made toward <HI>Grygar,</HI> and in a fierce and furious manner a&s;&s;ailed him; but being too forward, he plunged him&s;elf into the throng, that he was en|clo&s;ed round about, k&eacute;eping off <HI>Or&s;on</HI> with their long &s;pears.

Thus <HI>Valentine</HI> lamented in the dark pit, whil&s;t his enemies determine what &s;hall be done to him: &s;ome were of opinion to put him to death, others, that he &s;hould be committed to a perpetual impri&s;onment.

Among&s;t the re&s;t, at the la&s;t he lighted upon the Traitor <HI>Grygar,</HI> who e&s;pying <HI>Or&s;on</HI> hung his head in his bo&s;ome. <HI>Or&s;on</HI> having once got the &s;ight of him, ran furiou&s;ly upon him, and gave him &s;uch a &s;turdy &s;troak, that he &s;mote off one of his ears: After he began to lay upon his face, in|&s;omuch that he put out one of his eyes, and broke one of his t&eacute;eth. <HI>Grygar</HI> being thus wounded, began to cry out for help, but <HI>Or&s;on</HI> hearing him make &s;uch an uproar, ran again upon him, and gave him &s;uch another &s;troak, that he felled him unto the earth, over|throwing tables, meat, and all that &s;tood before him; which drave all the beholders into admiration; and had he not been re&s;cued by a valiant Prince that then &s;at at Board, he had never gone from that place alive: which Prince having re&s;cued him, began to &s;ay unto the King on this manner: Mighty King, con&s;ider into what danger this man is fallen by the fury of this wild-man; and either let him dye for this pre&s;umptious fact, or no man will be able to come into your Court. The King hearing him &s;ay &s;o: replyed, we will con&s;ider the cau&s;e, and as we find it, &s;o will we proceed a|gain&s;t him. Bring him hither before us, that we may que&s;tion the cau&s;e of this his fact. <HI>Or&s;on</HI> was brought before the King, and he
<PB N="77" REF="43"> demanded how he dur&s;t pre&s;ume &s;o far into the pre&s;ence of his Maje&s;ty? <HI>Or&s;on</HI> pre&s;enly an&s;wered by &s;igns, how that they had &s;lain <HI>Valen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ine</HI> in the Forre&s;t, and that he would be revenged for his death, on that inhumane Traitor <HI>Grygar,</HI> and withal clo&s;ed his fi&s;t, and put it to his mouth in great rage, in token of de&s;tance. K. <HI>Pepin</HI> perceiving by his action, the cour&s;e of the matter, called forth unto all the Lords and Barons on this manner: My Lords, you &s;&eacute;e as well as I, that this wild-man hath challenged <HI>Grygar,</HI> to fight with him, therefore tell me your opinions what is be&s;t to be done in this ca&s;e, for I cannot chu&s;e but marvel why this Wild-man &s;hould find out <HI>Grygar</HI> above all the re&s;t of the Knights here a&s;|&s;embled: therefore let every man freely &s;peak, for I much doubt &s;ome hidden &s;ecret to lye herein, and for my part I could willingly give con&s;ent that it &s;hould be tryed forth by combat betw&eacute;en them. When the King had thus uttered what he thought, the Barons agreed to the verdict that the King had pa&s;&s;ed. So the Battel was determined, and <HI>Grygar</HI> was brought before the King, to the in|tent he &s;hould undergo the Challenge again&s;t the Wild-man: <HI>Grygar</HI> hearing what the King had determined, was very fearful and &s;ad, and not without cau&s;e: for he fore-&s;aw hereby, that his trea&s;on would come to light, and therewithal ca&s;t an ill-favoured eye on <HI>Haufray. Henr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI> perceiving <HI>Grygar</HI> &s;tand &s;o amazed, &s;aid, <HI>Grygar,</HI> fear not, for I promi&s;e thee, however it fall out, that no danger &s;hall come unto thee from our father the King, for we will work your peace a&s;&s;uredly, &s;o that thou wilt &s;wear never to reveal the fact; yea, (quoth <HI>Grygar</HI>) I well perceive how the ca&s;e will go with me, I mu&s;t &s;uffer a reproachful death for your &s;ake. Having thus &s;aid, he left <HI>Henry,</HI> and returned unto the King: &s;aying: Mighty King, let me make one reque&s;t unto your Maje&s;ty, that you would di&s;mi&s;s me from this dangerous task, the rea&s;on chiefly mo|ving me, is, that in&s;omuch that it is not man again&s;t man, whereby a Knight may win honour, but a wild &s;avage to encounter with man, and that man no Knight. I think I may &s;afely (&s;o your Grace be plea&s;ed) refu&s;e the Combat. Nay (quoth the King) no excu&s;e in this ca&s;e can be admitted, for the Combat is granted, not only by my advi&s;e, but al&s;o by the coun&s;el of all my Barons, and the rea&s;on moving us &s;o grant it, was, that trea&s;on long lying hid, might

<P>When <HI>Or&s;on</HI> gathered by his wonted &s;igns, that he &s;hould fight with this Traitor, he was right glad, and withal made &s;hews unto the King, <HI>Valentine</HI> was dead, whereat the King grew wondrous &s;ad, and fain would <HI>Or&s;on</HI> have been upon the back of <HI>Grygar,</HI> but that the King commanded him to be taken away, making &s;igns unto him, that he &s;hould &s;trike no more, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ill the time they &s;hould meet for the tryal of the truth. Again, the King called unto <HI>Grygar,</HI> to make ha&s;t to arm him&s;elf: <HI>Grygar</HI> loath to ven|ture his life upon &s;o uncertain ground, began once again to &s;peak unto the King, &s;aying: Mo&s;t dread Soveraign, I have been a long &s;ervitor about your per&s;on both in war and peace, but you reward me not accordingly, in&s;omuch as you compel me to fight again&s;t a man, that hath neither &s;ence, rea&s;on, nor, in truth; humane &s;hape: <HI>Grygar</HI> (&s;aid the King) if the truth be on your &s;ide, you need not fear, for you &s;hall enter into the field well armed, and as for <HI>O<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;on,</HI> he &s;hall adventure upon thee altogether unarmed. Again, you &s;hall be well mounted on Hor&s;e-back, he on foot, nor &s;hall he bear any weapon.

<P><HI>Grygar</HI> being thus armed, and well mounted on his Hor&s;e, went towards the Palace Gate, where this Combat was to be effected: the hour being come, the King repaired to the window to behold the Combat: All the Nobles in the Court being a&s;&s;em|bled, the Iudges were appointed, that no wrong &s;hould be offered on either part. So <HI>Grygar</HI> being entred the Li&s;ts, he e&s;pyed <HI>Or&s;on,</HI> and began to draw near unto him, &s;aying:</P>
<P>Villain, thou ha&s;t offered me great wrong, in putting out one of my eyes, but e're I part, I will make th&eacute;e acknowledge that wrong: and that thou ha&s;t fal&s;ely accu&s;ed me to the King. <HI>Or&s;on</HI> perceiv|ing whereunto his proud &s;peeches tended, &s;hewed him his nails, gna&s;hing his teeth together at him: whereat <HI>Grygar</HI> &s;uddenly cou|ched his Spear within his re&s;t, and ran upon him. <HI>Or&s;on</HI> e&s;pying the Spear bent again&s;t him, gave back, whereby <HI>Grygar</HI> was di&s;|appointed of his mark, and ran his Spear fa&s;t into the ground; <HI>Or&s;on</HI> taking this advantage, &s;uddenly returned back again, &s;eized the Spear into his own hands, and having hold thereof, gave his enemy &s;uch a &s;troak therewith, that he a&s;tonied him. <HI>Grygar</HI> f&eacute;el|in the fury of his &s;troak, &s;et &s;purs to his hor&s;e, and rid like a mad man about the field: <HI>Or&s;on</HI> ran after him with a grinning coun|tenance, making &s;igns to the King, that he would e're long force him to yeild unto him. <HI>Grygar</HI> fearing the danger wherein he was like to fall, &s;ecretly to him&s;elf murmured out the&s;e words: Ah <HI>Haufray,</HI> for thy cau&s;e and &s;ake I am thus delivered over to death. Long and tedious was the fight, but <HI>Grygar</HI> could never &s;o much as wound the Wild-man.</P>
<P>At la&s;t <HI>Or&s;on</HI> ca&s;t away his Spear, and came clo&s;e to <HI>Grygar,</HI> in &s;uch manner, that he caught his hor&s;e fa&s;t by the neck, making him &s;o mad and furious, that he overthrew his rider to the earth, and with the fall thereof he lo&s;t his Shield. <HI>Or&s;on</HI> e&s;pying the Shield, took it up, and put it upon his own back; after he came unto <HI>Grygars</HI> Hor&s;e, and gat upon him, riding round about the Field, and making ill-favoured &s;igns and tokens, in&s;much, as all the beholders there pre&s;ent, &s;tood as men di&s;mayed.

<P>AT la&s;t <HI>Grygar</HI> was brought before the King, who asked pardon for his high offence, and in the pre&s;ence of all the be|holders, told him, that the onely actors in this Traiterous plot, were <HI>Haufray</HI> and <HI>Henry</HI> his Sons, and by their means he had taken <HI>Valentine</HI> and put him in pri&s;on, and there meaned (in &s;ecret manner) to have put him to death.

At la&s;t when he had ruminated all his imaginations, he began to re&s;olve upon this conclu&s;ion. I am not, neither can be that Kings Son that &s;hould overcome the Green Knight, for I can neither remove the Shield he &s;ent me for, neither was I nouri&s;hed with|out the brea&s;t of Woman.

The Wild-man under&s;tanding the &s;ubtilty intended, agr&eacute;ed unto all that <HI>Valent<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ne</HI> commanded him.

<HEAD>CHAP. XXV. How King Pepin came to the knowledge that Valentine and Or|&s;on were his Nephews, by the report of Blandiman: and how the Green Knight &s;ubmitted him&s;elf, according to his promi&s;e made unto Valentine.</HEAD>
<P><HI>BLandiman</HI> having delivered his Me&s;&s;age, the King began to demand of him where his Si&s;ter was: <HI>Blandiman</HI> re|plied, I know right well where &s;he is, but I have given her my word never to di&s;cover to any: But worth King, if you make doubt of her loyalty, I &s;hall bring you a man that will fight in her quarrel, to prove her hone&s;t. Nay (quoth the King) I have &s;&eacute;en try|al enough thereof already, by the downfal of the Arch-Prie&s;t. Al&s;o I have made much means to hear of her, but cannot hear any

My Lord (quoth <HI>Blandiman</HI>) know this for a truth, that my Lady laid her great be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ly in the Forre&s;t of <HI>O<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">leance,</HI> and whil&s;t &s;he di&s;patched me to get her the help of a woman, or ever I could return, &s;he was delivered of two fair Sons, the one of which was carried violently from her by a Bare into the Wood, &s;he never wi&s;t whither, but &s;he followed the Bare &s;o long, till at la&s;t I found her in a dangerous &s;ound upon the ground. I coming to her, took her up in my arms, and comforted her &s;o well as I could, till being &s;omewhat recovered, in woful &s;ighs &s;he unfolded unto me the whole manner of the lo&s;s of her child by the Bare: and for the o|ther, &s;he had left it under the Tree: I hearing her &s;ay &s;o, ha&s;ted towards that tr&eacute;e whereas I left her, but being come thither, I could not find the other ch<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ld neither. And thus (worthy King) have I related unto you the whole &s;tory of your Si&s;ter, and her two Infants in the Forre&s;t, and other tydings have I none, but this, that I am that <HI>Blandiman</HI> that you gave unto your Si&s;ter to attend her, when &s;he married the Emperor <HI>Alexander.</HI> The King giving ear unto this tale, at la&s;t &s;aid: Alas <HI>Blandiman,</HI> thy words &s;trikes me into a thou&s;and fears, what &s;hould become of my S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;ter, but &s;eeing thou can&s;t tell no more, tell me yet how long ago this is, that thou ha&s;t told me. My Lord (quoth he) it was even that day you met me in the Forre&s;t of <HI>O<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">leance,</HI> and I related unto you the pitious tydings of your Si&s;ters bani&s;hment. This &s;truck the King into &s;uch an admiration, that he began to recollect his wits, &amp; then pre&s;ently came into his mind the finding of <HI>Valentine</HI> in y^e forre&s;t, &amp; how by the &s;ame <HI>Valentine, Or&s;on</HI> was conquered in the &s;ame wood. Then he began to think on the &s;tory that <HI>B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">andiman</HI> had told him &amp; thereby knew that the&s;e were y^e two babes brought forth by his &s;i&s;ter: wherefore he &s;ent for his Queen &amp; other Ladies, to let them under&s;tand what <HI>Blandiman</HI> had declared, &s;aying: My Lords, I have long time nouri&s;hed &amp; brought up in my Court two poor Children; and now it doth plainly appear they are Sons to an Emperor, &amp; my near kin&s;men; <HI>Valentine</HI> the one, whom I found in the Forre&s;t of <HI>Orleance,</HI> brought forth there by my &s;i&s;ter <HI>Belly&s;ant,</HI>
<PB N="106" REF="58"> in the time of her exile; and <HI>Or&s;on</HI> who was likewi&s;e vanqui&s;hed by <HI>Valentine,</HI> to be his natural brother, and both Sons to the Em|peror of <HI>Greece.</HI> At the&s;e tydings all the Court was wondrous to f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">l, &s;ave onl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter"> <HI>Haufray</HI> and <HI>Henry,</HI> who in outward &s;hew &s;&eacute;emed glad, but were in their hearts very &s;orrowful, for above all other they de&s;ired the death of <HI>Valent ne,</HI> that next him they might work their wills of their younger brother <HI>Charlemain,</HI> again&s;t whom they chiefly oppo&s;ed them&s;elves, as hereafter will more plainly appear.</P>
<P>But to return back again to <HI>Blandiman,</HI> who hearing the King &s;peak &s;o much of the two children, demanded of the King if he k<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ew in what Country they were: Why (&s;aid the King) one of the&s;e I have brought up in my Court a long time, in &s;uch fa&s;hion, that he is become a right valiant Knight, and by his valour hath conquered his Brother, being a Wild-man, living in the Wood a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter"> <HI>Orle<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">nce</HI> like a Bea&s;t, and one that did much damage to all the Country thereabout. Having conquered him, he brought him to my Court, where having lived &s;ome &s;mall time, they both depart|ed, and took their way towards <HI>Aquitain,</HI> to fight with a right worthy Champion, called the Green Knight, and &s;ince their de|parture I never heard what became of them. Sir (&s;aid <HI>Blandiman</HI>) according to the tale you have told, I remember well, that near <HI>Aquitain</HI> I met two &s;uch, but I am troubled that I knew them not. So the King mu&s;ing at the&s;e accidents, cau&s;ed <HI>Blandiman</HI> to be highly fea&s;ted, and held as a companion among&s;t his other Lords.</P>
<P>Now it hapned, that on the &s;ame day the Green Knight (of whom we have before made mention) arrived at <HI>Paris</HI> at the Kings Court: a&s;&s;oon as he came into the pre&s;ence of King, he &s;aluted him with great reverence. The King &s;eeing him all in Armour, marvelled much thereat, and at la&s;t demanded the cau&s;e of his &s;o appearing, whom he was, and wherefore he came: The Gr&eacute;en Knight replyed again on this manner. Honourable King, know that I am de&s;cended from the <HI>Sarazens,</HI> both by Father and Mo|ther; and true it is, that I am that Knight that for the love of the Lady <HI>Fezon,</HI> daughter to the Duke of <HI>Aquitain,</HI> have for one whole year holden the Duke as my Va&s;&s;al, and in my &s;ubjection, and ha|ving him thus under me, I took a Truce with him for &s;ix months,
<PB N="107" REF="58"> upon the&s;e conditions, that if within that time he found not forth a Knight, that by force of A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ms &s;hould conquer me, I was to have his Daughter <HI>Fezon</HI> to Wife: On the other &s;ide; if I were con|quered, I &s;hould remove away my &s;iege, and depart out of his Territories, without doing any further damage. So it is, that a long time I was fought withal, by divers valiant Knights of all Countries, yet there was not any that could overcome me, but endured death, and were &s;till hanged upon a Tree; at la&s;t it &s;o tell out, that there a&s;&s;ailed me two worthy Knights, the one named <HI>Valentine,</HI> and the other <HI>Or&s;on. Valentine</HI> fought with me one whole day, wherein he bore him&s;elf &s;o bravely, that night coming on, we were forced to give over, all wounded, tired, and wear. The next morning when the battel &s;hould be again renewed, his fellow <HI>Or&s;on</HI> armed him&s;elf in <HI>Valentines</HI> Armour, entred the field in mo&s;t fierce and di&s;dainful manner, offering me defiance: I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">corning any competitor, addre&s;&s;ed out my &s;elf again&s;t him, but little avail|ed my &s;trength, for in the end he overcame me, and would have ta|ken away my life, had not <HI>Valentine</HI> come in upon us, &amp; re&s;cued me, upon condition, fir&s;t, that I would for&s;ake <HI>Mahomet:</HI> &s;econdly, that I &s;hould come unto you, and yield my &s;elf at your command, and to &s;tand to your cen&s;ure either in life or death. Again, when I recei|ved Bapti&s;m, he cau&s;ed me to be called <HI>Pepin,</HI> and &s;o is my name.</P>
<P>The King having heard all this long &s;tory from the G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">&eacute;en Kt. made this an&s;wer in the pre&s;ence of all his Barons: Welcome to us, and of your company we are right glad, live with us in our Court and be jocond, for I freely grant you your life, and promi&s;e you further, that if you will tarry with us in our Country, I will endow you with many fair lands and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions. The King &s;hew|ing him&s;elf thus gracious, demanded of him where the&s;e Knights were, that had conquered him: Marry (qd. the Green Kt.) I left them both at <HI>Aquitain</HI> with the valiant Duke <HI>Savary,</HI> who holdeth them in as great re&s;pect as any that are remaining in his Court.</P>
<P>Thus you may now perceive, that by the words of <HI>Blan|diman,</HI> and the Green Knight, King <HI>Pepin</HI> had perfect intelli|gence of his beautious Si&s;ter, and his two valiant Nephews. Af|ter all the&s;e tydings happened, King <HI>Pepin</HI> made a &s;oleman vow, that he would go him&s;elf in per&s;on into <HI>Greece,</HI> to tell the Empe|ror
<PB N="108" REF="59"> of the&s;e glad&s;om tydings, and to take order to &s;end abroad in|to all Lands to find her out.</P>

Vpon a day, as he &s;at at dinner with the Pope in his Palace pontifical, there came tydings unto him; that the great Souldan of <HI>Aegypt</HI> had be&s;ieged <HI>Con&s;tan|tinople.</HI> The Knight that brought this me&s;&s;age, after his &s;alutati|ons ended, began thus to proceed: Holy Father, the <HI>Sa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">azens</HI> with much power hath be&s;ieged, and wronfully over-run <HI>Con|&s;tantinople,</HI> and he gave me charge to crave your aid again&s;t the&s;e enemies of Chri&s;tendom. When the Pope under&s;tood the&s;e ill-welcome tydings, he was driven into a wondrous dump, not knowing any pre&s;ent way to &s;end them relief: but King <HI>Pepin</HI> being in pre&s;ence, comforted him greatly, and &s;aid: Holy Father, take no care for this bu&s;ine&s;s, for I reque&s;t but a competent &s;um of money and men, and I &s;hall lead them to <HI>Con&s;tantinople</HI> with &s;uch a couragious heart, that I &s;hall put the Soldan and his forces to the wor&s;e, &s;uch an inveterate hatred beat I again&s;t the&s;e Pa|gan Devils.

<P>The Emperor him&s;elf was forced to retire into the City, and being cooped up in &s;o &s;mall a room, his troubled thoughts ever|more ran upon the Lady <HI>Belly&s;ant,</HI> whom he had cruelly bani&s;hed, always fearful that &s;he was dead, for it was now full twenty W<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">nters pa&s;t, &s;ince the time of her exile.

The Soldan having knowledge of his arrival, and al&s;o of his provi&s;ion, was much aba&s;hed thereat, and wjth all diligence returned to his &s;trong Pavilion; and being &s;et down in his magnificence, there came unto him certain of his camp fearfully and doubtfully &s;aying thus unto him: Great and mighty Soldan, we come to give you true intelligence, that there is lately, arrived to the number of two hundred thou&s;and <HI>Romans,</HI> to bid us pre&s;ent battel, under the conduct of <HI>Pepin</HI> King of <HI>France.</HI> Where|fore it only re&s;teth now, that you take &s;udden advi&s;e how to pre|vent and re&s;i&s;t the&s;e forces.

<P>Now began the Sarazens to doubt whether they &s;hould ever e&s;cape away alive, and therefore fearing the wor&s;t, betook them|&s;elves to flight: But their flight being e&s;pyed by the King of <HI>Scla|vonia,</HI> who led the rear-ward for the Souldan, pre&s;ently ru&s;hed in with his troops, con&s;i&s;ting of fifty thou&s;and fighting men, make|ing withal &s;o great a &s;hout, that it &s;eemed by the &s;ound thereof, their part got the better. The Emperor and the King perceiving their coming, wi&s;ely con&s;idered that their men were tyred and out-worn, and the enemy fre&s;h and lu&s;ty, &s;ounded a retreat, and retired them&s;elves and all their Souldiers into the City. The Souldan &s;eeing this, followed upon them, and &s;trongly be&s;ieged the City round about, &s;o that neither the Emperor nor the King could i&s;&s;ue out thereof. Thus they abode till they were well nigh fami&s;hed thinking thereby utterly to overthrough the Chri&s;tians.

<P><HI>FErragus</HI> having thus gotten their good wills to depart for <HI>Portugal,</HI> put all his &s;hips in a readine&s;s, and packing up all their provi&s;ion, they put forth to Sea. Being now at Sea, <HI>Fer|ragus</HI> fell from all his former words of comfort, and began to plot the death of <HI>Valentine</HI> and <HI>Or&s;on.</HI> In the dead time of the night, when the two Brethren were at re&s;t in their Cabins, he cau&s;ed them &s;ecretly to be taken forth of their beds, and committed them to bands, muzling their eyes al&s;o, that they could not &s;ee: Now, when <HI>Clerimond</HI> &s;aw what was done to her love, &s;he fell into an extream agony, and with watry eyes began thus to vent her la|mentations: Alas dear <HI>Valentine</HI> our joys are &s;uddenly turned unto &s;orrow; thou ha&s;t bought my love at too dear a rate, when thou art not only thus mi&s;u&s;ed, but even in danger of thy life: Cur&s;ed be the day of my birth, for with much danger ha&s;t thou purcha&s;ed my love.

Thou ha&s;t deceived the tru&s;t I put in thee, by working &s;o foul an act again&s;t my love: Thou ha&s;t robbed me of all joy and brought upon me an untimely death. Further, know this, that if you put to death the&s;e two Knights, you carry to your grave the name of a villain. Let them alone, their death will work you &s;mall content: or if there be no remedy, &s;pare them and &s;eize fir&s;t upon me, and ca&s;t me into the Sea, for I would not live to &s;ee &s;uch two innocents fal&s;ly put to death without de&s;ert.

<P>The&s;e two Knights having thus done &s;peaking, the people began afre&s;h to gather up their &s;cattered forces, &amp; turned their forces once more upon the Sarazens, with a double courage.

Sir (qd. <HI>Adrimain</HI>) put your tru&s;t in me, and &s;o I take my leave, and &s;o betook him to his magick Art. Being provided of all things, among&s;t y^e re&s;t, he laded him&s;elf with victu|als, and took his way towards <HI>Aquitain;</HI> coming thither, he craved entrance of the gates to &s;ell his victuals, which was ea&s;ily granted. After he had &s;old all, he went into the Palace where he chanced on <HI>P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">colet,</HI> whom <HI>Pacolet</HI> knew well. <HI>Adrimain</HI> (qd. <HI>Pacolet</HI>) you are welcome, from whence come you, and what is your errand? Then (&s;aid <HI>Adrimain</HI>) you know that long I &s;erved K. <HI>Trompart,</HI> put by fate I am fallen into a great mi&s;chance, for one in his Court hav|ing &s;mitten me, becau&s;e I would not teach him the principles of my Art, I drew forth my knife and killed him: Now fearing death, I am expelled the Court and for this cau&s;e I fled towards you for &s;uccour, &amp; will prove unto you a faithful &s;ervant, &s;o you be plea&s;ed to accept of me. <HI>Adrimain,</HI> &s;aid <HI>Pacolet,</HI> I am content let it be &s;o, make thee good chear, and be merry. As they were thus in their Cups, <HI>Adrimain</HI> &s;aw the fair <HI>Clerimond</HI> pa&s;s through the Hall, who pre&s;ently demanded what Lady it was: Then (&s;aid <HI>P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">colet</HI>) it is the S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;ter of <HI>Ferragus</HI> who mu&s;t be married to a right valiant Knight.

<P>At who&s;e words, <HI>Adrimain</HI> drew up a Cup above a Pillar, in &s;uch wi&s;e, that through the Palace (&s;&eacute;emingly to all the company) ran a River, furni&s;hed with all &s;orts of fi&s;h, little and great.

<PB N="151" REF="80"> after, thinking to have taken the Hart: but <HI>Pacolet</HI> by his Art made the Hart &s;uddenly to vani&s;h. This &s;port (qd. <HI>Or&s;on</HI>) was very well performed: and &s;o the company breaking up, <HI>Pacolet</HI> led <HI>A|drima<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">n</HI> to his Chamber, to be with him, but proved fatal, for to|ward midnight, <HI>Adrimain</HI> &s;o enchanted all within the Court, and with them <HI>Pacolet,</HI> that he had time to work all that he de&s;ired. Afterward he went towards the hor&s;e of <HI>P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">colet,</HI> &amp; getting him, came into the Chamber of <HI>Clerimond,</HI> and by Art cau&s;ed her to ri&s;e, and make her ready, and &s;etting her on the Hor&s;e behind him, came unto a window, turned a pin, and &s;uddenly he arrived in the Tent of King <HI>Trompart.</HI> Being come thither, he cryed out aloud, &s;aying: Great King, &s;leep not, but ha&s;ten you hither, and you &s;hall &s;ee the plea&s;ant Lady <HI>Clerimond,</HI> whom I have &s;tollen from <HI>A|quitain,</HI> and with her <HI>Pacolets</HI> hor&s;e. Now, &s;aid the King, I well perceive thy love: is this the Si&s;ter of <HI>Ferragus?</HI> Yea, &s;aid <HI>Adri|main,</HI> and I have &s;tolen her away, and al&s;o betrayed <HI>Pacolet</HI> my fellow Magician, for he &s;hall never be ma&s;ter of his hor&s;e again. I, but (&s;aid the King) art thou acquainted with the manner of his hor&s;e? O, long &s;ince, worthy King, and by vertue of the Pin, how to govern him. Having thus made this known unto K. <HI>Trompart,</HI> he thought to make experience of the hor&s;e him&s;elf, and taking the Lady <HI>Clerimond</HI> behind him, would tran&s;port her into his own Country, and there marry her.</P>
<P>He being thus determined, he embraced the Lady in his arms, (for all this while &s;he was not awaked out of her enchanted &s;leep) and &s;et her on the hor&s;e of wood. All this <HI>Adrimain</HI> was eye-wit|ne&s;s of, and &s;aid thus unto him: My Lord if you fail one jot of the true u&s;e of the hor&s;e, both your &s;elf and the Lady are in very great danger. Fear not that (quoth <HI>Trompart</HI>) and &s;o turning the Pin, he mounted &s;wiftly into the Air, and before the next morning he was 200 miles on his way, but not at his journeys end, for now a|waked the Lady <HI>Clerimond</HI> out of her own Enchanted &s;leep, who &s;eeing her &s;elf &s;o deluded, fell &s;uddenly into a &s;wound, this chance &s;truck to the heart of King <HI>Trompart,</HI> for he was afraid le&s;t &s;he had been dead, and &s;o turning the pin he &s;toped the Hor&s;e in a fair green field by a Fountain, then taking the Lady from the Hor&s;e, he laid her on the gra&s;s, and took a little water, and ca&s;t it on her
<PB N="152" REF="81"> face, and the Lady recovered, being recovered, &s;he made &s;uch grievous lamentations, that King <HI>Trompart</HI> was well nigh out of his wits: within this place there was a Shepherd, of whom King <HI>Trompart</HI> required &s;omewhat to eat, which he gave unto the La|dy, who eat thereof, and was refre&s;hed: and at la&s;t being come a|gain unto her &s;peech, &s;he weeping, uttered the&s;e words: Vnhappy I above all Creatures, for I have lo&s;t my joy by accur&s;ed trea&s;on, Alas <HI>Valentine</HI> my love, cur&s;ed be he that hath &s;eperated us. <HI>Trom|part</HI> hearing her &s;o clamorous, reproved her roundly, &s;aying: La|dy, leave off the&s;e fooli&s;h words of the Chri&s;tian boy, or el&s;e I &s;hall &s;eperate thy head from thy body; is it not better for thee to be my wife, that am &s;ole Lord of all this juri&s;diction, then to have a beggerly &s;tart-up, that hath neither Land nor Living; and with the&s;e words he would have ki&s;&s;ed her, but the Lady di&s;daining him, hit him with her fi&s;t upon the month.</P>
<P>This &s;trange and unlookt for di&s;dainfulne&s;s, put King <HI>Trompart</HI> into &s;uch an anger, that he in a furious rage caught her up, and &s;et her upon the hor&s;e again, and turning the pin the contrary way, pre&s;ently, in&s;tead of carrying her into his own Country, he lighted in <HI>Inde,</HI> in the mid&s;t of a market-place, kept there that day: the people &s;eeing &s;uch a &s;trange &s;ight; marvelled much thereat. The Lady <HI>Clerimond</HI> by this time, knew the hor&s;e to be <HI>Pacolets,</HI> and &s;aid: Now am I fal&s;ly betrayed, and <HI>Pacolet</HI> robbed of his hor&s;e; but my dear <HI>Valentine,</HI> he it is mo&s;t &s;ticketh at my heart, for now &s;hall I never &s;&eacute;e th&eacute;e more. <HI>Trompart</HI> (thought for all this, that he had been in his own Country) &s;till beating down her pite|ous laments with bitter words. But mark what followed; ty|dings was brought to the King of <HI>Inde,</HI> of what had happened, who commanded them to be brought before him. But this fell out ill for King <HI>Trompart,</HI> for the King of <HI>Inde</HI> knew him well. King <HI>Trompart</HI> being come before the King of <HI>Inde,</HI> he bid him wel|come, for you are he that put my brother to death: wherefore I will be revenged on thee, and &s;o cau&s;ed his head to be &s;mitten off. After, the Lady was led into the Kings Pallace; where he &s;at in his own per&s;on, and he thus &s;aid: Lady, I know now of whence you are, by the bright &s;plendor of your face, it hath enthralled my heart; wherefore if &s;o you plea&s;e to be my Wife, I will make

At la&s;t <HI>Pacolet</HI> came to the Tent where <HI>Adrimain</HI> was; at which <HI>Adrimain</HI> &s;tood amazed, and was &s;o deeply overcome in love, that that night he retained him into his Chamber, but <HI>P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="2 letters">olet,</HI> no whit to &s;eek of his &s;hifts, made &s;omewhat &s;queami&s;h and &s;aid: My Lords know this, I have been de&s;ired of many, but I think fitte&s;t the worthie&s;t to be fir&s;t &s;erved: Daughter (quoth <HI>Adrim<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="3 letters"></HI>) <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="2 letters">ar nothing, make good cheer, and be mer<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">y, for I have a good

<P><HI>Pacolet</HI> being thus higly fea&s;ted in the Tent of <HI>Adrimain,</HI> while <HI>Adrimain</HI> is in the tent of <HI>Ferragus, Pacolet</HI> demanded of the &s;er|vant of <HI>Adrimain,</HI> what was become of King <HI>Trompart:</HI> The &s;er|vant &s;aid: I think he is returned again into his own Country, and carried along with him the Lady <HI>Clerimond</HI> upon a hor&s;e of wood, that my Ma&s;ter had given him. <HI>Pacolet</HI> hearing this, was vexed at the heart.

As he delt with <HI>Adrimain,</HI> &s;o he did with all round a|bout him and putting off his womans attire, he clad him&s;elf in all the riche&s;t cloaths that <HI>Adrimain</HI> had, and after, with his own &s;word cut off his head, and bare it away with him. Having thus done, he takes his way towards the Tent of <HI>Ferragus,</HI> the which he found well guarded, and there by his Art, he al&s;o ca&s;t them all into a heavy &s;leep. This done, he entred into the Tent of <HI>Ferra|gus,</HI> where he &s;uddenly made him leap out of his bed, and cloath him: and tying him in his girdle, made him run by his &s;ide like a Spaniel, till he came even to the very entrance of the gates of <HI>Aqu tain.</HI></P>
<P>When <HI>Pacolet</HI> was come to the gates of the Palace, he found there the Duke him&s;elf, accompanied with many of his Barons, and e&s;pying <HI>Pacolet,</HI> they &s;aid unto him: Where is <HI>Clerimond,</HI> that thou bringe&s;t not her again? he an&s;wered: Lords, be patient a while. I cannot &s;hew you all at once: know this, I am fully revenged on <HI>Adrimain,</HI> for here I have brought his head, and here is <HI>Ferragus,</HI> who by my Art I have al&s;o &s;urprized, as you may &s;ee.

<P>After this great &s;laughter was ended, the Duke returned again into <HI>Aquitain,</HI> and there commanded to have the G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ant <HI>Ferragus</HI> brought before him, who was by this time awaked out of his en|chanted &s;leep, unto <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">hom the Duke thus &s;aid: <HI>Ferragus,</HI> if thou wilt here for&s;ake thy <HI>Mahomet,</HI> and receive Bapti&s;m, then thou &s;halt live: which if thou refu&s;e to do, thou &s;halt &s;urely dye.

<P><HI>Pacolet</HI> (&s;aid <HI>Valentine</HI>) thou ha&s;t well advi&s;ed, and &s;o it &s;hall be effected.

<P>The next morning the Emperor &amp; K. <HI>pepin</HI> diligently brought forth their men to the fight, and divided their Ho&s;t into five Bat|tels.

This battel was extream hot for the Chri&s;tians that day, yet the enemy had no cau&s;e to boa&s;t, K <HI>pepin</HI> behaved him&s;elf &s;o valiantly, and cryed out to his Souldiers, <HI>S. Denis, S.

Then the Souldan thought that he had b&eacute;en betrayed, but yet he made forwards, &amp; rouzed up their courage doubly, in&s;omuch that they inforced the Chri&s;tians to fall back: but little availed their pride, for there came upon them the D. of <HI>Aquitain</HI> with his forces, and a&s;&s;aulted them &s;o fiercely, that they put to the &s;word all that did
<PB N="158" REF="84"> come before them, and thus the Chri&s;tians conquered.</P>
<P>When the battel was ended, and the Chri&s;tians had recovered up their &s;cattered forces, <HI>Valentine</HI> &amp; <HI>Or&s;on</HI> came before the Em|peror, doing unto him dutiful reverence. Father (quoth <HI>Valentine</HI>) here you may behold my Brother <HI>Or&s;on,</HI> whom as yet you never knew, then the Emperor imbraced him with tears, and &s;o did the worthy King <HI>Pepin</HI> al&s;o.

<P>By this time they are come, when the Emperor &s;aw his wife <HI>Belly&s;ant,</HI> he leapt off his hor&s;e, and in tears and &s;ighs, not being able to &s;peak, he embraced her: and <HI>Valentine</HI> and <HI>Or&s;on</HI> bare them company in their lamentations, &s;o did al&s;o many of the re&s;t there a&s;&s;embled. At la&s;t words took place, and the Emperor re|counted all the hard dealings that had proceeded again&s;t the Em|pre&s;s, requiring pardon for what was pa&s;t. My Lord (quoth &s;he) &s;ince it hath &s;o plea&s;ed the Fates to bring me unto your &s;ight, I freely forgive all wrongs, but I long to &s;ee the man that proved my inocency with his &s;word.

<P>THe&s;e wars thus ended, K. <HI>Pepin</HI> took his leave of the Emperor and returned into <HI>France. Or&s;on</HI> would n&eacute;eds go along with his Vncle <HI>Pepin,</HI> and &s;pend the remainder of his days in his Ser|vice.

Sir (quoth he) willingly, and am ready when&s;oever you &s;hall &s;et forward. Then <HI>Valentine</HI> made all things in a readine&s;s for his departure, and now hath ta|ken Sea and left his Crown and Country, only accompanied with thr&eacute;e attendants.

If ought was to be brought before the King, <HI>O<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;on</HI> was the man to be &s;ued unto.</P>
<P>This greatne&s;s of <HI>Or&s;on</HI> fretted <HI>Haufray</HI> and <HI>Henry</HI> (of whom you have heard before) to the heart, in&s;omuch that they plotted a means how to take away his life, &s;aying, it was much to their in|dignity that <HI>Or&s;on</HI> &s;hould be thus preferred before them, being &s;ons unto the King: &s;urely, &s;ays the one to the other, his glory can|not long endure, for his own pride will be his overthrow. I but (&s;aid <HI>Haufray</HI>) under&s;tand me, we have two Nephews, &s;ons unto our elde&s;t &s;i&s;ter, to wit, <HI>Florence</HI> and <HI>Garnier,</HI> the&s;e are both hardy &amp; fierce, and by them methink &s;ome plot might be &s;et on foot: again, they are fit members to execute any villany, for one is Butler un|to the King, the other is V&s;her unto his private Chamber: now either of the&s;e may enter into the Kings Chamber, and murther him in his bed, and &s;uch a deed being done, it will &s;urely be laid to <HI>Or&s;ons</HI> charge, for he onely hath the guard of his per&s;on. If this can be effected, <HI>Or&s;on</HI> will &s;urely be condemned to death, and the Realm wholly light into our hands. In this it is nece&s;&s;ary to u&s;e &s;ecrecy.</P>
<P>Vpon this re&s;olution, they &s;ent for the&s;e two in&s;truments of murther to acquaint them with the trea&s;on, and being come <HI>Hau|fray</HI> &s;aid unto them: Sirs, I and my Brother have laid a plot to do us good, and rai&s;e you to honour, which thing we chu&s;e rather to offer unto you, for that you are allied unto us, and therefore we re&s;pect you before other. This it is, you know our Father the K<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ng never loved us, but hath ever advanced &s;trangers, and left us &s;lightly re arded; the&s;e things con&s;idered, my Brother, I and you two brothers, de<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">cended from our Vncle, determine to put our doting Father to death &amp; &s;o we may &s;hare the Land into our own government. This thing by us fir&s;t plotted, were fite&s;t to be exe|cuted by one of you, and I think you, <HI>Garnier,</HI> to be the fite&s;t for it, becau&s;e you being V&s;her in the Kings Chamber, you may convey your &s;elf behind &s;ome Arras, and when the King is in Bed mur|ther him. This being done, when it &s;hall be known that the King
<PB N="161" REF="85"> is &s;lain, the fact will be &s;aid upon <HI>Or&s;on,</HI> for he only hath the charge of his body, and &s;o we &s;hall quickly get him adjudged to death; and as for little <HI>Charles,</HI> we &s;hall do well enough to make him away-Vncle (&s;aid <HI>Garnier</HI>) doubt not, but that I &s;hall undertake this en|terprize. Shortly after, <HI>Garnier</HI> on a night, when the King was at &s;upper, got a knife, and &s;ecretly entred into the Kings Chamber, and hid him&s;elf behind the Hangings. When the hour of y^e Kings going to bed came, he was attended by his Guard, and Chamber|lain, as the manner was: the King being laid, every man de|parted, &s;ave only <HI>Or&s;on,</HI> who conferred with the King t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">he fell a&s;leep: <HI>Or&s;on</HI> &s;eeing the King a&s;leep, without making noi&s;e, left him, and laid him&s;elf down upon a Pallat by him.</P>
<P>The dead time of the night was come, wherein <HI>Garnier</HI> a&s;&s;ayed (having the knife ready) this bloody enterprize: but being come to the beds &s;ide, ready to lift up his arm to &s;trike the fatal &s;troak, he thought the King would awaken, and &s;o trembling for fear laid him down by the beds &s;ide, and dur&s;t not &s;tir: Anon he would ad|venture again, but being (as before) po&s;&s;e&s;t with fear, he put the knife within the bed, then he returned to the place from whence he came. <HI>Or&s;on</HI> all the while &s;lept &s;oundly, mi&s;doubting nothing, but yet was troubled with a frightful dream, which was, that one would have robbed his wife of honour: al&s;o he thought, that be|&s;ide a river he &s;aw two Herrons, who fought with a Hawk but the Hawk defended her &s;elf &s;o valiantly, as he had &s;lain the two Her|rons, had they not been a&s;&s;i&s;ted by a multitude of little birds, and the Herrons likewi&s;e had &s;lain the Hawk, but that an Eagle re&s;cu|ed him.</P>
<P>At this Dream <HI>Or&s;on</HI> awaked and was much a&s;tonied thereat, &s;aying: The Gods pre&s;erve my Brother <HI>Valentine</HI> from Trea&s;ons. By this time the day broke and <HI>Or&s;on</HI> &s;oftly &s;tole out of the cham|ber, fearing to awaken the King. When <HI>Garn<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">er</HI> &s;aw <HI>Or&s;on</HI> gone, he al&s;o followed &s;oon after, and took his way towards y^e cham|ber, where he found the two brethren, who longing to hear y^e news, <HI>Garnier</HI> (quoth they) tell us what is done? Lords, (&s;aid <HI>Garnier</HI>) I would not do the like again for all the gold in <HI>France,</HI> and yet I have not hurt the King, for &s;till as I was lifting up my hand to &s;trike, fear and horrour did &s;o affright me, that I dur&s;t no more
<PB N="162" REF="86"> adventure. But I have advi&s;ed me of another plot, and have of purpo&s;e left the knife in the Kings bed and this it is, we will acu&s;e <HI>Or&s;on</HI> of trea&s;on, and tell the King there are four Traitors, where|of <HI>Or&s;on</HI> is the principal. Al&s;o, they will make away little <HI>Charles,</HI> and &s;o wholly po&s;&s;e&s;s the Crown. To prove this, we will &s;ay, that for this purpo&s;e <HI>Or&s;on</HI> hath conveyed a knife into the Kings bed, if any demand how we know thereof, we will &s;ay, one of us &s;tanding at the door, heard all their conference. <HI>Garnier</HI> (&s;aid <HI>Haufray</HI>) you &s;ay well, but if <HI>Or&s;on</HI> deny it, you and your brother &s;hall crave com+bat again&s;t him, &s;ay that by &s;uch adventure you come by the wor&s;e, my b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">other and I &s;hall find men enough to re&s;cue you. Thus they re&s;olved, and thus was trea&s;on &s;aid the &s;econd time for <HI>Or&s;on</HI> the inocent. The next day the King being at dinner, attended by <HI>Hau|fray</HI> and <HI>Henry,</HI> who &s;hewed good countenance to <HI>Or&s;on:</HI> when <HI>Garni<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">r</HI> &s;aw his time, he came before the King, &s;aying; Worthy King, your Grace hath be&s;towed on me many Kingly favours, wherefore it is m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter"> duty to open unto you a Trea&s;on which lately I chanced to hear and to the end you may have a care of your per|&s;on, I will bewray unto you the practi&s;ers thereof.</P>

<P><HI>Valentine</HI> having travelled long, at la&s;t arrived in the City of <HI>Antioch,</HI> thinking to find the Lady <HI>Clerimond.

What is it (qd. <HI>Va|lentine</HI>) for I will do any thing to &s;ave my life. The King &s;aid, you mu&s;t either renounce your Chri&s;tian faith, or el&s;e fight with a dreadful Dragon that hath devouted many men: &s;he is bigger then a hor&s;e, winged like a fowl, feathered like a Griffon, the head of a Serpent, a great &s;ting within her mouth, a fierce look, the skin covered with red &s;cales, and &s;he hath the feet of a Lyon. Quoth <HI>Valentine,</HI> this is &s;ome hideous Mon&s;ter, yet will I try my fortune again&s;t her, if you will but grant me one reque&s;t, which is, that if I conquer this Dragon, you will then change your <HI>Mahometry</HI> and become Chri&s;tians. The King bound it with an Oath that he would, for there were never any yet returned alive that attempted it. Sir (qd. <HI>Valentine</HI>) let me have about or two with this Mon&s;ter. Then he cau&s;ed a Shield to be made, and thereon fa&s;tned a great number of long &s;pickes of &s;t&eacute;el, a foot long, as &s;harp as needles.</P>
<P>This &s;hield being made, <HI>Valentine</HI> put on Armor, and buckling on his Helm, then grided his &s;word to his &s;ide, took leave of his men, and mounted his hor&s;e, i&s;&s;ued out of the City. Being gone, every one got up into their windows to behold the fight. Now they of the City were fain to provide for the Dragon, either the Car|ka&s;s of a man, or of a bea&s;t, which if they failed of, none dur&s;t ven|ture out of the City: but having eaten her prey, &s;he would return unto her Den again, without doing any harm. All &s;uch Malefact|ors as any wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter"> had de&s;erved death, were continually thrown unto this fearful Mon&s;ter; but if they had no Malefactors, then they went to the Sea-&s;ide, for to take up Chri&s;tians, if they hapned to come on &s;hore, and they were brought to be devoured of the Dragon.</P>
<P>Now by this time is <HI>Valentine</HI> within the &s;ight of the Dragon; &s;he &s;&eacute;eing one come towards her, clo&s;ed her wings mo&s;t fierce|ly, ca&s;ting out of her mouth &s;moak like fire.

The King beholding this, &s;aid: S&eacute;e yonder is a mo&s;t va|liant Knight, whom we ought to reverence for his hardine&s;s.

<P>Now grew the battel fierce and dangerous between <HI>Valentine</HI> and the Dragon, but &s;till &s;he fearing the pricks of the Shield, by which he held her play. In the one hand bare his &s;hield, and the other his &s;word, wherewith he gave the &s;erpent a marvellous blow under the ear, but with the blow he brake his Sword. <HI>Valentine</HI> was in great danger when his &s;word was broken, for y^e bea&s;t grew &s;o angry, that with her paw &s;he rent his Armor quite through. <HI>Va|lentine</HI>

Now is the time expired, and all this while appeareth no &s;uccour for her relief, which &s;he had &s;o long expected: Therefore (poor Lady) now is &s;he put to her &s;hifts, and to &s;ave her Maiden-head, &s;he feigned her &s;elf very &s;ick. This news came to the Kings ear, that the fair <HI>Clerimond</HI> was extream &s;ick, at which he grew very &s;ad, and came to vi&s;it her, at la&s;t he would have put his hand upon her head, to have held it, but &s;he refu&s;ing, took his arm, and lift up her head her &s;elf, making &s;igns that &s;he would bite him, at which action he wondred, and grew much a&s;tonied thereat.</P>
<P>After this &s;he rowle her eyes up and down, and made grive|ous faces, in &s;uch wi&s;e, that the King got him out of the Chamber, fearing le&s;t &s;he &s;hould prove mad. In this manner &s;he abode a long time, and &s;he did act the matter &s;o well, that within fifteen days &s;he &s;eemed more like a bea&s;t then a woman: &s;he made all her At|tendants for&s;ake her, for if &s;he caught them, &s;he would leave &s;ome mark behind her, &s;o they left her alone, giving her meat at the window, for none would come near her. One while &s;he put her &s;mock upermo&s;t, anon &s;he bedawbed her face with foot, and in this e&s;tate the King came and beheld her, lamenting her di&s;temper, and
<PB N="174" REF="92"> &s;aid unto her: Lady, now is the time come that I &s;hould have had you to wife, therefore be comforted, and be not thus impatient.</P>
<P>The Lady under&s;tanding him well made &s;hew as if &s;he would hear him, but then &s;he fell into a &s;tronger fit of madne&s;s; one while &s;he would run again&s;t the chimney, another while fall into a great laughter, then &s;it down and make faces, and all to pre&s;erve her cha&s;tity. Many ways was tryed for her recovery, yet none pre|vailed: &s;o leave we her in her chamber, and return to <HI>Valentine,</HI> who with an ardent de&s;ire is roved abroad, accompanied with <HI>Pa|colet,</HI> to find out the Lady <HI>Clerimond.</HI> Long have they travelled to find out the Lady <HI>Clerimond,</HI> and now were they arrived in <HI>E&s;|clardy,</HI> which was the Kingdom of <HI>Tro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">part,</HI> who carried away the Lady on <HI>Pacolets</HI> hor&s;e. Being in the City, they asked for K. <HI>Trompart,</HI> &s;o they told him he was &s;lain by the King of <HI>Inde,</HI> and that now at this pre&s;ent, <HI>Lucar</HI> his Son would revenge his death upon the King of <HI>Inde,</HI> and to that end he had newly mu&s;tred up his powers, and waged many royal Kings to undertake this war. Then &s;pake <HI>Pacolet,</HI> who well under&s;tood the language, &s;aying; Of what account is this K. <HI>Lucar?</HI> for the ho&s;t where he lay told him, that he &s;hould &s;hortly marry with the daughter of <HI>Brandiffer,</HI> that was late wife to the King of <HI>Antioch,</HI> who was &s;lain by <HI>Brandiffer,</HI> for that he for&s;ook his Religion.</P>
<P>At this tale <HI>Valentine</HI> was much aba&s;hed, and wondred at this &s;udden alteration: but at la&s;t he &s;aid; Know ye not what is become of the Lady that King <HI>Trompart</HI> did bring with him? Of her we hear no tydings (quoth the Ho&s;t:) tell me then where is K. <HI>Lucar</HI> at this pre&s;ent, I would fain &s;erve under him for wages, for my money is fallen &s;hort, and I have a great de&s;ire to follow the wars. Marry, &s;aid the Ho&s;t, King <HI>Lucar</HI> is in <HI>E&s;clardy,</HI> and there you &s;hall find him accompanied with a huge Hoa&s;t, and attendeth <HI>Brand ffer</HI> to receive his daughter in Wedlock. <HI>Valentine</HI> know|ing all this, he hoped to hear of <HI>Clerimond;</HI> and &s;o he departed, and came to <HI>E&s;clardy,</HI> to &s;erve King <HI>Lucar.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Lucar</HI> being in the City of <HI>E&s;clardy,</HI> thither came <HI>Brandiffer</HI> with his daughter, at &s;ight of whom K. <HI>Lucar</HI> was joyful, but the Lady was &s;ad, for of all other &s;he could never affect him. The La|dy was led into the Hall, and there married unto King <HI>Lucar.
<PB N="175" REF="92"> Valentine</HI> was abroad, and entring a wood, he heard the crying voice of a woman, whom a Sarazen would have ravi&s;hed: <HI>Valen|t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ne</HI> &s;till heard the cry, and &s;aid unto <HI>Pacolet:</HI> Ride fa&s;ter, for this cry is more and more in my ear, and we &s;hall do a charitable deed, in relieving the opre&s;&s;ed.

<P><HI>Pacolet,</HI> thou &s;peake&s;t fooli&s;hly for he is not worthy the name of a Knight, that will not aid in time of nece&s;&s;ity: &s;o he rode up and down the wood, till at la&s;t he lighted on the Sarazen, that had gotten a Lady under him. Then <HI>Valentine</HI> &s;aid: My friend, for&s;ake your Lady, or el&s;e betake you to your arms, and combat with me, for you may well perceive &s;he loveth you not.

The&s;e words pa&s;t, he left the Lady, and mounted his hor&s;e, and then took his &s;hield and &s;pear, and being prepared, they &s;et out one at the other &s;o fiercely, that <HI>Valentine</HI> ran his &s;pear quite through the body of the Pagan, in&s;omuch as he fell down dead. Then went <HI>Valentine</HI> to the maiden, &s;aying; Damo&s;el, now is your enemy laid in the du&s;t, but I pray &s;hew me the cau&s;e why this man brought you into this wood: Sir, I will tell nothing &s;ave the truth: So it was, that ye&s;ternight late he came into my fathers hou&s;e to lodge, and there attempting the u&s;e of my body, but could not, he departed from me, and went into the Chamber of my Father, and there flew him. Afterward he thought he &s;hould &s;urely have got his will on me, in this manner as you &s;ee, from which by your manhood I am freed, and mine honour &s;aved, do with me what plea&s;eth you, for your body hath ran&s;omed mine, and be&s;ides, as you have won me, I yield me to your plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>Damo&s;el, by me thou &s;hall receive no wrong, return unto your hou&s;e, and keep well your cha&s;tity.

Then he called <HI>Valentine</HI> unto him, and &s;aid: Knight, &s;ear not death, but know that above all men, I love and hold you dear, you and all yours I receive into my pay: marry, one thing yet re|maineth, which you mu&s;t do for me, which is, that you go into <HI>Inde,</HI> and defie the King thereof in my name, telling him that I am ready prepared to avenge the death of my Father, whom he hath &s;hamefully put to death, except he come pre&s;ently before me with a Cord about his neck, ready to receive &s;uch &s;entence, as by me and m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter"> Barons &s;hall be impo&s;ed upon him: if he deny it, tell him I will &s;hortly vi&s;it him and his Land with war, and not leave one Town or Village unran&s;acked, nor &s;pare the life of an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">.

<P>When the King &s;aw <HI>Brandiffer</HI> ordering his men in Battel ar|ray, he left his companies, with much dilligence he rode towards y^e Pavillion of the Ladies: Now when <HI>Rozamond</HI> beheld it was he, &s;he gave all the re&s;t of her company the &s;lip, and ran violently into his arms, who joyfully received her.

<P>It is a common &s;aying, women &s;eldom want deceit, as here it appeareth in <HI>Rozamond,</HI> for &s;ome four days after, &s;he rode forth of her Tent, pretending to take the air, but took her way toward the King of <HI>I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">de,</HI> &amp; had given him intelligence of her intent, wil|ling him, that when he &s;aw her out of danger, &s;uddenly to come and &s;eize her as his pri&s;oner, and &s;o carry her away.

Every one looked for nothing but death, &s;ave only <HI>Or&s;on,</HI> and he bear it it out comfortably, &s;aying: Lords, let us yet tru&s;t to my Brother <HI>Valentine</HI> and <HI>Pacolet,</HI> who by inchant|ment can do much, but he little knew that the Ca&s;tle was impreg|nable. <HI>Brandiffer</HI> having thus made all &s;ure, called before him his daughter <HI>Galazy,</HI> and &s;aid unto her: I mu&s;t depart to &s;atisfie mine Army: being there, I &s;hall meet with the <HI>Indian</HI> King, and <HI>Lucar,</HI> both which will aid me again&s;t the <HI>French,</HI> that holdeth the City of <HI>Angory;</HI> therefore k&eacute;ep well my Pri&s;oners, &s;o he departed.

<P>The two Kings gathered up their Forces, and took their way towards <HI>Angory:</HI> whither being come, <HI>Valentine</HI> had knowledge thereof, who kept the City for K. <HI>Pepin.</HI> This amazed much the Noble <HI>Valentine,</HI> when he &s;aw the Tents &s;o nigh him: At la&s;t he cal'd <HI>Pacolet</HI> unto him, &s;aying; I wonder I hear not of my Vncle <HI>Pepin.</HI> Fear not (&s;aid <HI>Pacolet</HI>) for e're long we will hear better news: and therewithal departed from <HI>Angory,</HI> and never re&s;ted till he came unto the Camp of K. <HI>Lucar,</HI> who e&s;pying him, demanded of him what news, and what was become of his Ma&s;ter, who &s;o long time he had &s;erved: <HI>Pacolet</HI> an&s;wered: Sir, he is long &s;ince dead, and I am come to &s;eek a new Ma&s;ter. Quoth <HI>Lucar,</HI> Wilt thou &s;erve me? Yes (quoth <HI>Pacolet.</HI>) Thus was he received into his &s;ervice, but he ill rewarded his new Ma&s;ter, for the &s;ame night by Enchantment, he ca&s;t <HI>Lucar</HI> into &s;uch a &s;leep, that he carried him into the City of <HI>Angory. Valentine</HI> was right glad of this; and <HI>Lu|car</HI> being placed before a fire, the enchantment cea&s;ed, and he a|waked. Being awaked, he became &s;ore a&s;tonied to &s;ee him&s;elf thus betrayed, and at la&s;t <HI>Pacolet</HI> &s;aid unto him: Ma&s;ter, I am
<PB N="198" REF="104"> at your &s;ervice, have you an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter"> thing to command me? At the which words <HI>Lucar</HI> grew much enraged, and taking a knife, gave <HI>Paco|let</HI> &s;uch a wound, that he fell down dead. <HI>Valentin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI> &s;eeing this ac|cident, was exceeding &s;orrowful, and &s;aid: Such another friend &s;hall I never have. Fal&s;e Traitor (quoth he) thou ha&s;t &s;lain him that was all my hope, if thou ha&s;t thou &s;halt &s;urely pay for it. Then &s;aid <HI>Lucar,</HI> I am glad that I have &s;lain that Traitor.</P>
<P>Now <HI>Valentine</HI> went towards the dead Corps, and took out of his bo&s;ome a pair of writing Tables, in which was written the whole manner of his Art. The&s;e Tables had <HI>P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">colet</HI> ever made <HI>V<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">lentine</HI> acquainted withal, wi&s;hing him that if he out-lived him, he &s;hould make great account of them; &s;o <HI>Valentine</HI> put them up, and after made u&s;e of them. Here would <HI>Va<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">entine</HI> have King <HI>Lucar</HI> put to death, but being better advi&s;ed, he was &s;afely kept in pri&s;on, for if &s;o be that an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter"> worthy per&s;onage &s;hould be taken by the Pagans, then the body of <HI>Lucar</HI> &s;hould &s;erve for ran&s;ome of the other. Thus <HI>Valentine</HI> cau&s;ed the body of <HI>Pacolet</HI> to be interred in honourable manner, who&s;e death was much bewailed of all.</P>
<P>The next morning there aro&s;e an out-cry throughout the Army, that <HI>Lucar</HI> was gone no man knew how: among&s;t the re&s;t, <HI>Bran|differ</HI> made great lamentation, till one told him that he was in <HI>Angory,</HI> and how he had &s;lain <HI>Pacolet, Brandiffer</HI> was glad <HI>Pacolet</HI> was &s;lain, but &s;orry for <HI>Lucar:</HI> at la&s;t calling to him a me&s;&s;enger, he &s;ent to <HI>Valentine,</HI> to ask him if he would deliver <HI>Lucar,</HI> for K. <HI>P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">pin,</HI> or the Emperor, or <HI>Or&s;on,</HI> or any other of the twelve Peers of <HI>France:</HI> the me&s;&s;enger departed on his way with the&s;e conditi|ons; and coming to the City of <HI>Angory,</HI> de&s;ired to &s;peak with <HI>Va|lentine:</HI> After &s;alutations on both parts, he declared his me&s;&s;age, from King <HI>Brandiffer. Valentine</HI> hearing the effect of his me&s;&s;age, was much amazed, and &s;aid to the Me&s;&s;enger: How cometh it to pa&s;s, that <HI>Brandiffer</HI> can make choice of all the&s;e valiant men, how became they his Pri&s;oners? Quoth the Me&s;&s;enger, I think it is not unknown, how that King <HI>Pepin,</HI> accompanied with the twelve Peers of <HI>France,</HI> not long &s;ince went to <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> and having among&s;t them one Traitor, was delivered into the hands of <HI>Bran|differ,</HI> and by him taken in <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> and committed to pri&s;on: Wherefore having thus related unto you the truth; &s;aid: will you

Me&s;&s;enger, I &s;hall give an&s;wer to thee anon: &s;o entring into the Hall, he a&s;&s;embled unto him all his coun&s;el, &s;aying to them: Thus it is, that for our pri&s;oner <HI>Lu|car,</HI> we may have delivered us, either my Father, or my Brother, or my Vncle King <HI>Pepin:</HI> now in this cau&s;e let us re&s;olve what is to be done. The Lords replyed, you are mo&s;t bound to your natu|ral Father, and therefore we judge it mo&s;t meet to relea&s;e him.</P>
<P>Lords (quoth <HI>Valentine</HI>) you have well advi&s;ed, but yet I am determined to do otherwi&s;e, for you all know that my Mother was wrongfully bani&s;hed, and in her exile brought me forth, and my brother in the forre&s;t of <HI>Orleance,</HI> where we might both have b&eacute;en devoured of bea&s;ts if mine Vncle K. <HI>Pepin</HI> had not taken me up.

When the Barons had heard the wi&s;dom of <HI>Valentine,</HI> they agreed all with one voice, that he had nobly &s;poken. Then called they unto them the Me&s;&s;en|ger of <HI>Brandiffer,</HI> and &s;aid: Friend, return this an&s;wer to thy Ma|&s;ter, tell him that I &s;hall willingly yeild the body of K. <HI>Lucar,</HI> upon condition that he deliver unto us the body of K. <HI>Pepi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">:</HI> &s;o after due reverence done, the Me&s;&s;enger departed.

<P>YOu have heard already, that K. <HI>Pepin</HI> brought news unto <HI>Va|lentine</HI> of the Lady <HI>Clerimond</HI> which having heard it would not out of his mind, at la&s;t he re&s;olved to pa&s;s from <HI>Angory,</HI> to <HI>In|dia,</HI> accompanied with one Squire, &amp; in the &s;hape of a Phy&s;itian, he went to Sea with the <HI>Indian</HI> Merchants, being arrived, he lay in the City at an Inn-holders hou&s;e till his Gown and other habili|ments were in a readine&s;s. At his fir&s;t entrance in this Inn, the Ho&s;t asked him what he was, he &s;aid, a Phy&s;itian, and can cure any manner of di&s;ea&s;e. The Ho&s;t believed him, and his Squire &s;erved him as his Apothecary or Clerk. In this manner, lying there a|bout &s;ome 3 days, he called his Ho&s;t to him, and de&s;ired him to get a man to go about the City, to make known his Art, and &s;ee who needeth help, that I may cure them, for I would fain get &s;ome|thing to defray my charge while I lye in your hou&s;e; but in the mean &s;pace, rather than you &s;hall mi&s;tru&s;t me, I will leave you a good pawn: Marry (qd. the Ho&s;t) with all my heart, I accept your gage: So <HI>Valentine</HI> delivered him a rich Mantle, Furred quite through with co&s;tly Furrs, and bad him bring before him that party, that &s;hould make known his Art. The Ho&s;t went out, and brought him a ragged fellow who had not any thing to hang upon him: <HI>Valentine</HI> yet was glad of &s;uch a Fellow as this, and new cloathed him from head to foot, &amp; &s;aid unto him: My friend, go thy ways into the City, &amp; cry about the &s;ame, that there is come a Phy|&s;itian, that can heal all manner of di&s;ea&s;es, even Mad men or Wo|men&punc; he will undertake to cure.</P>
<P>This fellow did as he was commanded, and pa&s;&s;ed from place to place to publi&s;h this Doctors skill.

Being come before the King, he did his obey|&s;ance in the name of the great God <HI>Jupiter,</HI> and the King &s;aid un|to him: Sir, you be welcome to my Court, fir&s;t dine, and then I &s;hall tell you further the cau&s;e of my &s;ending for you.

</FIGURE> &s;uccour of <HI>Bertha</HI> his wife, and to cha&s;ti&s;e the V&s;urper. The King of <HI>Brittain</HI> not thinking what would happen &s;trengthened him&s;elf with all the Forces he could make and &s;ent out proclamation that all that could bear arms &s;hould a&s;&s;i&s;t him into <HI>France.</HI> Hereupon Queen <HI>Bertha</HI> with her young Son <HI>Charles</HI> fled to <HI>Lyons</HI> to &s;eek &s;uccour: At the &s;ame time lived a worthy and tru&s;ty Earl of <HI>An|joy,</HI> who favouring the Queen, and pitying her di&s;tre&s;s, fortified his Ca&s;tle again&s;t the <HI>Brittains,</HI> to whom the Queen &s;ent 4000 Hor&s;e to keep the pa&s;&s;age. At la&s;t the King of <HI>Brittain</HI> bid the Earl give him pa&s;&s;age into <HI>France,</HI> but he an&s;wered, No: Hereup|on there was appointed a band of &s;ouldiers, to lay &s;iege at <HI>Argiers,</HI> but the Earl kept clo&s;e within the City, and would not i&s;&s;ue out thereof. During the &s;iege was King <HI>Pepin</HI> come to <HI>Paris,</HI> &amp; there was joyfully received, when the Queen under&s;tood he was at <HI>Pa|ris,</HI> &s;he ha&s;ted unto him, and when &s;he came before him, in tears, &s;he &s;aid: dear Lord, revenge us on this V&s;urper. Lady (quoth the King) fear it not. So calling about him his Coun&s;ellours, and
<PB N="209" REF="109"> men of war, he made ha&s;te to furni&s;h up his companies, and many there were that voluntarily offered them&s;elves to do the King a|ny &s;ervice. By this time the King of <HI>Brittain</HI> heard that King <HI>Pepin</HI> was come again&s;t him with a great Army, which feared him, and not without cau&s;e. But &s;ee what followed, for his own friends be|trayed him to K. <HI>Pepin,</HI> only to &s;ave their own e&s;tates, and make their peace the better with the King. So re&s;olving hereupon, on a night they came to him, lying on his bed, and led him perforce be|fore K. <HI>Pepin,</HI> who pre&s;ently cau&s;ed his head to be &s;mitten off, with|in the City of <HI>Paris.</HI> Now they thought that betrayed him, all was well, but the King afterwards &s;eized all their Lands into his own hands.</P>
<P>Now was <HI>Valentine</HI> much troubled in mind, how he &s;hould fr&eacute;e the Emperor his Father from impri&s;onment, for he knew well, that the Ca&s;tle was not to be won by War, or Policy, nor by any thing, but by trea&s;on, at la&s;t he re&s;olved on a &s;ubtile plot, and thus it was: He put to Sea 12 &s;hips, manned with 2000 men, and la|den with all maner of riches, as precious &s;tones, and &s;ilks, and thus as Merchants, arrived they before this &s;trong Ca&s;tle.</P>
<P><HI>Valentine</HI> took upon him the &s;hape of a Merchant, &s;etting a rich Crown on his head, and &s;aid unto his men: Be you all privately armed within the &s;hips, &s;o that none of you be &s;&eacute;en, if the Sarazens come aboard, put them to death. Then coming toward the Ca&s;tle gate, with the Crown on his head, the Porter &s;aid: What bring you hither? Friend, &s;aid <HI>Valentine,</HI> I am a Merchant, going into <HI>Spain,</HI> and having many rich commodities, I hear &s;ay, that I might not pa&s;s without a tribute, on pain of death. Said the Porter, I will go to my Lady, and bring you an an&s;wer: &s;o he went to <HI>Galazy,</HI> and told his me&s;&s;age: the Lady under&s;tanding there was &s;uch pre|cious Iewels aboard, &s;he &s;aid unto her Sene&s;chal: Go and receive the tribute due to me, of the Merchant, and take along with you a &s;ufficient company of Souldiers, le&s;t they &s;hould offer you injury. He did as he was commanded, and coming to the Ships, they found ine&s;timable Gems, in&s;omuch as they were ravi&s;hed there|with; &s;o they taking the value of the tribute due to the Lady, &s;ud|denly the Chri&s;tians, that lay hid in the &s;hip, &s;et upon them, &amp; &s;lew them. Then <HI>Valentine</HI> &s;aid unto them; Except we go forwards in
<PB N="210" REF="110"> this enterprize, we &s;hall never gain the Ca&s;tle: Wherefore he cau|&s;ed fifty of his men to put on the Sarazens Gowns over their Ar|mors, and &s;o lading them&s;elves with &s;ilks and precious &s;tones, took their way tawards the Ca&s;tle.</P>
<P>The Porter tyed up the Lyons, let down the draw-bridge, and thir&s;ting after &s;ome great reward, went beyond his bounds, in&s;o|much as <HI>Valentine</HI> led him to the Ships, being come, <HI>Valentine</HI> &s;hewed him their dead bodies, and &s;aid; I will make you like one of the&s;e, if you give me not pa&s;&s;age into this Ca&s;tle. Sir (qd. the Por|ter) I &s;hall do it: why then (qd. <HI>Valentine</HI>) I will reward th&eacute;e. Come, &s;aid the Porter, and bring all tho&s;e men whom you have clad in the habit of the Sarazens, for they cannot be known from them in the Ca&s;tle, and let them enter one by one; which they did: &s;o being en|tred, the Porter &s;hewed them a &s;ecret po&s;tern, which <HI>Valentine</HI> having gotten, cau&s;ed all the doors to be &s;et open, then winded he his horn, at which all tho&s;e in the &s;hips ha&s;ted unto them. Then he entred the chamber of the Lady <HI>Galazy,</HI> who was a&s;tonied there|at: but he &s;aid: Lady, fear not, for I have ventured the Seas, to have a &s;ight of your royal pre&s;ence: then &s;he bad him welcome, and highly fea&s;ted him. <HI>Valentines</HI> men having entred the Ca&s;tle, with their &s;houts &s;o affrighted the Lady, that in weeping manner &s;he &s;aid unto him: Courteous Knight, &s;ave my Virginity. Lady (qd. he) fear not, for there is none that dares attempt any di&s;honour to|wards your per&s;on. By this time all the Pagans within the Ca&s;tle were &s;lain and <HI>Valentine</HI> ha&s;ting unto the Dungeon, did break it open, and cryed out aloud: All you that be alive come forth. <HI>Or&s;on</HI> knowing his voice, replyed: Brother, you are welcome, how came you hither? <HI>Valentine</HI> &s;aid: I am come to &s;et you at liberty. At the&s;e words, the Emperor fell into a &s;wound, but <HI>Orlon</HI> &s;uddenly recovered him: then they came out of the Dungeon, in ragged cloaths, and ill-coloured faces; but the Chri&s;tians revelled for the &s;pace of 7 days in the Ca&s;tle, and <HI>Or&s;on</HI> falling in love with <HI>Gala|zy,</HI> after the death of <HI>Fezon</HI> married her, by whom he had a Son (na|med <HI>Or&s;ayr</HI>) who after had the Empire at <HI>Con&s;tantinople.</HI></P>
<P>The&s;e affairs being thus brought to an end, a coun&s;el was called what was be&s;t to be done: at la&s;t they re&s;olved to leave a Gari|&s;on to re&s;i&s;t the enemy: Some &s;aid it was fitting that <HI>Haufray</HI>
<PB N="211" REF="110"> and <HI>Henry</HI> &s;hould undertake this task: but <HI>Haufray</HI> replyed: Not we, for we are determined to go into <HI>France,</HI> to &s;erve our Father. Qd. <HI>Or&s;on,</HI> if you be &s;o re&s;olved, we have &s;mall rea&s;on to weep for your departure, for there is nothing but trea&s;on in you. At the&s;e words <HI>Haufray</HI> and <HI>Henry</HI> was di&s;plea&s;ed, but they dur&s;t not &s;hew it. At la&s;t it was re&s;olved that the Emperor &s;hould take his re&s;t, and his Son <HI>O<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;on,</HI> and the Green Knight &s;hould remain there to de|fend the Ca&s;tle, whil&s;t <HI>Valentine</HI> and the re&s;t adre&s;&s;ed them&s;elves for <HI>Angory.</HI> Now will we look into the trea&s;on of <HI>Haufray</HI> and <HI>Henry,</HI> who being come into <HI>France,</HI> laid a plot to take away the life of their Father, little <HI>Charles</HI> his Son, and <HI>Bertha</HI> the Queen: being come to <HI>Paris,</HI> the King royally fea&s;ted them, &amp; after demand|ed what news of the Emperor, <HI>Valentine, Or&s;on,</HI> and the re&s;t: Qd. the Traitors they were all &s;lain in a battel at <HI>Angory,</HI> at which the King waxed wondrous &s;ad. After this they poy&s;oned the King and Queen. Now little <HI>Charles</HI> was &s;till living; who (as the Gods would have it) hapned under the &s;afe keeping of <HI>Myllon Daugler.</HI></P>
<P>The King and Queen being both thus treacherou&s;ly poy&s;oned, the two Traitors &s;eemed to be exceeding &s;orrowful, but D. <HI>Myllon Daugler,</HI> being a man of a valiant and couragious &s;pirit, forth|with cau&s;ed a coun&s;el to be holden, wherein he would have crowned young <HI>Charles</HI> King of <HI>France,</HI> but <HI>Haufray</HI> and <HI>Henry</HI> by bribes &s;o corrupted the Lords, that <HI>Charles</HI> was held too young. Hereupon D. <HI>Myllon</HI> was committed to pri&s;on, for &s;tanding on the Childs part, and <HI>Charles</HI> held as a Kitchen boy.</P>
<P>A little after, it hapned that <HI>Haufray</HI> commanded <HI>Charles</HI> to turn a &s;pit, but the boy being full of Maje&s;ty, took up the &s;pit, and felled him to the earth. At this, out &s;teps <HI>Henry,</HI> thinking to &s;mite the child, but he being ready to receive him, gave him &s;uch a box on the ear, that the blood i&s;&s;ued out of his mouth. Then <HI>Haufray</HI> commanded his men to lay hold upon him, but there came a Knight which took <HI>Charles</HI> by the hand, and conve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ed him to <HI>Pa|ris.</HI> The Traitors perceiving <HI>Charles</HI> was gone, made out after him, but he could not be found. Hereupon D. <HI>Myllon</HI> told his wife thereof who was &s;i&s;ter to <HI>Charles.</HI> The Lady could not behold the &s;ame for tears, but vowed that they &s;hould dearly pay for the&s;e trea&s;ons and forthwith cau&s;ed Letters to be written into <HI>Angory,</HI>

<P>The Emperor hearing that <HI>Brandiffer</HI> had begirt <HI>Angory,</HI> with &s;o huge an Army, re&s;olved to leave the &s;trong Ca&s;tle to the guard of a Knight.

Then the Emperor &s;aid: Lords, let us arm our &s;elves with &s;uch weapons, as here we have &s;eized from the Pagans; which they pre&s;ently did, but this en|terprize was fatal.

<HEAD>CHAP. LII. How at the end of &s;even years, Valentine dyed in the Palace of Con&s;tantinople: and how Or&s;on turned Hermet.</HEAD>
<P>AT the end of &s;even years, <HI>Valentine</HI> fell into a mortal di&s;ea&s;e, whereof he dyed. Before his death an Angel appeared to him, &s;aying: <HI>Valentine,</HI> thy gla&s;s is run, for within four hours thou &s;halt dye: whereat he greatly rejoyced, making &s;igns for pen, ink, and paper; when he had it, he wrote that it was him&s;elf that appeared like a Pilgrim, and di&s;covered the trea&s;on. After putting to it his Name, he clo&s;ed up the paper, putting in the other half of the King that he had kept; &s;hortly after he laid him down and dyed.</P>
<P>When <HI>Or&s;on</HI> &s;aw that he was dead, he was troubled in mind. The poor man being dead, held a letter in his hand, which <HI>Or&s;on</HI> would have taken out, but could not: then came <HI>Clerimond,</HI> and as &s;oon as &s;he laid hold thereon, the hand opened it &s;elf. <HI>Clerimond</HI> breaking up the Letter, and knowing the half King, &s;aid: Lords, we &s;hall &s;hortly hear news of <HI>Valentine:</HI> So a Secretary was cal|led to read it: at the reading hereof, great lamentation on each

Now great preparation were made for his Funeral Rites, he was in|terred in great magnificence in <HI>Con&s;tantinople. Clerimond</HI> after|ward betook her to a &s;ingle life. Thus having &s;hown the death of <HI>Valentine,</HI> and what became of <HI>Clerimond;</HI> Let us return to <HI>Or&s;on</HI> who ruled the Empire of <HI>Con&s;tantinople</HI> &s;even years, and by his &s;econd Wife <HI>Galazy,</HI> he had a Son named <HI>Mo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ant,</HI> who after was King of <HI>Angory.</HI></P>
<P>After 7 years were expired <HI>Galazy</HI> dyed, for whom the Emperor <HI>Or&s;on</HI> was exceediag &s;orrowful, and in the end betook him to the Woods, where as he fed on Bread and Roots, and &s;uch as he found. It happened one night that he &s;aw a Vi&s;ion, it &s;eemed to him more glorious then his tongue could utter. After this Vi&s;ion he awaked, and being a&s;tonied hereat, with tears he came to the Gr&eacute;en Knight, and &s;aid: Sir I &s;&eacute;e the uncertainty of the world for which I am willing to re&s;ign my e&s;tate and Children unto you: &s;&eacute;e them well educated, that they may by you be made fit to govern &s;uch a people, for I will &s;pend the re&s;t of my days in &s;olitary contemplation. When the Gr&eacute;en Knight had heard the&s;e words, he wept bitterly, but <HI>Or&s;on</HI> recomforted him, &s;aying: W&eacute;ep not, but pray for me, as I for you, that you may accompli&s;h that which I put you in tru&s;t withal. With this <HI>Or&s;on</HI> departed, chargeing the Green Knight not to tell it to any. So taking his way towards a Wood, he there &s;pent the remainer of his days. The Green Kt. after &s;o governed his children that they carefully &s;pent their time on earth, and followed their Father to his Grave.</P>
