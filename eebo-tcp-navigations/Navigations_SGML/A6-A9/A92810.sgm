<HEAD>The Preface TO THE READER.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Courteous Reader,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>HAving lately peru&s;ed a little Book, called HIND's Ram|ble, or a Hi&s;tory of his pranks and Exploits, and finding ma|ny of his Knaveries undi&s;covered, I thought good to publi&s;h to the World the&s;e en&s;uing Stories of him as a &s;ec<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">nd part, to give Gen|tlemen and Travellers direction to avoyd many dangers, which they may fall into: and to give you, as neer as I can, a more per|fect character of him. This <HI>James Hinde</HI> was by his Country, <HI>Gloce&s;ter&s;hire,</HI> his former profe&s;&s;ion a Butcher, which, had he not been drawn away with ill company, might have maintained him in an hone&s;t
<PB REF="4">way: For Sleights and &s;tratagems none can parallel him: he may be called a Ma|&s;ter in the Art of Theevery, as the cun|ningest and wi&s;e&s;t of the Company, for dif|ficult and dangerous Thefts; he hath the Theory and Practique of the Art: He hath not his name for nought: for when mounted, he is as &s;wift as a Hinde, as ra|pacious as an Eagle, nothing comes ami&s;s: and to palliate all the&s;e, he is a fine compa|nion, facetious and witty: and to be &s;hort, he hath more tricks then a hundred of his fraternity: &s;o much for his character.</P>
<P>And thus, courteous Reader, have I gi|ven a true relation, in this various and plea|&s;ant Hi&s;tory, of the wicked pollicies of HINDE and his Companions, that thou may be forewarned of unhappily falling into their dangers; al&s;o it may &s;erve as a warn|ing peece to tho&s;e that are wickedly inclined, that they may be led from the Precipice of Perdition into the &s;afe way of Vertue and Hone&s;ty.</P>

Since thou art &s;o gallant, thou &s;halt have fair play for thy Money:</HI> puts up his pi&s;tol, di&s;mounts al&s;o, and draws his &s;word; and having made a clo&s;e or two, neither being wounded, <HI>Hind</HI>
<PB N="5" REF="6">would as willingly have been rid of his Game&s;ter, as the Gentleman would have been of him; But ere they could agree on the matter, came riding an old Gentleman with a &s;ur|ly Serving-man, who knew the en|gaged Gentleman, and was quickly off his Hor&s;e with his &s;word drawn; Quoth <HI>Hinde, We are two fair game|&s;ters, we need no third man:</HI> Yes al|ways, quoth the Serving-man, <HI>at in and in, which I &s;uppo&s;e is your &s;port;</HI> With that the Gentleman made a clo&s;e with <HI>Hinde,</HI> and quickly the Serving-man had his hand in <HI>Hinde</HI>'s pocket, but drew forth nought but his pi&s;tol, at which <HI>Hinde</HI> yeelded him&s;elf Pri&s;oner.</P>
