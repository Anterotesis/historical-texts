It is therefore declared by the Lords and Commons in Parliament. That who|&s;oever hath beene, or &s;hall be an Actor in the &s;elling or pawning of any of the Iewels of the Crowne, or hath, or &s;hall pay, lend, &s;end, or bring any Money in <HI>Specie</HI> into this Kingdome, for, or upon any of tho&s;e Iewels; Or who&s;oever hath or &s;hall accept of any Bill from beyond the Seas, for the payment of any &s;umme of money for, or upon any of tho&s;e Iewels, and &s;hall pa&s;&s;e any &s;umme according to &s;uch Bill, after notice of this Order, with|out acquainting this Hou&s;e with the receipt of &s;uch Bill before he accept the &s;ame; Or if he have already accepted any &s;uch Bill, then with the ac|ceptance thereof before the payment of the mony, Every &s;uch per&s;on &s;hall be held and accounted a promoter of this intended warre, an enemy to the State, and ought to give &s;atisfaction for this publick dammage out of His owne E&s;tate.</P>
