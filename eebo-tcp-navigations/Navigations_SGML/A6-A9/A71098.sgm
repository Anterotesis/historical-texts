<P>IT was this Con&s;ideration that gave birth to the Ad|venture of the Renowned <HI>Columbus,</HI> That the parts of the Earth and Sea di&s;covered, made up but half the Globe: And he could not imagine that the Wi&s;dom of the Creator would de&s;ign &s;o va&s;t a Compa&s;s as mu&s;t make up the other part only for Fi&s;hes to inhabit &V;pon this principle of rea&s;on, which carried with it a great proba|bility of Succe&s;s, He fir&s;t &s;olicited <HI>Henry</HI> the Seventh of <HI>England;</HI> but being denied there, he made his Addre&s;s to <HI>Ferdinand</HI> King of <HI>Ca&s;tile,</HI> who by the per&s;wa&s;ion of <HI>Elizabeth</HI> his Queen &s;et out a &s;mall number of Ships, which after &s;ome Months &s;ailing We&s;tward (not with|out the murmurings and de&s;pair of the Seamen) at length di&s;covered an unknown, yet habitable World.
<PB REF="5">This Succe&s;s of <HI>Columbus</HI> &s;ounded by the Trump of Fame awakened the &s;loathful and incredulous <HI>World,</HI> who before would believe nothing po&s;&s;ible but what their eyes could behold, or their outward &s;en&s;es fa|thom: The <HI>World</HI> thus awakened, and having wiped their eyes with the <HI>Gold</HI> of <HI>COLUMBINA,</HI> &s;aw more clearly their former Errors: Now the <HI>Golden-Age</HI> returns again <HI>Gold</HI> is exchanged for trifles, &s;uch as Knives, Hatchets, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which were valued at &s;ix times their weight in Gold; and Pearls, and Diamonds bear but an equal value with gla&s;s: But this la&s;ted not long; for immediately &s;uch multitudes of Ships lanched out with expectations of gain, that they &s;oon exhau&s;ted the di&s;covered <HI>Mines,</HI> and reduced it almo&s;t to an equal value with that of <HI>Europe.</HI>

Several Di&s;coveries was made, &s;o that none lo&s;t their labour; and &s;ince that time many places have been di&s;|covered, and yet there remains above a fourth part undi&s;covered; this gave me encouragement to take upon me this Adventure, though not without great trouble and care, &s;uch as the want of many Nece&s;&s;aries for my &s;elf and Seamen, which were much afflicted with a de|&s;perate Sickne&s;s, that did deprive me of mo&s;t of them; but I accidentally met with a ve&s;&s;el that lent me &s;ome of her men, which gave me greater encouragement to pro|ceed in my <HI>Di&s;covery,</HI> which Divine Providence did ble&s;s with &s;ucce&s;s; for in four days after I came out of <HI>Fretum le Mair,</HI> I di&s;covered the Land, which in the following Treati&s;e I give you a relation of.</P>
<P>I do not doubt but this Di&s;covery will be beneficial to <HI>Europe</HI> many ways; fir&s;t as it may encourage &s;everal others to proceed in the like Adventures which may happi|ly find out other Lands, and likewi&s;e the&s;e particular I&s;lands may be beneficial, they being very fruitful, not over-peopled; abounding with many rich Mines, be&s;ides Pearls and precious Stones, with many other rich Com|modities.

<P>ON <HI>January</HI> 1, 1669, We &s;et Sail from <HI>Am&s;terdam</HI> in the Ve&s;&s;el called the <HI>Flying-Faulcon:</HI> The De&s;ign of our Voyage be|ing wholly Di&s;covery. We made way to the <HI>Southern Sea;</HI> the twentieth of <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> following we came to the Streights of <HI>Magalan;</HI> and on the twenty &s;ixth we had a &s;ight of <HI>Terra del Fuega,</HI> by

The Wind at Ea&s;t and by South; we &s;ailed directly before the Wind; and on the tenth of <HI>September</HI> in the Evening we di&s;covered Fire, an a&s;&s;ured te&s;timony of &s;ome Land: but early in the Morning we were better c<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters">firmed in our belief, being in &s;ight of the very Land, and within a mile or thereabouts of it: we Coa&s;ted along &s;everal days, and could &s;py no Towns or Hou&s;es, but di&s;covered many good Ports and Promontaries. On the thir|tieth of <HI>September</HI> we di&s;covered another piece of Land &s;eparate from this by a River or <HI>Fretum,</HI> a League and half in breadth. We &s;till continued our Di&s;covery by Coa&s;ting along this Land likewi&s;e. About the Eighteenth of <HI>November</HI> following we came to the other end of the <HI>Fretum</HI> before di&s;co|vered, by which we knew it to be an I&s;land that we had di&s;covered, and by computation Judg both the I&s;lands to be in Compa&s;s about three hundred Leagues: we ventured into this <HI>Fretum,</HI> and at our entrance, I gave it the name of <HI>Fretum del Schooten.</HI> As we pa&s;&s;ed along we could di&s;cover on the Banks, Peo|ple of an extraordinary &s;ize, and hairy: Having &s;ailed about &s;even Leagues we di&s;covered a River running Ea&s;tward up into the fir&s;t I&s;land; into this River we ventured, and having &s;ailed about a mile, we di&s;covered a Town (as we &s;uppo&s;ed by the great quantity of Smoak that a&s;cended from thence); at
<PB N="3" REF="7">length drawing nearer to it we e&s;pied Hou&s;es, or rather Hills as they &s;eemed to us by their Gra&s;s-Coverings; before this Town we ca&s;t Anchor, and made an Ob&s;ervation, and found our &s;elves in the Latitude of fifty Degrees thirteen Minutes, South; and the Longitude Two hundred &s;eventy five De|grees thirty Minutes. We had not rid at Anchor above three hours before we could e&s;py a <HI>Canoo</HI> coming over to us from the Town; the rea&s;on of which we could not well apprehend; at length draw|ing near to us, we e&s;pied in it an <HI>European,</HI> as his Complexion and Habit did &s;how; he had in his hand a &s;hattered torn Jack-flag, in which we might di&s;|cover &s;omething of the <HI>Portugal</HI> Arms: Being come to the Ship-&s;ide, he &s;aluted us with the&s;e words, <HI>Dios vos guarda hermanos;</HI> which in the <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> language &s;ignifies, <HI>God &s;ave you my Brethren:</HI> I then returned his Salutation in his own language, &s;aying, <HI>Sea bien veni do Hermano.</HI> Welcome Brother; and invited him into the Ship: which Invitation he wil|lingly accepted, and came into the Ship; our Seamen would have taken the men in the <HI>Canoo</HI> into the Ship, but he would not &s;uffer them, telling us they were Slaves, and ought not to be &s;o much Countenanced: We took this <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> into the great Cabin, and gave him the be&s;t Entertainment our Ship could afford; after three or four hours &s;tay in our Ship, he took his leave, and gave us an Invitation to his Hou&s;e, which he told us was in that Town we &s;aw; and promi&s;ed likewi&s;e to &s;end <HI>Canoo's</HI> for the whole Ship's Com|pany, which he accordingly performed in the Mor|ning following.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="8">
The Natives that Rowed in the <HI>Canoo's</HI> were all hairy, having no other Cloathing than what Nature had furni&s;hed them withall; and the lea&s;t of them by computation above Eleven foot high; by the&s;e Gygan|tick men, we were &s;afely conducted to the Town, which con&s;i&s;ted of about a thou&s;and Hou&s;es, built of Timber, and covered over the top with Boughs of Trees wreathed together; and over them were placed very curiou&s;ly Gr<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">en&s;ads, which make their Hou&s;es look like &s;o many Hills covered with Gra&s;s.</P>
<P>At length we were Conducted to this <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> Hou&s;e, who it &s;eems was Governour of this Town, and <HI>Cacique,</HI> or King of that part of the Country: His Hou&s;e was built after the &s;ame manner with the re&s;t, bur much bigger.</P>
<P>At the Entrance to his Hou&s;e he received us with a great deal of Expre&s;&s;ions of Joy, and conducted us into a very fair Room, where we were plentifully entertained with roa&s;ted Veni&s;on, and Wine in abun|dance</P>

<P>I <HI>Va&s;ques de Pagna</HI> &s;et &s;ail from <HI>Lisbon</HI> in the year One thou&s;and &s;ix hundred forty-&s;ix, upon the &s;ame account that you did from <HI>Am&s;terdam,</HI> and by accident made this I&s;land: being curious in the Di&s;covery, I fir&s;t Coa&s;ted about the two I&s;lands, and then put into the <HI>Fretum,</HI> that parts the two I&s;lands; and ob&s;erving this River that runs up into the Country, I ventured into it; re&s;olving to venture &s;o far till I could &s;ee either Hou&s;es or Inhabitants; but by the neglect of my Mate, not being careful enough in &s;ounding the Channel, my Ship unfortu|nately &s;truck upon a Sand, and &s;plit in a very &s;hort time, giving us little &s;pace to &s;hift for our lives; in this &s;treight every Man endeavouring to &s;ave him&s;elf, my &s;elf with two more got &s;afe to the Shore; but of the re&s;t of our Company I never could hear of &s;ince, and therefore conclude they were all drowned. We &s;ought about for &s;helter from the Cold and Rain, it being about the time of the Winter-Sol&s;tice, at which time it is rather Colder than it is with you in <HI>Europe.</HI>
<PB N="6" REF="9">At length we found a large hollow Tree, into which we entred, and &s;lept for that night.</P>
<P>The next Morning as &s;oon as we could &s;ee, we went to the Water-&s;ide to &s;ee whether any thing was driven a &s;hore, or floated near to Land; when we came there we e&s;pied &s;everal pieces of our Ship floa|ting about; and walking along by the &s;hore we found a Barrel of Bisket, and near to that our Jack-Flag, both which we took up and went away very joyfully towards our Arbour, where we &s;ecured them, and gave thanks to God for his great mercy in making &s;uch Provi&s;ion for us: Upon this Bisket we lived a|bout three Months, and &s;pent our time in Prayers, and walking the Grounds near to the Tree, retreating upon the lea&s;t noi&s;e to our Harbour: In the &s;econd Month one of my Companions fell &s;ick and died, and at three Months end my other Companion.</P>
<P>Now was I left in a mi&s;erable Condition, my Com|pany dead, and my Victuals almo&s;t &s;pent; but how|ever I comforted my &s;elf with the&s;e thoughts, that the &s;ame God that hitherto had &s;o plentifully provi|ded for me, would &s;till take care of me; I now re&s;ol|ved to travel up farther into the Country, and if there were any Inhabitants (for as yet I had &s;een none) to commit my &s;elf to their mercy; being thus re&s;olved, I thought to leave &s;ome Memorial behind me, that if it &s;hould happen that any <HI>European</HI> &s;hould light upon this place, they might know what Adventure I had made; I therefore took the Jack-Flag, and with a black-lead Pencil writ the&s;e Words as plain as I could, <HI>Va&s;ques de Pagna of Lisbon was here;</HI> and then &s;ecured it in a convenient place in the Tree,
<PB N="7" REF="9">where it might be &s;ecure from the injuries of weather. Then I took the remainder of the Bisket, and de&s;ired God to pro&s;per my Journey, and travelled into the Country.</P>
<P>In two days travel I di&s;covered hairy people, &s;uch as you &s;ee; at fir&s;t I was &s;omething fearful of them, but my fear was &s;oon taken away, for I found them to be more fearful of me, admiring at my Clothes and Complexion; and were ready to adore me. Walking a little further, I could e&s;py, as it were, a grove of Hills which were their Hou&s;es, who&s;e plea&s;ant Ver|dure was very delightful; being come near to the Town, I was &s;urrounded with hundreds of the&s;e Hairy-people, admiring me, and making offers to adore me, &s;uppo&s;ing I was a god; but I did what I could to hinder them. At length it came to the King's ear, who came him&s;elf with &s;everal Prie&s;ts to vi&s;it me, and made &s;igns to me to let them know what I was; fir&s;t lifting up their eyes to Heaven, and then pointing to me, and then to the Heavens again; but I let them under&s;tand by the like &s;igns, that I did not come immediately from Heaven, but hoped to go thither; and this I did by fir&s;t pointing to the Earth from whence I came, and to the Heavens whe|ther I hoped to go. With which they were well &s;atis|fied, and conducted me to the <HI>Caciques</HI> Hou&s;e (for &s;o they call their Kings): The <HI>Cacique</HI> telling his Prie&s;t (as I have been &s;ince informed by his Daughter my Wife) that I was of Coele&s;tial Extract, and fit for no Company but the Gods and Kings. At this Palace I fared very well; and having very &s;mall hopes of returning to my Country, or &s;eeing any of <HI>Europe,</HI>
<PB N="8" REF="10">I thought it my be&s;t way to a&s;&s;ure my &s;elf of a Being among&s;t them, and this I did by ingratiating my &s;elf with the <HI>Cacique</HI>'s Daughter, whom I found very ready to receive any kindne&s;s from me; her Father likewi&s;e ca&s;ting a plea&s;ant a&s;pect on both, did give me encouragement to make &s;ome offers of Amours, which was kindly received, and we in a &s;hort time married according to the Cu&s;tom of the Countrey; of which with their other Rites and Cu&s;toms, I &s;hall give you a full account hereafter. Being married, he gave me Two hundred Slaves, and bid me chu&s;e out a place in the I&s;land to inha|bit, and build a Town that might be called by my Name.</P>
<P>Having taken my leave, I with my Wife and Slaves with &s;tore of all &s;orts of Provi&s;ion, came towards this place, which I the rather made choice of, becau&s;e it was the place I formerly had taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of; likewi&s;e hoping, that being near to this River, &s;ome <HI>European</HI> might at &s;ome time or o|ther happen to &s;ail into it, as I had done.</P>

Having done this, he carried us into a &s;tately large Room, who&s;e Wall in&s;tead of Tapi&s;try was bedeck't with Flowers and growing Mo&s;s, and chec|ker'd with Boughs after the manner of the <HI>Pyramids</HI> (before mentioned); on the upper end of which, on a Seat or Bank, &s;ate his Lady with Four Children; his Lady was near Twelve Foot high, his Elde&s;t Son, about Twenty years of age, was more than Twelve foot; his Second Son about Six|teen years of age, above Ten foot; his two Daugh|ters
<PB N="10" REF="11">younger, one was Nine foot, and the other Seven foot in heighth. But that which was mo&s;t re|markable, was, that his Second Son and Elde&s;t Daugh|ter were &s;mooth as we are, and yet retained the Nature of the Countrey as to height.</P>
<P>Being pretty well &s;atisfied with our entertainment and diver&s;ions, we de&s;ired his leave to return to our &s;hip, but he would not grant it, telling us that we &s;hould lye there that night; and then conducted us into another large Room, wherein was Hammocks provided for us to lye upon; here he treated us again with two or three Movyles of Wine, (which Mo|vyle contained about a Gallon); having drank up our Wine, he bid us good-night, and left us to our repo&s;e.</P>
<P>Next morning as &s;oon as Sun was up, he came to us, and asked us how we &s;lept, and called for a Movyle of Wine for our Morning's-draught, and cau|&s;ed likewi&s;e &s;ome Veni&s;on to be brought to us, with which having broke our fa&s;t, he carried us to &s;ee his Town, and the Church which he had built.

And that he had converted his Wife, and had baptized her and all the inhabitants of the place, being all as his dome&s;tick Servants; but &s;ince, the people encrea&s;ing, he had con&s;tituted other Prie&s;ts. After this di&s;cour&s;e in the Church, we returned to his Hou&s;e, where he gave order for a Dinner to be provided for us, in the mean time he entertained us with a farther relation of the Govern|ment and Cu&s;toms of this I&s;land in the&s;e words following.</P>

Theft and Murder are here &s;everely puni&s;h|ed with cruel Tortures unto death; &s;o that a &s;tranger may &s;afely travel in this I&s;land without fear of harm, except it be from Bears which lurk in the Woods, with which this I&s;land is well &s;tored.</P>
<P>The Commodities of this I&s;land are Saunders, Palm-trees, Konock a &s;ort of paint, Ca&s;&s;anack a kind of Pults of which they make their bread; great plen|ty of Goats and Deer, Fowl of &s;everal &s;orts, Fi&s;h in abundance, Otters and Beevers good &s;tore. Here are al&s;o &s;everal Gold and Silver Mines, but they are not much regarded by the Inhabitants, they adorning them|&s;elves
<PB N="13" REF="12">more with Pearl and Amber, with which this Country is well &s;tored. Their Drink is Palm-Wine, which they make after this manner: They bore a hole in the tree, and put into the hole a hollow Cane, and at the end of the tap they hang a ve&s;&s;el to catch the liquor: in an hours time if the Tree be any thing large, there will run out a gallon; this liquor is fit to drink pre&s;ently, and is very plea&s;ant and &s;piritous, intoxi|cating the brain, as &s;oon as the mo&s;t generous Wine in <HI>Europe;</HI> here are &s;everal acres of ground yearly plan|ted with the&s;e Trees, which &s;erve for the u&s;e afore|&s;aid. They have here a certain Tree which they call <HI>Cocotonuch,</HI> of the Bark of which they weave a Cloth which &s;erves them for Hammocks and Mantles which they u&s;e in the Winter time; it being full as cold, or colder about <HI>June</HI> as it is in <HI>Europe</HI> in <HI>December.</HI> The people here by rea&s;on of their Temperance and Cha|&s;tity live longer than they do in <HI>Europe;</HI> the genera|lity of them living till they are a Hundred and twenty, or a Hundred and fifty years of age: The like rea&s;on might be given for their extraordinary &s;tature.</P>
<P>The Women here are very comely, and well fea|tured; their faces indifferently &s;mooth, but the Men are &s;o rough and hairy in the face, that they look like &s;o many I&s;land-&s;hocks.</P>
<P>Thus having given you an account of the Country in general, I &s;hall give a particular account of my own Juri&s;diction.</P>

<P>THis part of the I&s;land that you are now in, is called by me <HI>Terra de Pagna</HI> after my own name. My Government and Laws are of two &s;orts, after the man|ner of the <HI>Europeans,</HI> viz. Eccle&s;ia&s;tical and Civil: My elde&s;t Son I have made Judg in all Civil matters; and my &s;econd Son in Eccle&s;ia&s;tical: The Ten Com|mandments is the rule of our Government; the Lords Prayer and Creed the rule and foundation of our De|votion: The&s;e things I have taught them in their own language, and they have them &s;o imprinted in their memory, that I think there is no per&s;on in my bounds that is above ten years of age, but will readily repeat them.</P>
<P>The Limits of my Juri&s;diction is ten Leagues round from the River. In it are four Towns near &s;o big as this, governed by Deputies.</P>

<P>HEre he was interrupted, notice being given that Dinner was ready, unto which we was conducted: Here was a noble Entertainment, with Veni&s;on of &s;e|veral &s;orts, Fowl plenty, and Wine in abundance; his Lady and Children honouring us with their Com|pany. During our &s;itting at Dinner, his Lady who had learnt to &s;peak <HI>Portugue&s;e,</HI> made &s;everal Enquiries of us concerning <HI>Portugal</HI> and <HI>Europe;</HI> asking us if <HI>Europe</HI> was as big as this World &s;he lived in? We told her, That this place was as &s;mall in compari&s;on of <HI>Eu|rope</HI> as this Town was to the whole I&s;land of <HI>Ben|ganga.</HI> After this manner we di&s;cour&s;ed, till night drawing near, put us in mind of going to our Ship; we therefore earne&s;tly de&s;ired leave to depart, which the Governour very unwillingly granted, but made us promi&s;e that (if God would permit) we would re|turn again, or at lea&s;t acquaint the <HI>European</HI> World with this place, and more e&s;pecially his own Coun|try; de&s;iring them to &s;end over &s;ome Religious men to a&s;&s;i&s;t him in planting the Go&s;pel among&s;t the&s;e mi|&s;erably deluded people.</P>
<P>Thus we took our leave, and came to our Ship, where we repo&s;ed for that night, and the next mor|ning
<PB N="16" REF="14">weighed Anchor and hoi&s;ed our Sails, and de|parted, &s;aluting the Town with all our Guns, which we &s;uppo&s;e put the Natives into &s;ome fright, not being acquainted vvith tho&s;e noi&s;es. As we pa&s;&s;ed along the <HI>Fretum</HI> we e&s;pied &s;ome few hairy men of the &s;ame &s;tature with tho&s;e of <HI>Benganga.</HI> Pa&s;&s;ing by a great Mar&s;h, where there was no danger of Ambu&s;h, we ventured a&s;hore, and &s;truck down our Ancient in to|ken of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, giving it the name of <HI>Coma,</HI> by rea&s;on of the Hairy Inhabitants. Having done this, we came again to our Ship, and in Ten Months time arrived at <HI>Am&s;terdam</HI> &s;ufficiently &s;atisfied with our Di&s;covery.</P>

<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="section">
<HEAD><HI>SECT. I.</HI> Of their Qualifications.</HEAD>
<P>FIr&s;t, It is requi&s;ite that they be men of middle age, of a good healthy Con&s;titution, all their Sen&s;es firm, and in their full vigour, that they may be able to go through any dangers or hazards that may happen to them in &s;uch an uncertain Ad|adventure.</P>
<P N="2"><PB REF="15">
II. They mu&s;t be well skill'd in the Arts of Arith|metick, Geometry, Gunnery and Fortification, Tri|gonometry, A&s;tronomy, and Navigation.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="2" TYPE="section">
<HEAD><HI>SECT. II.</HI> Precepts to be ob&s;erved by &s;uch as under|take the&s;e Adeventures.</HEAD>
<P>FIr&s;t, Let them be provided with a good &s;trong Ship, &s;tore of Provi&s;ion, Weapons defen&s;ive and offen&s;ive, with a &s;ufficient quantity of Ammunition, and convenient In&s;truments for pro&s;pection and ob|&s;ervation.</P>
<P N="2">II. Let the Seamen be healthy, &s;tout, re&s;olute Blades, &s;uch as are re&s;olved again&s;t all dangers that may happen.</P>
<P N="3">III. Let them be very curious in their Ob&s;ervati|ons, and calculate the Longitude and Latitude of all places they touch at.</P>
<P N="4">IV. Let them keep their Journal-book exactly; truly and faithfully recording all the pa&s;&s;ages of the Voyage, as the &s;everal changings of the Wind; the rumbs and di&s;tance of &s;ailing upon tho&s;e rumbs; the true &s;ounding of the Channels in tho&s;e Harbours they enter, and what rocks or &s;ands they meet with, giving &s;ome nece&s;&s;ary rules and cautions for &s;hunning tho&s;e dangers.</P>
<P N="5">V. Let them carefully ob&s;erve the variation of the Compa&s;s, with the Currents, and trade-Winds.</P>
<P N="6"><PB REF="15">
VI. Let them u&s;e their utmo&s;t endeavour to un|der&s;tand the Religion, Cu&s;toms, Manners, and Com|modities, with the Inclinations of the Inhabitants, and commit it to writing, that they may give a true acccount of them when they return home.</P>
<P N="7">VII. Let them be curious in ob&s;erving the Clouds; by the clearne&s;s of them whereof, they may know when they draw near to land: for by their pa&s;&s;ing over the land, wanting a &s;upply of Vapours, the Clouds become more white and clear, as <HI>Columbus</HI> ob&s;erved and ex|perienced.</P>
<P N="8">VIII. "When in the day-time they ob&s;erve the Clouds gathering together in heaps near the Hori|zon, looking blew, and a &s;ection appear on that part of the Hemi&s;phere, or by night di&s;cover fire, they may be certain they are approaching to land.</P>
<P N="9">IX. When they come near to the land, let them fir&s;t coa&s;t along by it, and curiou&s;ly ob&s;erve the Creeks and Harbours, their manner of bearing, with their forms or figures.</P>
<P N="10">X. When they have coa&s;ted &s;o long that they are &s;ufficiently &s;atisfied of the figure and &s;ituation of the place, and have found out a convenient River, either broad enough to &s;ecure them from any attempt the Natives may make upon them from &s;hore; or el&s;e who&s;e banks are di&s;tant from Woods or other Am|bu&s;heado's.</P>
<P N="11">XL. When they find an opportunity to venture a|&s;hore, let them go well armed, that they may awe the Natives; who when they &s;ee their &s;tore, or bon|pointed arrows do not pierce them, as they do their own Country-men, will be ready to offer divine ado|ration
<PB REF="16">to them; but let them be very prudent in this ca&s;e; neither ab&s;olutely hindering it, yet mode&s;tly denying &s;uch adoration, by pointing to the heavens, letting them know there they ought to pay their devotion; for by ab&s;olutely hindring their Adoration, they thinking you to be men, will make other attempts upon you, as the <HI>Indians</HI> did upon the <HI>Spaniards</HI> at their fir&s;t coming thither, by holding them &s;o long under water till they were confirmed they were mortal.</P>
<P N="12">XII. Let them be very careful when they are per|mitted to traffick, and live quietly among&s;t the Na|tives, that they &s;hew good examples to them by their good lives and conver&s;ations; let them be ju&s;t in all their dealings, punctual to their promi&s;e, and civil to the Natives in general.</P>
