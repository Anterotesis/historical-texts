<P>THe Forces of the Parliament by Sea have done their utmo&s;t endeavours to maintain the cau&s;e, which by &s;o &s;olemne a Covenant they have profe&s;&s;ed: What my Lord Admirall performed at &s;ea in the reliefe of LYME is already expre&s;&s;ed, and what untill this time he hath done &s;ince the great &s;hip called the JAMES lay at anchor before TORBAY, is &s;ufficiently de|clared by former Pens.

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>ON Sunday was &s;evennight, all the Ships my Lord had with him were &s;ent to plye about <HI>Falmouth,</HI> the place where &s;he imbarqued, and till Sunday la&s;t had no tydings of the Enemies comming forth; when in the morning &s;ome of the Ships in har|bour were &s;eene to &s;et &s;ayle, our Vice-Admirall betooke him&s;elfe to a readine&s;&s;e. The fir&s;t of the Enemies was a Flemmi&s;h man of Warre, who comming within &s;hot the Vice-Admirall gave him twelve Guns in his quarters, but he without any replye, got to wind|ward, and then made out all his
<PB REF="4">&s;ayle, the re&s;t of the Ships being ten in number, followed him, and getting the advantage of the wind, avoided all annoyance from our Ships; three whereof lay &s;o farre off to Sea, as they could not come in to doe &s;ervice, till the Vice-Ad|mirall gave cha&s;e: at la&s;t a nimble Frigot of ours got into play, and m de the Enemy u&s;e their Ord|nance for their owne &s;afety, this interlude of &s;hot continued as long as our Ships could tacke with the Enemies, but they comming out tallowed and traind for &s;o impor|tant a &s;ervice, had a maine advan|tage in flight: however they were cha&s;ed to the very borders of <HI>France,</HI> where they tooke in at <HI>Brest,</HI> and there landed her Maje|&s;tie. Her Maje&s;ty fearing &s;uch a
<PB REF="5">&s;torme, had provided for her &s;ecu|rer e&s;cape (in ca&s;e tho&s;e other ve&s;|&s;els &s;hould have beene wor&s;ted) a Galley of 16 Oares, which the be&s;t ve&s;&s;ell in the world could never have coapt with, &s;o as now we mu&s;t only &s;alve all with patience, yet if my Lord had bin furni&s;hed with other &s;hips, we &s;hould not have doubted but to have given a good account of this bu&s;ine&s;&s;e. No other newes I can for the pre&s;ent acquaint you vvith.</P>
<P>My Lord Admirall hath al&s;o taken a Ship of the King of <HI>Denmarks</HI> of great value, cal'd the Golden <HI>Sun,</HI> carried it into <HI>Port&s;mouth,</HI> where it is to remaine till the Parliaments plea&s;ure be further knowne.</P>
