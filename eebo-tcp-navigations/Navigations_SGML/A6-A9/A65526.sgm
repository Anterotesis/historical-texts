<HEAD>TO THE READER.</HEAD>
<P>_EPi&s;tles like Prologues of Playes, being for the most part past over without Reading; I &s;hall not therefore Enlarge my &s;elf, only to give you an Account, that I have in this work u&s;ed my best Endeavours to be punctually True in the&s;e Collections; The Work it &s;elf would have afforded, matter &s;ufficient for a Large Volume: So many of our Noble Hero's having been Engaged in their Service, and many of them lost their dearest Lives, in that Nations Defence, dying there in the Bed of Honour. Yet am I confident no matter very materiall is here omitted, and therefore free from tho&s;e many Impertinencies with which Large Volumes must needs be stuffed. This may &s;erve to give &s;ufficient In&s;tructions to the Intelligible Reader; like a little Watch &s;hew|ing the time of the day, as well as a great Dyall; and therefore more u&s;efull, becau&s;e le&s;s comber&s;ome. Here ha&s;t thou truly pre&s;ented
<PB REF="3">(and not in a Multiplying Gla&s;s) the great kindne&s;&s;es the <HI>DUTCH</HI> have from time to time received of the <HI>ENGLISH;</HI> And on the o|ther &s;ide, how unthankfull the <HI>DUTCH</HI> have been for them. What my performances have been herein, I &s;hall neither Extenuate nor Ex|toll, leaving every Reader, to judge as he best plea&s;eth; But this let me tell thee, if thou bee&s;t a True <HI>ENGLISH-MAN,</HI> thou can&s;t not but in reading it, very much re&s;cent the Inju|ries and Affronts which the <HI>ENGLISH</HI> have continually received from that Nation. I &s;hall not add hereunto by way of Aggravation, nor reflect upon the Vi&s;itation of the Almighty &s;o hevy now upon them; no le&s;s then add of <HI>1000</HI> dying of the Pe&s;tilence at <HI>AMSTERDAM</HI> in one Week: A True <HI>ENGLISH</HI> Nature, as he hates Ingratitude, &s;o doth he &s;corn to in&s;ult over Men in mi&s;ery. My Prayers therefore &s;hall be, that the Almighty would be plea&s;ed to remove his heavy hand of Vi&s;itation from them, and that they would call to minde the great benefits they have received from the <HI>ENGLISH,</HI> and that Ingratitude is the wor&s;t of Vices.</P>

<HEAD>An Hi&s;tory of the Tran&s;actions be|twixt the Crown of <HI>England,</HI> and the State of the <HI>Netherlands,</HI> &s;ince they fir&s;t began to be a Re|publique. Shewing the great benefits they have received from the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> and their many neglects therein.</HEAD>
<P>_TO begin with the fir&s;t Ri&s;e of the <HI>Netherlandi&s;h</HI> State, who knows not with what Tenderne&s;&s;e, and upon what Terms they were fir&s;t taken into the bo&s;ome of Queen <HI>Elizabeth;</HI> for after the Death of <HI>Charles</HI> King of <HI>Ca&s;tile, Aragon, &amp;c.</HI> and Lord of <HI>Belgium;</HI> a Prince of great Magnanimity and Pui&s;&s;ance: <HI>Philip</HI> the &s;econd his Son &s;ucceeded
<PB N="2" REF="4">him, who tran&s;ported with Ambition, and a Ca|tholick Zeal, (the Reformation of Religion begin|ning then to grow to &s;ome &s;trength in that Coun|try) he re&s;olved to &s;ubject them to his will and plea&s;ure: The&s;e Countries at that time, by the fa|vour of former Princes enjoyed very large Privi|leges and Immunities, of which, for the better Il|lu&s;trating the matter, we &s;hall give you the heads of &s;ome of the chief:
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dr. <HI>Heylins</HI> Microco&s;de of the <HI>Ne|therlands.</HI></NOTE> 1. That the Prince &s;hould place no Stranger among&s;t them with Juri&s;diction over their E&s;tates and Per&s;ons in Offices of War, or Ju&s;tice. 2. The Prince could give nothing to the Clergy: Nor 3. levie any Sub&s;idies without the States of the Country; with &s;everal other Pre|rogatives, too many here to recite. The&s;e large Privileges King <HI>Philip</HI> thought too good for &s;o mean a people as he e&s;teemed them to be, be&s;ides his Zeal to the Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> from which they now were falling; He therefore re&s;olved to reduce them by <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Rhetorick (<HI>viz. the Sword and Cannon</HI>) and to that purpo&s;e &s;ent the Duke of <HI>Alva</HI> with a pu|i&s;&s;ant Army to be his Vice-Roy among&s;t them, gi|ving him Commi&s;sion to place and di&s;place at his plea&s;ure, and to Execute any that he found op|po&s;ite to his de&s;ignes; who having &s;etled him&s;elf in the Government, quickly deprived them of their large Liberties, by taking away all Authority from the ordinary Courts of Ju&s;tice, and Erecting new Con&s;i&s;tories; Several of the Peers he Condemned and put to Death, of which the two chief, were the Counts of <HI>Horn</HI> and <HI>Egmont</HI> whom he beheaded,
<PB N="3" REF="4">Garri&s;ons of <HI>Spaniards</HI> he placed throughout all their Cities and Villages, built up diver&s;e Ca&s;tles, and by Force Exacted of them the twentieth part of the Fruits of the Earth, and the tenth of Mo|vables upon every Alienation: He al&s;o brought in the <HI>Bloody Inqui&s;ition,</HI> and did behave him&s;elf &s;o Tyrannically, that the People were indeed truly mi&s;erable.</P>
<P>Yet &s;ome there were that &s;caped his hands, of which number was the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> and <HI>Count Lodowick</HI> his Brother, who endeavoured what they could in Defence of their Country, though not with &s;uch fortunate Succe&s;&s;e as they expected, for though notwith&s;tanding many Papi&s;ts as well as Prote&s;tants joyned with them (it being a War of <HI>State</HI> and not of <HI>Religion</HI>) yet Duke <HI>Alva</HI> was &s;o Potent, they could not perform much that was con|&s;iderable.</P>
<P>Not long after Duke <HI>Alva</HI> (who&s;e Tyrannies had made him ju&s;tly odious) was called home, and <HI>Don Lewis de Requi&s;ens</HI> was appointed Governour in his &s;tead;

<PB N="4" REF="5">on the behalf of the <HI>Netherlands,</HI> who promi&s;ed fair although it proved but meer di&s;&s;imulation, which &s;he well under&s;tood, though &s;he &s;eemed to take no great notice of it, and therefore to coun|termine him, &s;he underhand cheri&s;hed the <HI>Nether|lands</HI> as much as &s;he could without breach of Peace with <HI>Spain,</HI> and permitted (if not &s;ent) many <HI>Eng|li&s;h</HI> to go over to their aid; among&s;t whom was <HI>John Norris,</HI> &s;econd Son to the Lord <HI>Norris, Henry Cavendi&s;h,</HI> and <HI>Thomas Morgan</HI> Colonels, with &s;eve|rall other Eminent Per&s;ons, who performed many notable &s;ervices to their eternal Honour and Re|nown.</P>
<P>But <HI>Don John,</HI> who&s;e ambition fir&s;t gaped for the Kingdome of <HI>Tune&s;s,</HI> and afterwards for that of <HI>England,</HI> by the Marriage of the Queen of <HI>Scots,</HI> then Heir to the Crown,

This done, they Elected <HI>Francis</HI> Duke of <HI>Anjou,</HI> Heir Apparent to the <HI>French</HI> Crown, and
<PB N="5" REF="5">then in great hopes of Marrying <HI>Elizabeth</HI> Queen of <HI>England,</HI> to be their Lord, who being &s;etled in his Government, and made at <HI>Antwerp</HI> Duke of <HI>Brabant, Limburg,</HI> and <HI>Lorreine,</HI> he pre&s;ently gave free leave for the Exerci&s;e of the Romi&s;h Religion, to as many as would &s;wear fealty to him, and ab|jure the King of <HI>Spains</HI> Authority, intending ra|ther to &s;ettle a Tyranny in him&s;elf, then to drive it from the <HI>Spaniard;</HI> and to this purpo&s;e, to &s;trengthen him&s;elf, he attempts the &s;trong City of <HI>Antwerp,</HI> put his Men into the Town, but it was by the Valour of the <HI>Burgers</HI> &s;hamefully repul&s;ed; the &s;hame of this Ignoble Enterprize, together with &s;ome other di&s;graces, took &s;uch an impre&s;&s;ion upon him, as &s;oon after he died with grief.

<P>During the unfortunate Government of this Duke, the Prince of <HI>Parma</HI> prevailed mightily, being victorious in all places where he came, e&s;pe|cially after the Death of <HI>William</HI> Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> who was treacherou&s;ly &s;lain by a &s;hot of a Pi&s;tol; So that now the State of the <HI>Hollanders</HI> was truly mi&s;erable, having none to Lead them, none to Protect them, and de&s;perate of pardon from their own Prince: Tryal they had made of other Pro|tectors,
<PB N="6" REF="6">but found them to mind their own profit, more then theirs. <HI>England</HI> was now the only San|ctuary they had left to fly unto, to the Queen whereof they humbly &s;ue for Ayd and Protection, proffering her the Soveraignty of their Provinces, and earne&s;tly be&s;eeching her to receive into her Patronage, the poor di&s;tre&s;&s;ed States.

Others were of a countrary opinion, that it was good to Receive and Aid them, lea&s;t the <HI>Spa|niard</HI> fir&s;t conquering them, might with the more ca&s;e annoy <HI>England;</HI> Be&s;ides, it was alleadged the Title that the Queen had to the Soveraignty of tho&s;e Provinces, as being generally de&s;cended from <HI>Edward</HI> the Third, and <HI>Philip</HI> his Wife, who was Si&s;ter, and (as &s;ome report) Heir to <HI>William</HI> Earle of <HI>Hainaull, Holland &amp;c.</HI> Then if <HI>Margaret</HI> from whom the right of <HI>Spain</HI> is derived, were the Daughter of Earle <HI>William,</HI> then was our Queen to &s;ucceed after <HI>Philip</HI> who was rejected: if that <HI>Margaret</HI> were (as many report) his younger Si&s;ter, then was our Queen the undoubted-Heir; her predece&s;&s;ors <HI>Phillippa</HI> being Earle <HI>Williams</HI> Elde&s;t Si&s;ter, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>

<P>The&s;e things the Queen heard with great pati|ence, but refu&s;ed at fir&s;t to take them into prote|ction, much le&s;s to exerci&s;e Soveraignty over them. But having intelligence that the Prince of <HI>Parma</HI> had taken the &s;trong Town of <HI>Antwerp,</HI> and pro|ceeded &s;till on with admirable &s;ucce&s;s: &s;he look|ing with the eyes of pity on the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed State of the&s;e poor <HI>Netherlands,</HI> who were now as it were, expiring, and giving up the Gho&s;t; &s;he at la&s;t conde&s;cended to take them into protection: in doing which, as the King of <HI>Sweden</HI> &s;aid, &s;he did as it were, <HI>take the Crown from her head, and lay it to &s;take on the doubtful chance of War,</HI> the whole World &s;tanding amazed at her valour, that by this Act dur&s;t as it were proclaim open.

<P>Now the conditions of the League betwixt the Queen and the States, were the&s;e, <HI>The Queen &s;hall &s;end to the united Provinces a &s;upply of five thou&s;and Foot and a thou&s;and Hor&s;e under a &s;ufficient General, one of quality and experience, and &s;hall pay them during the War: which money the States when there is a peace &s;hall pay back again: namely, the fir&s;t year of the Peace, the expences of

<P>But before we proceed any further in the&s;e Wars, it will not be ami&s;s to &s;hew the Noble di&s;|po&s;ition and candour of Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> that what &s;he did was not out of ambition, nor avaritious ends, but onely meer pity and commi&s;eration of the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed condition of tho&s;e mi&s;erable people.

<P>Thus we &s;ee through the &s;eries of this di&s;cour&s;e how candidly the Queen of <HI>England,</HI> dealt with the <HI>Netherlanders,</HI> being &s;o far off from &s;elf ends in the bu&s;ine&s;s, that &s;he refu&s;ed all advantages which might in the lea&s;t &s;eem derogatory to her honour. And whereas it is the nature of mo&s;t Princes to make up their own ends upon other Nations mi|&s;eries, &s;he was &s;o contrary from taking advantage of their calamities (although &s;he had a golden opor|tunity put into her hands) that by the aiding of them, &s;he not onely exhau&s;ted her Trea&s;ure, lo&s;t many brave Heroick per&s;ons in their quarrel, but al&s;o engaged the mo&s;t potent Monarch in Chri&s;ten|dome to be her Enemy.

At la&s;t in a third Treaty, <HI>Anno</HI> 1619. there was a full and &s;olemn Compo&s;ition made of all dif|ferences betwixt them, and a fair Order &s;et for their future proceedings.

<P>The <HI>Dutch</HI> exceeded very much in number, and for their defence had built there a very &s;trong For|tre&s;s, with four Points or Bulwarks, and upon each of them Points &s;ix great pieces of Ordnance mounted, mo&s;t of them of Bra&s;s.

<P>A <HI>Japoner</HI> Souldier of the <HI>Dutch,</HI> walking one night upon the Wall of the Ca&s;tle of <HI>Amboyna,</HI> grew &s;o inqui&s;itive as to ask the Centinel (a <HI>Hollan|der</HI>) &s;ome que&s;tions concerning the &s;trength of the Ca&s;tle, and the number of people therein; for which he was apprehended and put to the torture: &s;o dangerous a thing it is to meddle with Edge Tools, or to &s;eek to be wi&s;e in that who&s;e know|ledge may do us hurt. This <HI>Japoner</HI> through the extremity of pain, was brought to confe&s;s that him|&s;elf and &s;undry others of his Country men had con|trived to &s;urprize the Ca&s;tle; which occa&s;ioned divers others of them to be examined and tortured, and at la&s;t drew out a confe&s;sion from them, that the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> were concerned with them therein. Hereupon one <HI>Abel Price</HI> Chirurgeon of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> (who was then a Pri&s;oner in the Ca&s;tle, for offering in his drunkenne&s;s to have &s;et a <HI>Dutch mans</HI> hou&s;e on fire) was by them brought to the torture, which he being not able to endure, &s;oon confe&s;&s;ed what|&s;oever they would have him.

<PB N="18" REF="12">the re&s;t of the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> who lived not in the Ca&s;tle, but under Protection thereof, in a hou&s;e of their own in the Town; who appearing before the Go|vernour, he told them that they were accu&s;ed of a Con&s;piracy to &s;urplize the Ca&s;tle and therefore till further Trial they were to remain Pri&s;oners. Ha|ving thus &s;ecured the men, they &s;end to &s;earch the hou&s;e, where all the Military provi&s;ion they found was onely three Swords, two Hand-guns, and about half a pound of Powder. Great provi&s;ions &s;ure to effect &s;uch things as were laid to their charge!

The manner of which Tor|ture we &s;hall for the rarity thereof deliver it unto you; Fir&s;t they hoi&s;ed them up by the hands with a Cord upon a large Door, making them fa&s;t with two Staples of iron, fixt on both &s;ides at the top of the Door po&s;ts, &s;o halling their hands one from
<PB N="19" REF="12">the other as wide as ever they could make them to &s;tretch: having thus fa&s;tned their hands, and their body hoi&s;ed &s;ome two Foot from the ground, then they &s;tretcht their legs a&s;under as far as they would reach, which they likewi&s;e made fa&s;t beneath unto the Door po&s;ts, on each &s;ide. Next they bound a cloth about their neck and face, &s;o clo&s;e as that little or no water could go by: this done, they poured the water &s;oftly upon their heads till the cloth was full up to the mouth and no&s;trils, or &s;omewhat higher; in&s;omuch that in drawing their breath they mu&s;t of nece&s;sity &s;uck in the water, which with long continuance, forced all their inward parts, coming out of their no&s;e, ears, and eyes, &s;o &s;tifling and choaking them, that at la&s;t it took a|way their breath, and brought them into a &s;wou|ning condition; then would they take them down and make them vomit up their water again, and being a little recovered, hoice them up again, and &s;erve them as before. Thus would they handle them three or four &s;everal times together, till their bodies would be &s;wollen &s;ometimes twice or thrice as big as before, their Cheeks &s;hewing like to great blown bladders, and their Eyes &s;taring and &s;truting out beyond their foreheads. And now if they would not confe&s;s what&s;oever they would have them to do, then would they torment them by a contrary Element, &s;etting burning Candles to the bottomes of their feet while&s;t they were thus hanging, continuing &s;o till many times the fat dropt out the Candles, and they were forced to ap|ply
<PB N="20" REF="13">fre&s;h lights. They would al&s;o burn them un|der the elbows, in the palms of their hands, and un|der their arm-pits, till their very inwards might evidently be &s;een.

<LETTER LANG="eng">
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>BY your Letters and otherwi&s;e, I perceive ma|ny jealou&s;ies and di&s;cour&s;es are rai&s;ed upon the preparations of his Maje&s;ties Fleet,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">J. Selden.</NOTE> which is now in &s;uch forwardne&s;s, that we doubt not but within this Month it will appear at Sea. It is there|fore expedient both for your Satisfaction and Di|rection, to Inform you particularly what was the
<PB N="32" REF="19">occa&s;ion, and what is his Maje&s;ties intention in this work.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, we hold it a Principle not to be denyed, that the King of Great <HI>Brittain</HI> is a Monarch at Land and Sea, to the full extent of his Dominions, and that it concerneth him as much to maintain his Soveraignty in all the <HI>Britti&s;h</HI> Seas, as within his Three Kingdomes; Becau&s;e, without that, the&s;e cannot be kept &s;afe; nor he pre&s;erve his Honour and due Re&s;pect with other Nations. But Com|manding the Seas, he may cau&s;e his Neighbours, and all Countries to &s;tand upon their Guard when|&s;oever he thinks fit. And this cannot be doubted, that who&s;oever will Encroach upon him by Sea, will do it by Land al&s;o, when they &s;ee their time. To &s;uch pre&s;umption <HI>Mare Liberum</HI> gave the fir&s;t Warning-piece, which mu&s;t be An&s;wered with a defence of <HI>Mare Clau&s;um,</HI> not &s;o much by Di&s;|cour&s;es, as by the louder Language of a Powerfull Navy, to be better under&s;tood, when over-&s;trained patience &s;eeth no hope of pre&s;erving her Right by other means.</P>
<P>The Degrees, by which his Maje&s;ties Dominion at Sea hath of late Years been fir&s;t impeached, and then que&s;tioned, are as con&s;iderable as notorious.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> to cheri&s;h, and as it were, to nur&s;e up our unthankfull Neighbours, we gave them leave to gather wealth and &s;trength upon our Coa&s;ts, in our Ports, by our Trade, and by our People. Then they were glad to invite our Merchants Re&s;idence with what Privileges they would de&s;ire. Then
<PB N="33" REF="19">they offered to us the Soveraignty of their E&s;tates, and then they &s;ued for Licen&s;e to Fi&s;h upon the Coa&s;ts, and obtained it under the great Seal of <HI>Scot|land,</HI> which now they &s;uppre&s;s. And when thus by leave, or by connivance, they had po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed them&s;elves of our Fi&s;hings, and onely in <HI>Scotland,</HI> but in <HI>Ireland</HI> and <HI>England,</HI> not by our Staple had rai&s;ed a great &s;tock of Trade; by the&s;e means they &s;o encreas'd their Shipping and Power at Sea, that now they endure not to be kept at any di&s;tance: Nay, they are grown to that confidence to keep Guards upon our Seas, and then to project an office and Company of A&s;&s;urance for the Advancement of Trade; and withall, prohibet us free Commerce even within our own Seas, and take our Ships and Goods, if we conform not to their Placarts. What In&s;olencies and Cruelties they have committed a|gain&s;t us heretofore, in <HI>Ireland,</HI> in <HI>Greenland,</HI> and in the <HI>Indies,</HI> is too well known to all the World. In all which, though our &s;ufferings and their wrong may &s;eem forgotten, yet the greate&s;t intere&s;t of his Maje&s;ties Honour, is &s;till the &s;ame, and will re|fre&s;h their memories as there &s;hall be cau&s;e: For, though charity mu&s;t reunite wrongs done to private men, yet the reflection upon the Publique, may make it a greater charity to do Ju&s;tice on crying crimes. All this notwith&s;tanding, you are not to conceive that the work of this Fleet, is either re|venge, or execution of Ju&s;tice for the&s;e great Of|fences pa&s;t; but chiefly, for the future to &s;top the violent current of that pre&s;umption whereby the
<PB N="34" REF="20">Men of War, and Free-booters of all Nations (a|bu&s;ing the Favour of his Maje&s;ties Peaceable and Gracious Government, whereby he hath permit|ted all his Friends and Allies, to make u&s;e of his Seas and Ports in a rea&s;onable and free manner, and according to his Treaties) have taken upon them the boldne&s;s, not onely to come confidently at all times into all his Ports and Rivers, but to conveigh their Merchants Ships as high as his Chief City, and then to ca&s;t Anchor clo&s;e upon his Magazins, and to contemn the Commands of his Officers, when they required a further di&s;tance: But which is more intollerable, have A&s;&s;aulted and Taken one another within his Maje&s;ties Chamber, and within his Rivers, to the &s;ame &s;corn and contempt of his Dominion and Power; and this being of late years an ordinary practice which we have endeavoured in vain to reform by the waies of Ju&s;tice and Trea|ties, the World I think will now be &s;atisfied, that we have rea&s;on to look about us. And no wi&s;e man will doubt that it is high time to put our &s;elves in this Equipage upon the Seas, and not to &s;uffer that Stage of action to be taken from us for want of our appearance.</P>
<P>So you &s;ee the general ground upon which our Coun&s;els &s;tand; In particular, you may take no|tice, and publi&s;h as cau&s;e requires; That his Ma|je&s;ty by this Fleet intendeth not a Rupture with any Prince or State, nor to infringe any point of his Treaties; but re&s;olveth to continue and maintain that Happy Peace wherewith God hath ble&s;&s;ed his
<PB N="35" REF="20">Kingdome; and to which all his Actions and Ne|gotiations have hither tended, as by your own In|&s;tructions you may fully under&s;tand. But withall con&s;idering, that Peace mu&s;t be maintained by the Arm of Power, which onely keeps down War, by keeping up Dominion, his Maje&s;ty thus provoked, finds it nece&s;&s;ary even for his own Defence and Safety, to Re-a&s;&s;ume and keep his Antient and Un|doubted Right in the Dominion of the&s;e Seas, and to &s;uffer no other Prince or State to Encroach upon Him, thereby a&s;&s;uming to Them&s;elves or their Admiralls, any Soveraign Command; but to force them to perform due homage to his Admiralls and Ships, and to pay them acknowledgements, as in former times they did. He will al&s;o &s;et open, and protect the Free Trade both of his Subjects and Allies: And give them &s;uch &s;afe Conduct and Convoy, as they &s;hall rea&s;onably require. He will &s;uffer no other Fleets or Men of War, to keep any Guard upon tho&s;e Seas, or there to offer Violence, or take Prizes, or Booties, or to give Interruption to any lawfull intercour&s;e. In a word, his Maje&s;ty is re&s;olved, as to do no Wrong, &s;o to do Ju&s;tice both to his Subjects and Friends, within the limmits of his Seas. And this is the Real and Royal de&s;ign of this Fleet, whereof you may give part as you find occa&s;ion to our good Neighbours in tho&s;e parts, that no umbrage may be taken of any Ho&s;tile act or purpo&s;e to their prejudice in any kind: So wi&s;h|ing you all health and happine&s;s, I Re&s;t</P>

</LETTER>
<PB N="36" REF="21">
<P>In this Letter you &s;ee fir&s;t, how it was held for an undeniable Principle, that the King was King as well by Sea as by Land; That neither the Honour nor Safety of this I&s;land and <HI>Ireland</HI> could be main|tained, but by pre&s;erving the Dominion by Sea; and that it is an Argument, that they that Encroach upon us by Sea, will do it al&s;o by Land when they &s;ee their time. He declares al&s;o, how our un|thankfull Neighbours are ri&s;en, to this height and in&s;olence, partly by grant, partly by connivance, but principally through their many injurious abu&s;es of our Patience and Indulgence. And la&s;tly, you may ob&s;erve here what Re&s;olutions were then ta|ken to prevent the like injuries, and pre&s;erve our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Intere&s;t in time to come; And no doubt, but that Prudent Prince would with his Navall Forces have brought down their in&s;olency, had his Subjects been as forward to have &s;upplyed Him in that nece&s;&s;ary occa&s;ion, as they were afterwards to contribute to His Enemies again&s;t Him.</P>
<P>Yet notwith&s;tanding all hinderances, <HI>Anno</HI> 1635. The King &s;et out a Gallant Fleet of Three&s;core Saile,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sir R. Baker</NOTE> whereof the Earle of <HI>Lind&s;ey</HI> was Admirall, and the Earle of <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI> Vice-Admiral; who &s;cow|red the Seas from Pirats formerly mole&s;ting, where|by our Commodities were &s;afely tran&s;ported, and the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Pui&s;&s;ance rendred &s;o con&s;iderable in the eyes of Forreign Princes, that the King of <HI>Spain</HI> judged it his &s;ure&s;t way to entru&s;t his Bullion in our bottomes, which was Coyned in <HI>England,</HI> to the un|&s;peakable
<PB N="37" REF="21">benefit of the Kings Mint, as al&s;o to the Merchants, who&s;e Commocities were exchanged thereby, the remainder of the Money being paid at <HI>Flanders</HI> by way of Exchange. At this time the <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Hollanders</HI> had confederated together to infe&s;t the <HI>Spaniard</HI> in <HI>Flanders,</HI> the one by Land, and the other by Sea; But the <HI>Hollanders</HI> are remo|ved from before <HI>Dunkirk</HI> by the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Fleet, and the Natives di&s;contented by the in&s;olencies of the <HI>French;</HI> ro&s;e up in Armes again&s;t them, and joyn|ing with the <HI>Spaniard,</HI> expelled them out of the Country.</P>
<P>The good &s;ucce&s;&s;e of this Fleet, Encouraged the King next Year to &s;end another, con&s;i&s;ting of the like number, under the Command of the Earle of <HI>Northumberland;</HI> who Sailing Northwards, &s;cow|red the Seas of the <HI>Dutch</HI> Bu&s;&s;es, &s;eizing &s;ome, &s;ink|ing others, and making the re&s;t to fly; reducing them thereby to a precarious condition of entreat|ing the favour of Fi&s;hing by the Kings Commi&s;|&s;ion, and no doubt had not the di&s;po&s;ition of his Affairs hindred him, he would have &s;ufficiently re|&s;trained them from Encroaching upon his Rights in the Britti&s;h Seas.</P>
<P>But the Aver&s;ne&s;s of his Subjects to any comply|ance of Charge, was to him a great di&s;advantage, as on the other &s;ide, of great advantage to the <HI>Hol|landers,</HI> who now were grown &s;o pre&s;umptious as to &s;et upon the <HI>Spaniards</HI> in the <HI>Britti&s;h</HI> Seas, which (as being both Friends to <HI>England</HI>) ought by Rule of State to have been an Harbour of Retreat to &s;ecure

<P>The beaten <HI>Spaniard,</HI> being now got as they thought under the Lee of <HI>Englands</HI> Protection, be|gun to divi&s;e how to get rid of their bad Neigh|bours; and by their Re&s;ident importuned the King to Protect them from the <HI>Hollander</HI> for two Tides, that they might have convenience to get back again to <HI>Spain;</HI> But King <HI>Charles</HI> being in Amity with them both, would not meddle in the bu&s;ine&s;s, but was re&s;olved to &s;tand Neuter; And whereas the <HI>Spaniards</HI> had hired &s;ome <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Ships to Tran&s;port their Souldiers to <HI>Dunkirk,</HI> the King under&s;tanding thereof, upon complaint of the <HI>Dutch</HI> Amba&s;&s;ador, he forthwith gave &s;trict Order, that none &s;hould take in any <HI>Spaniards,</HI> nor pre&s;ume to pa&s;&s;e beyond <HI>Grave&s;end</HI> without Licen&s;e: So both &s;ides being let to them&s;elves, Plotted a great while counter the one to the other; but the wily <HI>Spaniard</HI> at length &s;omewhat out-witted his Enemy, and by a &s;tra|tagem in the Night conveyed away to <HI>Dunkirk</HI> Fourteen Ships, and in them Four Thou&s;and Men, and Four Hundred Thou&s;and Pounds in Silver.

<P>For on the 11th of the &s;ame Month, <HI>Van Trump</HI> the <HI>Dutch</HI> Admirall, gave Command to his Fleet to fall on them, which they did with Cannon and Fire&s;hips in &s;o furious a manner, as they unable to endure their &s;hot, cut their Cables, and being Fifty Three in number, Twenty Three of them run on Shore, and &s;tranded in the <HI>Downs,</HI> whereof three were burnt, two &s;unk, and two peri&s;hed on the Shore; one of which was a great Gallion of Two and Fifty Bra&s;s Pieces of Ordnance, Commanded by the Vice Admiral of <HI>Gallizia, Don Andrew de Ca&s;tro;</HI> the remainder of the Twenty Three were de&s;erted by the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> who went to Land, lea|ving their Ships to be Man'd by the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> for &s;afe|guards from the <HI>Dutch.</HI> The other Thirty <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Ships under the Command of the Admiralls <HI>Don Antonio d'oquenda,</HI> and <HI>Lopus</HI> of <HI>Portugal,</HI> went to Sea, keeping in clo&s;e order, till they were covered with a great Fogg, whereof the <HI>Dutch</HI> taking ad|vantage, interpo&s;ed between the Admiralls and their Fleet and Fought them valiantly till the fogg cleared up, when the Admirall of <HI>Portugal</HI> began to flame, being Fired with two <HI>Holland</HI> Fire-&s;hips, which <HI>D'oquenda</HI> perceiving, he pre&s;ently took his cour&s;e towards <HI>Dunkirk,</HI> with the poor remainder of his Ships, the mo&s;t of the re&s;t being lo&s;t and ta|ken; for of the&s;e Thirty, Eleven were &s;ent Pri&s;o|ners into <HI>Holland,</HI> Three peri&s;hed upon the Coa&s;t

<P>This daring of the <HI>Dutch,</HI> to Fight thus on the Coa&s;t of <HI>England,</HI> was looked upon as an high affront to our King, and the <HI>Hollanders</HI> doubting that he would ill re&s;ent it, were willing to keep him &s;o bu&s;ied, that he &s;hould not have opportunity to re|venge, and to that end, Commotions beginning to ari&s;e in <HI>Scotland,</HI> the <HI>Hollanders</HI> did not only un|derhand Foment them, but al&s;o Accommodated them with all manner of Warlike Provi&s;ion.</P>

<P>Not long after happened the death of <HI>William</HI> Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> brother-in-law to our now gra|cious Soveraign, a Prince who&s;e Ance&s;tors had ve|ry well de&s;erved of the <HI>Netherlandi&s;h</HI> State, though now former &s;ervices began to be &s;lighted, as when the Storm is one pa&s;t, the danger is &s;oon forgotten.

<P>And now our Mu&s;hrome Common-wealths|men, though active enough for all mi&s;chief what|&s;oever, yet began to look with an envious eye up|on the <HI>Dutch</HI> mens engro&s;&s;ing almo&s;t the whole Sea Trade to them&s;elves, and therefore they framed an Act <HI>for the increa&s;e of Shipping, and the encou|ragement

<P>This Action the States of <HI>Holland</HI> would not in any wi&s;e &s;eem to own or countenance, and there|fore to excu&s;e the matter, as done without their con&s;ent, they di&s;patched their Amba&s;&s;adours into <HI>England,</HI> to renew the Treaty with the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Common-wealth, who though of the latter &s;tand|ing, yet would be accounted Superiour to the other. Yet notwith&s;tanding the&s;e Overtures of Peace, the Treaty ended in an ab&s;olute breach: &s;o that open War was denounced and publickly pro|clamed on both &s;ides.</P>

<P>Soon after happened another Encounter near <HI>Plymouth,</HI> between Sir <HI>George</HI> and the <HI>Dutch</HI> Fleet, con&s;i&s;ting of 60 Men of War, and 30 Merchants, part of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Fleet coming up to Sir <HI>George Ay&s;coughs</HI> a&s;&s;i&s;tance. This Engagement continued very fierce till night parted them, not without &s;ome lo&s;s to the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> but much more to the <HI>Dutch.</HI> The&s;e &s;ucce&s;&s;es were &s;econded by others very remarkable.

<P>Soon after (&s;o great and deadly was their fewd) they were engaged again by General <HI>Blake</HI> on the back-&s;ide of <HI>Goodwin</HI> Sands, wherein the <HI>Dutch</HI> were lamentably defeated, which Bout was called the <HI>Kenti&s;h Knock.</HI> But in the <HI>Levant</HI> Seas, a &s;mall Fleet of the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> conveying certain Merchants men from <HI>Scanderoon,</HI> were &s;et upon by 11
<PB N="45" REF="25"><HI>Dutch</HI> Men of War; who over-powering them in number, took the <HI>Phoenix</HI> Friggot, and much dammaged the other.

<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sir R.

<P>But one of the &s;harpe&s;t fights of all was near the <HI>I&s;le of Wight,</HI> and <HI>Portland,</HI> wherein the <HI>Dutch</HI> recei|ved a great overthrow, 50 Merchants being taken 9 Men of War, above 2000 &s;lain, and 1500 ta|ken Pri&s;oners.</P>
<P>All the&s;e fights happened during the time the Long-Parliament (or rather the Rump or Fag end of them) ruled the Roa&s;t; but they having &s;ate brooding a long time, and brought forth nothing but addle Eggs, <HI>Oliver Cromwel</HI> put them be&s;ides the Saddle, but not with an intent to ea&s;e the <HI>Eng|li&s;h</HI> Nation of their Tyranny, but onely to &s;ettle it in him&s;elf: and thereupon <HI>(Heavens protect us!)</HI> he was made Protector of <HI>England, Scotland,</HI> and <HI>Ireland,</HI> becau&s;e the Common-wealth being in its Infancy needed a Guardian. The&s;e Dome&s;tick Revolutions put new life into the <HI>Dutch,</HI> who well hoped from the&s;e di&s;tractions to gain a Victory o|ver the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> and therefore with great confi|dence
<PB N="46" REF="26">put forth again to Sea, thinking: upon no|thing &s;o much as Chap-men for the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Fleet; &s;aying,
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Englands</HI> Worthies.</NOTE> <HI>It was to be cryed out by the &s;ound of Trumpets and Horns.</HI> But tho&s;e who reckon without their Ho&s;t, we &s;ay, mu&s;t reckon twice; and the <HI>Dutch</HI> were deceived in their expectations; for coming to a fight on the North Fore-land, near unto the South Point of the <HI>Gober,</HI> (notwith&s;tanding the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> lo&s;t General <HI>Dean,</HI> one of their Admirals, who was &s;lain by a great &s;hot) yet received they a great overthrow, eleven Men of War, and two Water Hoys being taken, be&s;ides &s;ix Captains, &s;if|teen hundred Pri&s;oners, and &s;ix Men of War, which were &s;unke.</P>
<P>Certainly this War with the <HI>Dutch</HI> which had been driven on with &s;o great &s;ucce&s;s, might have been ended with as great advantages, by the Rump Parliament; and therefore <HI>Cromwel</HI> being &s;carce warm in his new &s;eat, entertained their fir&s;t Mo|tion of a Treaty, to which purpo&s;e they had &s;ent Commi&s;&s;ioners over into <HI>England.</HI> But whiles this was in doing, the <HI>Dutch</HI> (as it is thought) think|ing to have taken our Navy napping, there hap|pened a cruel fight betwixt them, the greate&s;t du|ring all this War; wherein the <HI>Dutch</HI> whole Fleet was put to flight, about thirty Men of War &s;unk and fired, &s;ix Captains, and about a thou&s;and Men taken Pri&s;oners, and about &s;ix thou&s;and &s;lain, among&s;t whom (which added not a little to the greatne&s;s of the Victory) was their Admiral <HI>Van Trump,</HI> an expert Sea-man and good Souldier, and

<P>That their Lord&s;hips were informed, that Captain <HI>Holmes</HI> with the Ships under his Command, had taken divers of their Ve&s;&s;els upon the Coa&s;t of <HI>Affrick,</HI> and al&s;o made him|&s;elf Ma&s;ter of <HI>Capo Verde,</HI> and &s;ome other Forts belonging

<P>And la&s;tly, con&s;idering that tho&s;e Ve&s;&s;els which come from the United Provinces into the &s;everal Streams of this Kingdome, are there &s;topped under pretence of Per&s;ons and Commodities on board, which come from places infected with the Plague, or &s;u&s;pected &s;o to be, to the ob&s;truction of Trade, and prejudice of both Nations; The &s;aid Amba&s;&s;a|dour therefore in&s;i&s;ted, that the &s;ame might be remedied, or at lea&s;t the &s;trictne&s;s of tho&s;e orders mittigated in &s;uch mea|&s;ure as &s;hould by rea&s;on be found convenient, &s;ince by the mercy of God, all the Provinces in general, were not in|fected with the Contagion.</P>
<P><HI>His Majesties An&s;wer was to this Effect.</HI></P>
<P>That concerning the Preparations and Provi&s;sions of Ve&s;&s;els of War, it was well known, there was order given in the beginning of the Year, for providing a le&s;s Guard of Ships for this Summer, then any Year &s;ince his Happy Re|&s;tauration, believing he might well &s;ave that charge, being in &s;o good Intelligence with all his Neighbours.

<PB N="52" REF="29">Sea, in other places, as well as in the <HI>East-Indies,</HI> wherein were &s;ome circum&s;tances of that pre&s;umption, by declaring their Dominion, and inhibiting Commerce again&s;t the Law of Nations: To whom his Maje&s;ty made no other An&s;wer, but that he doubted not the States of the United Provinces would cau&s;e Ju&s;tice to be done, and to that end, appointed his Mini&s;ter to make a repre&s;entation and complaint, for which (con&s;idering the nature of the Offences) he expected thanks for them, but contrarily they gave order for the pre&s;ent &s;etting out of a very great Number of Ships of War, no other vi&s;ible cau&s;e being manife&s;t, then to declare to the world how they defied both him and his Parliament: So that it would have been very little to his Honour or Intere&s;t, if he likewi&s;e had not prepared a con&s;iderable Fleet for his De|fence, and being thus prepared, it would be a very &s;trange propo&s;ition to be kept &s;till within the Ports, and that it would be found by their demeanour, that their in&s;tructions were not to injure our Friends, but to defend him and his Subjects from receiving injuries of Enemies.</P>
<P>As therefore he had with an everla&s;ting manife&s;tation of his Affection and Kindne&s;s to the United Provinces, concluded the late Treaty, by which many memorable injuries to him and his people, (particularly that of <HI>Amboyna</HI>) were put in Oblivion; So he had for his part exactly ob&s;erved every Ar|ticle, and had no &s;ooner been moved in any particular wherein the Subjects of the United Provinces were grieved, but that &s;peedy order was given for their redre&s;s, without putting them to tho&s;e formalities which are u&s;ual in Courts of Ju&s;tice; whereas contrarily, when his Mini&s;ter had made complaints at the <HI>Hague,</HI> notwith&s;tanding the matter of Fact were mo&s;t notorious, yet was not redre&s;s given to any one, and &s;uch delayes u&s;ed in all, as was upon the matter a plaine denyal of Ju&s;tice, which cau&s;ed great complaints from his Subjects every day; Yet for all this, he had not granted one Letter of Mart upon the Subjects of that State.</P>
<PB N="53" REF="29">
<P>That concerning Captain <HI>Holmes,</HI> he had no Commi&s;sion to take <HI>Capo Verde,</HI> or any other place belonging to the <HI>Dutch,</HI> or to act any ho&s;tility again&s;t them, but what was for the de|fence of his Subjects, and their Trade in tho&s;e Parts; and therefore expected his Declaration &s;hould have found more credit with them then informations of Seamen, who &s;eldom know what they informe: That upon Captain <HI>Holmes</HI> Ar|rival, who was expected every day; a due enquiry &s;hould be made, and a ju&s;t determination done; That the Ships de&s;ign|ed for tho&s;e Parts at pre&s;ent, had neither Power nor Will to wrong the Subjects of that State. But on the contrary, his Maje&s;ty was &s;orry to hear, not from general Rumour, but pregnant Evidence of his Governour of the Fort of <HI>Corman|tine,</HI> that about the end of la&s;t <HI>January,</HI> the Commanders of the Ships belonging to the <HI>Dutch VVe&s;t-India</HI> Company, after divers A&s;&s;aults and Re&s;traints of his Merchant Ships in tho&s;e Seas, they hired the King of <HI>Fantine</HI> to A&s;&s;ault and Surprize his Ca&s;tle of <HI>Cormantine,</HI> and to deliver it to them for the price of Sixty <HI>Bendys,</HI> whereof one half was by them paid down, with further condition that the Natives &s;hould enjoy the Plunder of the Ca&s;tle; To perform which, the &s;aid <HI>Dutch</HI> Commanders &s;upplyed the King of <HI>Fantine</HI> with a great quantity of Mu&s;quets, Powder and Cartages; whereof his Commander having notice, by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of God &s;urpri|zed the &s;ame, which perhaps was one of tho&s;e Acts of Ho&s;ti|lity mentioned in the Memorial, no Intelligence coming of any other. Two <HI>Dutch</HI> Men of War came from the <HI>Mina</HI> to <HI>Cape</HI> Coa&s;t to attend this Enterprize at the appointed time; and accordingly, the King of <HI>Fantine, Feb.</HI> 5. came with 500 Men to have &s;urprized the Ca&s;tle, but finding him&s;elf di&s;covered, was forced to retire with &s;ome lo&s;s; the next day he advanced again with a Body of 3000 Men, continu|ing a &s;harp Fight with the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> for the &s;pace of four hours, but was beat off with great lo&s;s, &s;ince which he ac|knowledged the motives and contract afore&s;aid; The <HI>Dutch</HI> Ships at the &s;ame time driving a &s;mall <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Ship under the
<PB N="54" REF="30">Command of Captain <HI>Borthwick</HI> into his Maje&s;ties Port of <HI>Ina&s;hange,</HI> Anchored by him, hindred all the Cances from coming on board him, and took his Boat and five Men, which they would not re&s;tore, till they had knowledge their other enterprize was mi&s;carried. This his Maje&s;ty doubted not, they would in manife&s;tation of this perfideous de&s;igne cau&s;e Exemplary Ju&s;tice to be inflicted on the per&s;ons guilty of it; and in&s;tead of &s;ending Ships of War to ju&s;tifie tho&s;e proceedings (which might produce a War betwixt the Two Nations) would warn their <HI>VVe&s;t-India</HI> Company hereafter to forbear &s;uch Out-rages, and not to pre&s;ume under the &s;tile of Merchants to U&s;urp the Prerogative of Princes, and A&s;&s;ume &s;uch a Dominion to them&s;elves, which if they were Inve&s;ted with, would not warrant them to inhabit Traffique and Commerce with their Neighbours, but mu&s;t incen&s;e all Chri&s;tian Princes again&s;t their Pre&s;umption.</P>
<P>That his Maje&s;ty was greatly Afflicted for the Vi&s;itation of God upon them, by which means the Commerce of both Nations was &s;u&s;pended; but that it could not be expected he &s;hould decline from that provident care of his People, in u&s;ing all po&s;sible means to pre&s;erve them from that conta|gion, which without &s;uch re&s;traints could not be; and ho|ped the goodne&s;s of God would &s;hortly put a period to it, and make the Corre&s;pondence as &s;afe and whole&s;ome as it had been.</P>
<P>That He de&s;ired their Amba&s;&s;adour to a&s;&s;ure them, that he was firmly re&s;olved to maintain a firm Amity &amp; Friend|&s;hip with them, that (by the Ble&s;sing of God) a War could not fall out betwixt them, unle&s;s they departed from all Rules of Ju&s;tice, and &s;uffered their Subjects to involve them in a War, to &s;upport the wrong they did their Neighbours again&s;t all right, which he hoped their great Wi&s;edomes would prevent.</P>
<P>By this which hath been &s;aid, the Reader may ea&s;ily con|jecture how the Affairs &s;tand at pre&s;ent betwixt the two Na|tions, and with what prudence and &s;incerity his Maje&s;ties
<PB N="55" REF="30">proceedings hath been towards them. I &s;hall not in&s;i&s;t to amplifie any further therein; Onely now at la&s;t, as a Coral|lary to the whole, con&s;idering the chief Affairs of <HI>Holland</HI> have their dependence upon the Princes of <HI>Orange:</HI> I &s;hall give you a Brief Account and Character of them, from their fir&s;t inve&s;titure into that Principality, unto this pre&s;ent time.</P>
<P><HI>Anno</HI> 1475. King <HI>Lewis</HI> of <HI>France</HI> inve&s;ted <HI>Lewis</HI> of <HI>Cha|bon</HI> with the Principality of <HI>Orange;</HI> who dying, left his E&s;tate and Government to his Heroick, Active, Succe&s;&s;ive <HI>William,</HI> who&s;e Magnificent Prowe&s;s was &s;o Con&s;iderable, that <HI>Lewis</HI> the 11 de&s;ired his Alliance, and gave him his own Cou&s;in in Marriage, E&s;teeming him for a mo&s;t Mag|nanimous Per&s;on all the dayes of his life.</P>
<P>His Honour and E&s;tate being much Improved, he be|queathed the &s;ame to <HI>John Chabon,</HI> a Prince of admirable Valour, who&s;e Pui&s;&s;ance <HI>France</HI> dreaded, and whom the Duke of <HI>Burgundy</HI> found a Loving Friend, in who&s;e Service he died, <HI>Anno</HI> 1496.</P>
<P><HI>Philibert Chabon</HI> his Nephew, was Heir to his E&s;tate and Authority; a Gallant Souldier, and of a Noble Re&s;olution, who continued a True and Con&s;tant Servant to the Hou&s;e of <HI>Au&s;tria,</HI> who dying without I&s;&s;ue, the Honour of <HI>Na&s;&s;aw</HI> was interwoven with the Magnificent Glory of the Hou&s;e of <HI>Orange; Philiberts</HI> Si&s;ter being Married to <HI>Rene Na&s;&s;aw,</HI> who&s;e Son <HI>Henry</HI> is by <HI>Philibert</HI> Adopted for his Heir, 1500.</P>
<P>This <HI>Henry</HI> as he was Heir to his E&s;tate, &s;o was he to his Virtues, being bred a Souldier from his Cradle, his Blood Ennobling his Name and his Actions his Blood. He per|formed many Gallant &s;ervices for the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> and died before <HI>Luxemburght;</HI> being &s;aid to have left &s;ix things behind him of great Con&s;equence to <HI>Spain</HI> and <HI>Flanders:</HI> 1. How to Entrench and Fortifie double. 2. How to re|treat &s;afely. 3. How to Embattle the Foot four deep &s;e|curely. 4. How to bear a charge, and return it home un|dauntedly. 5. How to tire an Army with often &s;urprizals,
<PB N="56" REF="31">And 6. How to conquer with kindne&s;s. He died, <HI>Anno.</HI> 1544.</P>
<P>To whom by his Will and the Peoples Vote Succeeded his Cou&s;in <HI>William,</HI> a Martiall Prince, and who was bred up in the School of <HI>Mars,</HI> under Count <HI>Mansfield,</HI> in the Wars of <HI>Germany;</HI> a Per&s;on very Honourable in his Po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion in <HI>France,</HI> Noble in <HI>Germany,</HI> and Rich in the <HI>Low-Countries,</HI> a Popular Prince, Wi&s;e, Wary, Eloquent of Speech, and Grave in Councel, and of a Plau&s;ible Carriage and Behaviour, of whom it was que&s;tionable whether he were more able in comprehending bu&s;ine&s;s, or more wary in meanaging it. Under this Prince the <HI>Netherlanders</HI> threw off their &s;ubjection to the Crown of <HI>Spain,</HI> as we declared to you in the beginning of the Hi&s;tory; He was at la&s;t ba&s;ely Murthered by one <HI>Balthazar Gerard,</HI> being &s;hot to Death as he came from Dinner; a mo&s;t Wi&s;e, Con&s;tant, Magnanimious Prince, his Motto being, <HI>Mediis tranquillus inundis,</HI> &mdash;</P>
<P>Prince <HI>Maurice</HI> being of the age of 17 years, &s;ucceeded him in his Honours and E&s;tate, he brought the <HI>Spaniards</HI> to a Peace, the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> to a League, and his own People to a Peaceable &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to his Government; and &s;o died in the bed of Honour.</P>
<P>Count <HI>Henry</HI> of <HI>Na&s;&s;aw</HI> &s;ucceeded him, a Great States-Man, but in the mid&s;t of his de&s;ignes he dyed, leaving his Honours and E&s;tate to his Son Prince <HI>William,</HI> that Married the Lady <HI>Mary,</HI> Daughter to our late Martyred Soveraign King <HI>Charles,</HI> who dying in the Prime of his years, left his Honours and Title to his Son <HI>William,</HI> who is now living, a mo&s;t hopefull Prince, whom <HI>Holland</HI> is jealous of, and hath been uncivill to, con&s;idering his Great Ance&s;tours Merrit and Service, though we make no doubt, but he will attain by his De&s;erts, to no le&s;s Power and Grandeur, then any of his Renowned Predece&s;&s;ours.</P>
