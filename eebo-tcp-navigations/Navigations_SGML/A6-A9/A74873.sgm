<HEAD>A PAPER Delivered by the LORDS EMBASSADORS To the Councel of State.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Most Honourable Lords,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_WE are here by rea&s;on of an unhappy and unexpected mi&s;|chance; An horrible report hath amazed us, that a fight at &s;ea &s;hould have been betwixt the Fleet of this Com|mon-wealth and of the united Provinces, and that ours &s;hould have been the rea&s;on of this unfortunate bu&s;i|ne&s;&s;e, That we began the fight, and that thereupon is fought mo&s;t cruelly; and that from thence the rumor of the breaking off the treaty,
<PB N="4" REF="3">and of open war (which &s;hould be very near at hand between the two Nations) was &s;pread: We a&s;toni&s;hed by this &s;ad report, direct our &s;elves to this honourable A&s;&s;embly and do Declare before God, and out of all our Hearts, that the Fact, &s;o as it is reported, is committed without the knowledge, and again&s;t the will of the States of the united Provinces our Lords, and of us their Emba&s;&s;adours. Moreover, we do affirm, That the hearts of ours do de&s;ire nothing but Unity, Peace, League, and a very near friend&s;hip with this Common-wealth, and hope that withall their wi&s;hes. In the mean while, we do think it not to be ami&s;&s;e, if we give notice unto your honours, that we have re|ceived letters from the Admiral of the Fleet of the United Provinces Dated the 30 of the la&s;t moneth, wherein the occa&s;ion and rea&s;on of the &s;aid Fight quite otherwi&s;e is declared then the common Report is; for the truth of which bu&s;ine&s;&s;e, we &s;uppo&s;e to be convenient to inquire exactly; but this is worth ob&s;ervation in the mean time, That our Ad|miral <HI>Trump</HI> in the &s;ame letter doth declare plainly to have no other Order from the Lords the States, then to &s;ail about, and to view the &s;hore and coa&s;t of our country, as far as O&s;tend and Newport, and no further. By which it doth appear as clearly as the Sun is under heaven that by all means the States of the United Provinces have had no mind to attempt any thing again&s;t the Fleet or other &s;hips of this Common|wealth. If any thing then in this bu&s;ine&s;&s;e be done otherwi&s;e then ought to be, this doth not concern the &s;aid States, but them which have executed the &s;aid bu&s;ine&s;&s;e, and let them make it good. We have been here now almo&s;t &s;ix moneths about the concluding a league, by &s;pe|ciall order of the States, and have delivered &s;ome days ago to your Commi&s;&s;ioners a paper, in which not onely the different points touch|ing the Treaty, but al&s;o the means by which the &s;ame could be brought to a good agreement, and reconciled one with another, were &s;ufficient|ly declared; &s;o that we did expect nothing every day, but a happy end to &s;o good a work; and truly that excellent matter may in very few hours be fini&s;hed. But who &s;hould ever beleeve that &s;o noble a work, and de&s;ired with &s;o many wi&s;hes of all hone&s;t men, and e&s;pecially of all the Churches of the Reformed Chri&s;tian Religion, &s;hould be cut off or hindred by any &s;uch imprudent and turbulent man (who&s;oever he may be) without knowledge &amp; again&s;t the wil of the Lords the States? by Law and cu&s;tome of all nations is very well known, that he to
<PB N="5" REF="3">whom a charge is given in particular things, an Emba&s;&s;adour in pub|lick Bu&s;ine&s;s going beyond the limit of their Commi&s;&s;ions, a General of an army Depopulating without order of his Superiours any grounds of the Neighbours; a wild bea&s;t doing any mi&s;chief after it hath broken its bond, that not the Ma&s;ters but tho&s;e that have broken the bond are obliged, e&s;pecially if the di&s;approving of the &s;ame Ma&s;ters followeth thereupon; which without que&s;tion (if the bu&s;ine&s;&s;e be &s;o as it is rela|ted) is to be expected from the States of the United Provinces. In the mean while we make no doubt, that to attempt any Ho&s;tility be|fore the other party is heard, cannot be approved neither by God, nor by any men, e&s;pecially Chri&s;tians. It is a cu&s;tome by all rea&s;onable na|tions to demand re&s;titution of their Goods if any trouble be done, and in ca&s;e &s;atisfaction be given or offered, to lay a&s;ide all Ho&s;tility. And it is no wonder that all Nations are &s;o much again&s;t war, and inclined to e&s;tabli&s;h a Peace, the War being plainly a cruel Mon&s;ter, a world of evill, and a meer deluge of innocent bloud; therefore the mo&s;t holy Fa|thers of our Religion have expre&s;&s;ely declared the war (although ju&s;t) to be execrable, e&s;pecially in relation to the Chri&s;tians who are taught by their meeke&s;t Savior to &s;pare other mens bloud as well as their own. But among&s;t all kind of wars this is reputed the mo&s;t dete&s;table and horri|ble if between the&s;e nations war be ri&s;en. Truly the experience teach|eth us, that the be&s;t and &s;tronge&s;t wine (if it be corrupted) becomes the &s;owere&s;t Vinegar; and indeed if two Nations having been friends of old times, of the &s;ame Religion, lovers of Liberty, joyning upon the &s;ame &s;ea, next Neighbours, both valiant and warlike be cla&s;hed together, what is to be expected but the ruine of both, and as the Proverb &s;aith; a Cadmean Victory. And what el&s;e is this then to afflict and depre&s;&s;e your Friends and Companions in Religion to plea&s;e your enemies, and to give occa&s;ion openly for to hurt them both. An Author, being none of the lea&s;t among&s;t yours, hath very well compared, as we conceive, both the two Nations to two earthen pots, driving in the &s;ea with this device, if we hurt, we break; He hitted it very well that hone&s;t man, and we may believe you are of the &s;ame opinion. But if the two nations come to an agreement, Oh Lord, what &s;tore of Happine&s;&s;e will this bring forth! The true Gods &s;ervice will be e&s;tabli&s;hed, the Sea be qui|et, &amp; opportunity taken away from all enemies to trouble them both, all Communions in Religion be re&s;oiled, and which is to be reputed the chie|fe&s;t <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">ll, to the mo&s;t good and gracious Lord, Prai&s;es and Thank&s;gi|g<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters">ng will be lift up into the Heavens.</P>
<PB N="6" REF="4">
<P> We conclude then, mo&s;t Honourable Lords, and in&s;tantly demand and de&s;ire, &s;o as we have longed to propo&s;e unto your Honours this three days &s;ince;</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, That a Copy may be given unto us of the Relation of the things that are pa&s;t.</P>
<P>Secondly, That we may &s;end that over by your leave to our Lords the States, and that the other part being heard, the truth of the bu&s;ine&s;s may be known.</P>
<P>Thirdly, That in the mean while all things may be kept whole and untouched.</P>
<P>Fourthly, That by no means the bu&s;ine&s;s of the concluding the Trea|ty be put off, and that &s;uch unfortunate mi&s;chances may be avoided, and an everla&s;ting Peace may be e&s;tabli&s;hed between both the Nations.</P>
<P>All which we de&s;ire of all our hearts, the great and bountifull God, the Author of Peace will be plea&s;ed to grant us.</P>

<HEAD>The an&s;wer of the Parliament of the Common wealth of <HI>ENGLAND.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THe Parliament of the Common-wealth of England, calling to mind with what continued Demon&s;trations of Friend&s;hip and &s;incere Affections, from the very beginning of their inte|&s;tine troubles, they have proceeded towards their Neighbours of the U|nited Provinces, omitting nothing on their part that might conduce to a good corre&s;pondence with them, and to a growing up into a more near and &s;trict Union then formerly, Do find them&s;elves much &s;urprized with the un&s;uitable Returns that have been made thereunto, and e&s;pe|cially at the acts of Ho&s;tility lately commited in the very Roads of England upon the Fleet of this Common-wealth, the matter of Fact whereof &s;tated in clear proofs, is hereunto annexed, Upon &s;erious and deliberate con&s;ideration of all, and of the &s;everal Papers delivered in by your Excellencies to the Councel of State, the Parliament thinks fit to give this an&s;wer to tho&s;e papers:</P>
<PB N="7" REF="4">
<P> The Parl. as they would be willing to make a charita|ble con&s;truction of the Expre&s;&s;ions u&s;ed in the &s;aid Pa|pers, endeavouring to repre&s;ent the late engagement of the Fleets to have hapned without the knowledge, and a|gain&s;t the mind of your Superiors; So when they con&s;i|der how di&s;agreeable to that profe&s;&s;ion the Re&s;olutions and actions of your State and their Mini&s;ters at Sea have been, even in the mid&s;t of a Treaty offered by them&s;elves, and managed here by your Excellencies, the extraordi|nary preparations of One hundred and fifty &s;ail of Men of War, without any vi&s;ible occa&s;ion but what doth now appear (a ju&s;t ground of Jealou&s;ie in your own judge|ments, when your Lord&s;hips pretended to excu&s;e it) and the in&s;tructions them&s;elves given by your &s;aid Superiors to their Commanders at Sea, Do find too much cau&s;e to believe, That the Lords the States General of the United Provinces have an intention, by force to u&s;urp the known Rights of England in the Seas, to de&s;troy the Fleets that are, under God, their Wals and Bulwarks, and thereby expo&s;e this Common-wealth to Inva&s;ion at their plea|&s;ure, as by this late Action they have attempted to do: Whereupon the Parliament conceive they are obliged to endeavour, with Gods a&s;&s;i&s;tance, as they &s;hall have op|portunity, to &s;eek repairation of the wrongs already &s;uf|fered, and &s;ecurity that the like be not attempted for the future.</P>
<P>Neverthele&s;s, with this mind and de&s;ire, That all diffe|rences betwixt the Nations may (if po&s;&s;ible) be peace|ably and friendly compo&s;ed, as God by his providence &s;hall open a way thereunto, and circum&s;tances &s;hall be conducing to render &s;uch endeavors le&s;&s;e dilatory, and more effectual then tho&s;e of this kind heretofore u&s;ed <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">ave been.</P>

<P>But to deviate from circum&s;tances, and to proceed to realities, give me leave to pre&s;ent you with the Proverb of King James, who &s;aid, Fair words would butter no Par&s;nips; Even &s;o it is with the Common-wealth of England: That during an honourable Treaty, high af|fronts have been given, as before &s;pecified, which upon mature deliberation, produced further action; as appears by the Narrative &s;ent to the Councel of State, who upon Sabbath day la&s;t, came to this re&s;ult, That a Letter of thanks &s;hould be returned to Vice-Admiral Peacock, for his gallantry performed upon the Coa&s;t of Flanders; the perfect Relation whereof take as followeth.</P>
<P>Capt. Peacock having intelligence of the Hollanders imperiou&s;ne&s;s, re&s;olved to attempt &s;ome heroick At|chievement for his Countries honour: In pur&s;uance whereof, &s;ailing to the coa&s;t of Flanders, met with two Dutchmen of War, who (upon Command in obedience to the Common-wealth of England) denied to &s;trike &s;ail, in&s;omuch that a bloudy fight began, and after a &s;harp di&s;pute, we &s;unk one, and took another, carrying about 40. pieces of Ordnance; &s;ince which time; divine Provi|dence decreeing victory, about 40 &s;ail are brought into Dover Peer under protection of the Ca&s;tle; for which gallant &s;ervice, the Parliament hath returned a Letter of thanks and gratuity, to the further encouragement of the Sea-men.</P>
