Their laws are of three &s;orts; 1. The lawes of <HI>England,</HI> &s;o far as the people and place can be capable. 2. Lawes wholly of their own. 3. When ca&s;es fall out, that neither of the&s;e will reach, they are to follow &s;uch rules as are cleerly drawn from the word of God: and becau&s;e many men take upon them to in|terpret the Scriptures now adays: &s;o that in&s;tead of one of a thou|&s;and, there appears a thou&s;and to one, which makes them endea|vour (with the able&s;t gifted men God hath given them) to obtaine po&s;itive lawes: for all matters may come in judgment, that Arbitra|rine&s;&s;e may be avoided. And now becau&s;e the courage, dexterity, and skill of Commanders appeareth mo&s;t when they meete with their enemie: know foure &s;orts of per&s;ons have battered this go|vernment not only with their greater Artillery, at 900. leagues di|&s;tance, but with continuall &s;mall &s;hot at 10. or 12. and &s;ometimes at pi&s;toll-&s;hot, rai&s;ing over-topping batteries, bre&s;t-works, &amp; out|facing Galleries, delving deepe to undermine the foundation (though built on the &s;ure&s;t rocke) ca&s;ting forth fierce fireing gra|nadoes, u&s;ing all the &s;tratagems &s;uch cunning Engineers could po&s;|&s;ibly

<PB N="13" REF="8">to prevent the &s;preading of this gangrin, they endeavour the di&s;|per&s;ing of this red Regiment. Some at lo&s;&s;e of e&s;teeme voluntarily depart, others were bani&s;hed, and others with-drawing &s;ubmitted againe to the godly government of this Common wealth.</P>
<P>The third &s;torm this government felt was from the &s;cum of the former under the command of <HI>Samuel Gorton,</HI> who knowing &s;ome of his Sectaries were clo&s;ely lurking behind in this government; &s;ent forth his bla&s;phemies to thunder downe all government as diabolicall, raging and railing again&s;t Magi&s;trates and generall Courts, as murtherers, ab&s;olving from their obedience all &s;uch as would follow their opinion; had not the conceitedne&s;&s;e of their own elegancy hindered, they might have done much hurt, their leader being a very dangerous, bold-&s;poken fellow, and full of &s;awning; with which, having gained &s;ome 12. or 13. families to cide with him, inforcing land from the poore <HI>Indians</HI> by meanes of the mo&s;t potent Sachim of tho&s;e parts, under who&s;e friend&s;hip they bare them&s;elves bold again&s;t the united Colonies, building on the Indians land, having outed them&s;elves from all governe|ment, would not &s;ubmit to any law or common rea&s;on, de&s;perate|ly going on, threatning bloud and death to any &s;hould come to ap|prehend them; Yet at length were hand&s;omely apprehended with|out one drop of bloud &s;pilt, for all their great boa&s;ter, brought to a generall Court, and there proceeded again&s;t: yet &s;o &s;lenderly (their offence being very de&s;tructive to all government: And of &s;uch an high nature) that their malice encrea&s;ing, their Cen&s;ure did but exa&s;perate, and not at all di&s;inabled them to pro&s;ecute as formerly the great di&s;turbance, if not overthrow of this little com|mon-wealth; the&s;e per&s;ons yet remain, battering the united Colo|nies with all the force they are able to make: and as they deny go|vernment among Chri&s;tians, &s;o they endeavour to overthrow one government with another.</P>
<P>The 4^t^h on&s;et was made by a Doctor of phy&s;ick, as Commander in chiefe, with &s;ixe other inferiour Officers, who pretended they had thou&s;ands on their &s;ide: &amp; therefore to mu&s;ter up al the force they could, proclaim (at a generall Court) them&s;elves to be leaders to all di&s;contented per&s;ons, who di&s;liked any thing this govern|ment had done (plau&s;able to all the &s;tragling <HI>Bona&s;o&s;ia</HI>'s and Prela|ticall faction, that had hid them&s;elves in holes &s;ince the former bickering) and furni&s;hing them with fre&s;h weapons, teaching them

Thus furni&s;hed, they made &s;trong oppo&s;ition, &s;ome of them boa&s;ting what a day they &s;hould get: but their great numbers failing them, and in &s;tead of thou&s;ands, there appeared not thirty: and further being apprehended in mid&s;t of their project, were impri&s;oned, and fined forther folly: yet but little in re&s;pect of their offence. Only thus much &s;ome have learned, to &s;hew &s;o much clemency to their adver&s;aries, that it proves cru|elty to their friends. What faithfulne&s;&s;e, courage and ju&s;tice in all the&s;e pa&s;&s;ages have been &s;hewed by tho&s;e in authority, cannot be waned by the reproachfull words, and piercing lookes of pale|fac'd envy.

<L>Some buy the truth: for con&s;cience liberty,</L>
<L>Error's brought in to blind men damningly.</L>
</LG>
<P>And now before I end, let me tell thee who are like to reap be|nefite by tran&s;porting them&s;elves to tho&s;e Colonies: Fir&s;t, Mer|chants who are skild in commerce with forraigne nations, lying near the Indies, and well &s;tored with &s;hip provi&s;ion cheaper than <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>Secondly, Sea-men are well imploid, if skild in Navigation, &s;hipping increa&s;ing every day, and would be farre more, had they Ma&s;ters to manage the work.</P>
<PB N="25" REF="15">
<P>Thirdly, Has band-men are like to benefit them&s;elves much all &s;orts of cattell increa&s;ing exceedingly, and tillage pro&s;pering, that thou&s;ands of Acres are broken up yearly.</P>
<P>Fourthly, all manuall occupations are falling into their ranks and places daily, (onely Printers of Cards, and Dice-makers, I could wi&s;h to forbeare,) very few but have increa&s;ed in the riches of this life; and further how now men of e&s;tates may im|prove what they have to their great advantage. And this I dare a&s;&s;ure that one hundred pounds will doe that which five hundred could not doe at fir&s;t planting of this little Common-wealth, which was the rea&s;on &s;o many &s;unk in their e&s;tates; but now they &s;ee it too late, and &s;ome will not wait the Lords lea&s;ure for re|pairing, but for&s;ake their &s;tation, with others have gained much, and carry it to other places to &s;hew, and &s;o lo&s;e it again. But my <HI>Iohn,</HI> be thou more &s;table.</P>
<P>La&s;t, let all tho&s;e who de&s;ire to have them&s;elves di&s;covered to them&s;elves, re&s;ort to this place; where, if they &s;eek not them|&s;elves they may finde them&s;elves, if not already lo&s;t in &s;elfe-con|ceitedne&s;&s;e of &s;ome &s;trong opinion, for which if they de&s;ire to be admired, let them leave this long voyage, and keep at home.</P>
