<P>LA&s;t Night, there arrived here upon a &s;mall Barque from <HI>Ireland,</HI> &s;everal Officers who left our Camp on the <HI>Thur&s;|day</HI> before, from whom I have re|ceived the following Account of Af|fairs there, which I have thought fit to Communicate to you.</P>
<P>That one Mr. <HI>R. K.</HI> an Attorney, and one Mr. <HI>Hutchi&s;on</HI> a principal Gun|ner in the Town of <HI>Cork</HI> with &s;ome others, having with &s;ome difficulty made their E&s;cape from <HI>Dublin</HI> in a &s;mall Boat, did on <HI>Tue&s;day</HI> before the&s;e Gentlemen came away, get &s;afe to <HI>Donaghdee,</HI> and being brought before the Duke of <HI>Schonberg,</HI> they were Examined upon &s;everal things relating to the Condition of Affairs at <HI>Dublin.</HI> The &s;ub&s;tance of their An&s;wer con&s;i&s;ted of the following particulars. <Q REND="margQuotes">That Collonel <HI>Buchan</HI> with &s;ome orher Offic<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">rs, was &s;ent by the late King into <HI>Scotland,</HI> in a <HI>Scotch</HI> Fri|gat of twenty eight Guns, which had been refitted at <HI>Dublin,</HI> with Cloaths and Arms, and &s;everal Com|mi&s;&s;ions, in order to rai&s;e Di&s;tur|bances and Commotions in that Kingdom, and that they are gone for <HI>Innerlochy,</HI> where Sir <HI>Evan Ca|meron,</HI> Lord of <HI>Locheale</HI> Commands. That the late King is in daily Ex|pectation of the Arrival of Six or Seven thou&s;and <HI>French</HI> men from <HI>France,</HI> whether an equal Number of <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> is to be &s;ent in lieu of them, under the Command of Lieutenant General <HI>Mackarty,</HI> who lately made his E&s;cape from <HI>Inniskilling.</HI> That the Earl of <HI>Clancarty</HI> having been &s;ome time &s;ince out of Favour, was upon his Unkle's return to <HI>Dublin,</HI> re&s;tored again to his Regiment of Hor&s;e. That Mon&s;ieur <HI>le Comte D'Avaux</HI> the <HI>French</HI> Amba&s;&s;ador in <HI>Ireland,</HI> is preparing for his return back again into <HI>France,</HI> from whence they &s;ay, He is to go in Quality of Amba&s;&s;ador Extraordinary to <HI>Rome;</HI> at the &s;ame time, the <HI>Comte de Ro&s;e,</HI>
<PB N="2" REF="2"> the <HI>French</HI> Governor of <HI>Cork,</HI> makes account to return, he being much out of Favour, for having abu&s;ed the Tru&s;t the late King had put up<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter"> him, and for defrauding the Coun|try he Commanded in, of Five and thirty thou&s;and Pounds, which they &s;ay he &s;ent to <HI>France</HI> &s;ome while ago. The <HI>French</HI> Go<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ernour of <HI>Drog|heda,</HI> is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">h the &s;ame Circum&s;tances of Di&s;grace, being found Guilty of fal&s;e Mu&s;ters, and of receiving of the Pay of Six hundred Men (for a con|&s;iderable time) more then he actu|ally had; he is to return into <HI>France</HI> at the &s;ame time that Mon|&s;ieur </Q><HI>D'Avaux</HI> does.</P>
<P>That the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Hor&s;e are much &s;poll'd and dimini&s;hed in their Numbers, in&s;omuch, that it is generally be|lieved that the late King will not be able to bring into the Field the next Campaign, nothing nigh &s;o good a Body of Men or Hor&s;e, as he did la&s;t year; and that for all the great noi&s;e that was made of their mighty num|bers then, Mr. <HI>K.</HI> &s;ays, That they were at no time more than Six thou|&s;and Hor&s;e.</P>
<P>That they have made &s;ome Fortifi|cations about <HI>Dublin,</HI> &s;uch as Tren|ches and Pali&s;adoes, and &s;et up Gates on the &s;everal Bridges of the Town; but that there has not been &s;o raging a Sickne&s;s among&s;t the Inhabitants of <HI>Dublin,</HI> nor &s;uch Mortality as was talked of; tho it was very great among&s;t the Army, and they carried the &s;ame where&s;oever they came. That the late King is at <HI>Dublin,</HI> where there are only three Regiments Quar|tered, and two Regiments more at <HI>Drogheda,</HI> the re&s;t of the Army being Quartered up and down in <HI>Mun|&s;ter.</HI></P>
<P>They further &s;ay, That the Prote|&s;tants in <HI>Dublin</HI> have all their Churches but <HI>Chri&s;t Church,</HI> which i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter"> employ'd by the Roman Catholicks; that there have been no hard&s;hips put upon them of late, and that all things are pretty plenty there, con&s;idering the Circum&s;tances they are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">nder, ex|cepting Bread; the &s;carcity of Corn being occa&s;ioned by the late Kings rai&s;ing the Copper Money to double the Value that it pa&s;t for at fir&s;t, which made the Country-people unwilling to bring their Corn to Market, but that that was pre&s;ently remedy'd by a Proclamation, wherein all Per&s;ons were &s;trictly Commanded to bring in their Grain to the Market, threatning withal, that in ca&s;e they forbore bringing their Corn as formerly, the &s;ame &s;hould be taken from them by the Army, and expo&s;e them all to Mi|litary Execution; which had &s;uch an Operation on the People, that they began immediately to repair to the Market with their Corn. And that one of the Ships that carried over the Money and Cloaths for our Army, had been in &s;ome danger of &s;triking on an un&s;een Rock, in&s;omuch, that the Ma&s;ter quitted her, and gave her over for lo&s;t; but that the Ma&s;ters Mate continued on Board her, and had the good luck to bring her &s;afe into <HI>Carrick-fergus.</HI></P>
<P>This is all that I have at pre&s;ent to acquaint you with, on the truth whereof you may rely, having had it from the Mouths of tho&s;e that are come lately from tho&s;e Parts.</P>
