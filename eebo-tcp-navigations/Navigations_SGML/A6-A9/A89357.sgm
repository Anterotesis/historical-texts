<ARGUMENT>
<P>How certain Pirates of the Moors pre&s;ented to <HI>Magadan,</HI> King of <HI>Saba,</HI> the <HI>Gen|tleman of the Burning Sword.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>_IN the Kingdom of <HI>Saba,</HI> there &s;ometime Reign'd a <HI>Moor,</HI> call'd <HI>Magadan,</HI> who; contrary to the u&s;ual Nature of Blacks, was affable, courteou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">, and debonair, loving, above all people, &s;uch as were White, whom he much more willingly employ'd, than any others. This <HI>Magadan</HI> took to Wife a noble Lady, nam'd <HI>Buruca,</HI> black like him&s;elf: And of the&s;e two, was born the valiant <HI>Fulurtin,</HI> of whom our Hi&s;tory will &s;ometimes make men|tion. This <HI>Fulurtin,</HI> who, for good conditions, re&s;embled his Father, was in his younger years in&s;tructed in all forreign Languages, by <HI>Mandaiar,</HI> a white Slave, a Man of wonderful Learning. Now it was well known, thro' all the Realm of <HI>Saba,</HI> how great Plea&s;ure the King took in getting Pri&s;oners from forreign Parts, e&s;pecially from the <HI>North,</HI> becau&s;e of their whitene&s;s: In&s;o|much, that he often pardoned even Crimes of High-Trea&s;on, provided the Cri|minals pre&s;ented him with &s;uch Per&s;onages.</P>
<P>Hence it happened, that one day, as he ro&s;e from Table, there entred into the Hall four <HI>Moors,</HI> leading by the Hand, a <HI>LITTLE GENTLEMAN,</HI> about
<PB N="2" REF="8"> <HI>THREE</HI> Years old, of a &s;ingular Perfection in Beauty. Having acco<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ding to their manner done their Reverence to <HI>Magadan,</HI> one of them &s;pake thus: <HI>Sir, the two Brethren, that &s;lew Your Co&s;en, pro&s;trate them&s;elves in all humility at Your Maje&s;ty's Feet, be&s;eeching You to accept of this Child, who, be&s;id<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">s <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">he excellency of his Per&s;on, has brought from his Mothers Womb a marvellous</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 word"> This &s;aid, &s;lipping off a little yellow Taffery Coat, he had on, they &s;hew'd before <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ll that were pre&s;ent, a Sword, as red as Fire, the Pommel proceeding from his left Kn&eacute;e, and the Point terminating near his Nipple; It had on it certain white Characters, which were then unknown to any, even to <HI>Mandaiar</HI> him&s;elf, tho' there were in that Age few who equall'd him in Learning. The King, extreamly pleas'd with &s;o Fair a Pre&s;ent, and much more wondering at the Natural Sword the Child had on his Body, would have him call'd the <HI>Gentleman</HI> of the <HI>Burning Sword,</HI> gi|ving him at that very moment to his Son <HI>Fulurtin,</HI> who thenceforward &s;o greatly affected him, that he made him his &s;econd &s;elf, &s;o that one of them could not live without the other, ordinarily exerci&s;ing them&s;elves in all Virtuous Pa&s;times.</P>
<P>Now before I pa&s;s any farther, 'tis fit you under&s;tand, that this Gentleman was that very Child, whom (as you find it Recorded in the &s;ixth Book of <HI>Amadis</HI> of <HI>Gaul Garinda,</HI> one of <HI>Onoloria</HI>'s Women left on the bank of the River, as &s;he was carrying him to the Port of <HI>Filina</HI> to Nur&s;e, whence being taken away by the&s;e Cor&s;airs into their Ve&s;&s;el, he was brought up by them, till they pre&s;ented him to King <HI>Magadan,</HI> who on this occa&s;ion not only forgave them his Co&s;ens death, for which they were fled, but al&s;o be&s;tow'd on them many great Benefits; &s;o agreeable to him was the <HI>Gentleman of the Burning Sword,</HI> who, growing up, became &s;o fair and goodly of Stature, that at Eight Years of Age he was taken to be above Twelve, &s;o conforming him&s;elf withal to the Humour of Prince <HI>Fulurtin,</HI> that he could not be without him. They were both In&s;tructed in all good Literature, as al&s;o in Wre&s;tling, Managing the great Hor&s;e, Ca&s;ting the Bar, Fencing, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 word"> o|ther Exerci&s;es fitting for Gentlemen of their high Qualities. And tho' the <HI>Gen|tleman of the Burning Sword</HI> became &s;o expert in all the&s;e things, that he had not his Equal; yet &s;o great was the Honour and Reverence, he bare his Prince <HI>Fulur|tin,</HI> that he would never contend with him; by which he &s;o highly gain<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">d <HI>Magadans</HI> Affection, that he ordinarily took him to all places of Plea&s;ure, whether it were to Hunt the Stag, or other Diver&s;ion whatever.</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P>How King <HI>Magadan,</HI> being a Hunting, was A&s;&s;aulted by a great Bear, and deli|ver'd from Death by the Gentleman of the Burning Sword.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>SOme Years after, the King of <HI>Saba</HI> having caus'd the Toils to be &s;pread in the next Forre&s;t, as he &s;tood watching for a &s;tout Bore in the mid&s;t of a great Path, having a &s;harp Bore-Spear in his hand, there ru&s;ht out of a Thicket a Bear, who,
<PB N="3" REF="8"> frighted with the barking of the Hounds, and &s;ound of the Trumpets, &s;ought which way to &s;ave him&s;elf) Now <HI>Magadan</HI> was at that time accompany'd only by the <HI>Gentleman of the Burning Sword,</HI> who held in a &s;lip a Greyhound, w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ich, &s;py|ing the Bear, got his head out of the Collar, and ran to a&s;&s;ault him; but the Bear &s;truck him &s;o furiou&s;ly with one of his Fore-feet, that he brake his Iaws, and imme|diately turn'd again&s;t the King, who defended him&s;elf with his Bore-Spear. But the Bear &s;o fiercely charg'd the King, that having got the Spear out of his hands, he clos'd with him, and threw him on the ground. The Gentleman &s;eeing this ran &s;peedily to help the King and drawing out a Wood-Knife, w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ich hung at his Gir|dle, gave the Bea&s;t &s;o great a blow, that he almo&s;t cut off <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">is Leg. The Bear find|ing him&s;elf wounded, let go his hold, and with open mouth ran upon the Gentle|man, who, undauntedly lifting up his Arm, &s;truck him with &s;o great fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ce between the Ears, that he &s;plit his Head a&s;under.</P>
<P>This done, as he return'd to help up the King, he perceiv'd coming towards him a great Lion, crown'd, and bearing between his Teeth a Child about two Years old, who cry'd with a loud voice: <HI>Alas, Gentleman of the Burning Sword, pray help me; which your Father would not refu&s;e to do, were he here in your place.</HI></P>
<P>The Gentleman was no le&s;s a&s;toni&s;ht to hear the&s;e Words, than to &s;ee him that &s;pake them, towards whom he diligently ha&s;tned to free him from the Danger he was in. The Lion no &s;ooner &s;aw him approach, but letting go the Child, he went to de|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">our the Gentleman, who, &s;tepping a&s;ide, gave the Lion &s;o great a &s;troke with his Knife, that he &s;eparated his leg from his Body: Yet the chafed Bea&s;t, lifting up his other Paw, with his &s;harp claws tare part of the Gentlemans Garment, pulling him al&s;o to him with &s;o much violence, that he threw him on the grounds. The Gen|tleman notwith&s;tanding got quickly up again, and recharging the Lion, wounded him with a back-blow &s;o deep into the Reins, that one might have &s;een his Entrals, the Bea&s;t immediately falling dead on the Gra&s;s. The Gentleman then lookt about to &s;ee what was become of the Child he had &s;uccour'd, and &s;pying him run away a|long a Path, made after him, that he might get him to declare what knowledge he had of him. Having then overtaken the Child, he very affectionately askt him, how he fell into that danger, and whether he had heretofore &s;een him: <HI>For you ere while affirm'd,</HI> &s;aid the Gentleman, <HI>that had my Father been pre&s;ent, he would no more have fail'd to a&s;&s;i&s;t you, than I have done.</HI></P>
<P>The young Child, hearing him &s;peak thus, &s;milingly return'd him this An&s;wer: <HI>Indeed, Gentleman, you are Son to &s;uch a Father, that it will co&s;t you no &s;mall pa ns to re&s;emble him, tho you are Born to receive greater Honour for your H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">gh <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">row|e&s;s and Chivalry, than any one, who has Preceded you; for the re&s;t trouble not your &s;elf to make any father Enquiry, &s;ince you will but lo&s;e your labour.</HI> This &s;aid, he immediately vani&s;ht out of &s;ight, leav<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ng the Gentleman no le&s;s amaz'd than if he had newly ri&s;en out of a dream; yet withal not a little rejo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">cing at what h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter"> had heard.</P>
<P>Being now mo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">e de&s;irous, than before, to know of whom he was De&s;cended, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">he
<PB N="4" REF="9"> turn'd back to the King, whom finding &s;orely bruis'd, and wounded in his Thigh, and other Parts of his Body, by the Outrage of the Bear, he (with Tears in his Eyes) askt him, how he did? <HI>Magadan,</HI> who had curiou&s;ly ob&s;erv'd what befel the Gentleman, as well in his Combat with the Bear, as with the Lion, graciou&s;ly an|&s;wer'd him: <HI>Indeed, my Friend, I am much better than I lately expected, Thanks to our Gods and You: So that never was Education better be&s;tow'd, than that I have given you, &s;eeing the Hazard you have put your &s;elf in to pre&s;erve me; which makes me throughly &s;en&s;ible, that Virtue, once firmly planted, is never lo&s;t.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Sir,</HI> &s;aid the Gentleman, <HI>there is no doubt, but that Virtue is under&s;tood only by Virtue; and yet I well know, that I can never all my life &s;atisfy the Benefits, I have already receiv'd of your Maje&s;ty. Neverthele&s;s, I humbly pray our great God</HI> Iu|piter, <HI>to grant me the Favour, that my Power may one day corre&s;pond with my Will, and then &s;hall be clearly manife&s;ted the De&s;ire I have to obey and &s;erve your Maje&s;ty. But Sir, I think it convenient, to look for &s;ome of your Hunt&s;men, or &s;ome others, that may carry you into the Town; for as far as I can perceive, the Bear has dealt very roughly with you.</HI></P>
<P><HI>I de&s;ire you &s;o to do,</HI> reply'd the King. Then the Gentleman cro&s;t thro' the Fo|re&s;t, till he met <HI>Fulurtin,</HI> and many other Gentlemen, who, being Advertis'd of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter"> Misfortune befaln their Prince, were very much di&s;contented, and &s;etting Spurs to their Hor&s;es, Po&s;ted immediately to him, whom they found in a very weak conditi|on, by rea&s;on of the Blood, he had lo&s;t. However, he exactly related to them, what had happened, telling 'em, that had it not been for the a&s;&s;i&s;tance, given him by the <HI>Gen|tleman of the Burning Sword,</HI> he was in greater danger of lo&s;ing his life, than ever he had been from the fir&s;t hour of his Birth. Then making him a Litter, they con|vey'd him to the City of <HI>Saba,</HI> where he was with all imaginable care lookt after by the Queen, who from that very Moment no le&s;s e&s;teem'd the Gentleman, than if he had been her own Son.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. III.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>How <HI>Fulurtin</HI> and the <HI>Gentleman of the Burning Sword</HI> were made Knights by King <HI>Magadan,</HI> and how <HI>Maudan,</HI> &s;timulated by Envy, fal&s;ly accus'd the Queen <HI>Buruca.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>MAgadan</HI> having b&eacute;en in this manner pre&s;erv'd by the <HI>Gentleman of the Burn|ing Sword,</HI> had from that time as great an Affection for him, as if he had been his near Relation, e&s;pecially after he had recounted to him the di&s;cour&s;e, he had with the Child of the Lion; whence the King Imprinted in his Fancy, that he mu&s;t be De&s;cended from Per&s;ons of the highe&s;t Quality: He therefore made him ordinarily fit at his own Table, next to his Son <HI>Fulurtin,</HI> giving him al&s;o a young White Gen|tleman, nam'd <HI>Yneril,</HI> to wait upon him, and be always near his Per&s;on. Thus pa&s;|&s;ed away fome Years, till the Gentleman, belov'd both by Great and Little, was

<P>Now it happened, that <HI>Fulurtin,</HI> who was a little Elder than he, being an Accom|pli&s;ht and Good-natur'd Prince, reque&s;ted the King to give him the Order of Knight|hood, to which he ea&s;ily conde&s;cended.

<P>Now according to the Cu&s;tom of keeping the Ceremonies, the Fea&s;t continu'd the &s;pace of Fifteen days, during which, <HI>Maudan,</HI> Son to one of the gr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ate&s;t Lo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ds of <HI>Saba,</HI> came to Court, to be bred up with <HI>Fulurtin.</HI> He had not been long there, ere he became &s;o jealous, and envious of the Honour, the King did the <HI>Knight of the Burning Sword,</HI> that falling into a deep Melancholly, he was generally thought to be &s;ick. And the more this Poi&s;on gnaw'd his heart, the more did he &s;eek to bring the <HI>Knight of the Burning Sword</HI> into the Kings Disfavour, which when he could not find occa&s;ion to do, he was &s;een hourly to wa&s;t away like Snow before the heat of the Sun.</P>
<P>Now &s;ome time after, <HI>Magadan,</HI> leaving the Queen at <HI>Saba,</HI> went to vi&s;it a Town of his, call'd <HI>Terryna,</HI> during who&s;e Ab&s;ence, the good Lady diverting her &s;elf one day at Che&s;s with the <HI>Knight of the Burning Sword, Fulurtin</HI> and <HI>Maudan,</HI> who were looking on, weary'd with the length of the Game, went fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">th, and left them a|lone. In fine, after &s;ome Mates, in which the Queen had the Victory, &s;he, who (as you have heard) lov'd him, again&s;t whom &s;he play'd, as her own Son, as well for his Vertues, as for the Succour he had given the King, when he deliver'd him from the Peril that befel him as he was hunting, made him &s;it down by her on the Beds-Feet, where di&s;cour&s;ing together without the lea&s;t thought of prejudicing her Honour, &s;he tenderly ki&s;t and embrac'd him. But <HI>Maudan,</HI> who&s;e Envy made him pry after Opportunities to ruine the <HI>Knight of the Burning Sword;</HI> having quit|ted <HI>Fulurtin</HI> to watch them, and &s;eeing their Care&s;&s;es, per&s;waded him&s;elf more than was true, re&s;olving in his w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">cked mind, to acquaint the King with their love at his Return: which was not long after, He having advice, that the Kings of <HI>Arab<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">a</HI> and <HI>Thar&s;us</HI> were coming dwon into his Country to make War upon him. This made him return the &s;ooner to <HI>Saba,</HI> that &s;ending out on every &s;ide to rai&s;e Men, he might go fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">th to meet his Enemies. But &s;carce was he ri&s;en from Supper, when <HI>Maudan,</HI> finding him alone, leaning on a Window in the Pre&s;ence; after a &s;hort Preamble to Palliate his Trea&s;on, began to di&s;cour&s;e him in this manner: <HI>Sir I mo&s;t humbly beg your Maje&s;ty's Pardon, if with the greate&s;t Regret imaginable I di&s;cover to you a thing, which, I wi&s;h, my Death could have prevented, as well for the Di&s;content, it will give your Maje&s;ty, as for the Amity I bear the</HI> Knight of the Burning Sword, <HI>whom I take all our Gods to witne&s;s, I have ever lov'd; honour'd,

But the matter &s;o neerly con|cerning You, &s;hould I, who am your Va&s;&s;al, conceal it, I &s;h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">uld be guilty of the High|e&s;t Trea&s;on, and the Education You have be&s;tow'd on me, would be very ill employ|ed, &s;o that Rea&s;on con&s;trains me to lay a&s;ide all re&s;pect of Per&s;ons, tho' it were of my own Father, for to pre&s;erve the Fidelity I owe You, my Natural Prince, and So|veraign Lord.</HI> Then he declar'd, how he had &s;een the Queen playing at Che&s;s with the <HI>Knight of the Burning Sword,</HI> telling the King the Familiarities, that had pa&s;s'd between them, which he &s;o amplifi'd and enlarg'd, as to aver, that the Queen, abandoning all Mode&s;ty, had violated her Marriage Bed. The King was (not with|out cau&s;e) &s;o a&s;toni&s;ht at hearing this, that being ready to drop down to the ground, that he was a long time unable to utter the lea&s;t word, by rea&s;on of the conte&s;t, there was in his Inte<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ior between the Love he bare the Accus'd, and the di&s;honour had been done him, &s;o that he could not forbear weeping. Having therefore his Face co|ver'd with tears, he ask'd <HI>Maudan, whether it were po&s;&s;ible that the</HI> Knight of the Burning Swo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">d <HI>had &s;o di&s;honour'd him as he had related. Yes Sir,</HI> an&s;wer'd he, <HI>and I will &s;wear it by the living Gods; for I &s;aw it with my own eyes.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Ah, Ah!</HI> &s;aid the King, fetching a deep &s;igh: <HI>Since the Traytor has &s;o far forgot|ten him&s;elf, as I heretofore prefer'd him before all that were in this Kingdom, &s;o will I now cau&s;e him, and the Strumpet his Companion, to be put to the cruel&s;t Death, that ever wretched Creatures &s;uffer'd.</HI></P>
<P>Then the King, commanding <HI>Maudan</HI> to keep &s;ecret what he had told him, retir'd to his Chamber as full of di&s;content, as the Villian was of joy, for having &s;o well accompli&s;ht his de&s;ign. As the Love of a Father to his Son is incomparably greater than common Amities, &s;o the hate of the one to the other, when it grows vigorous is undoubtedly more extream than can be expre&s;t. In like manner the King, who was &s;o affectionated to the Knight of the burning &s;word, that he had almo&s;t equall'd him with <HI>Fulurtin,</HI> having heard the di&s;cour&s;e of this Whi&s;perer, grew &s;o di&s;turb'd, that he had much ado &s;o to govern his Pa&s;&s;ion, as to forbear &s;ending him at that ve|ry moment to receive his la&s;t Puni&s;hment, which yet, tho' not without putting a g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">eat con&s;traint upon him&s;elf, he for a while &s;u&s;pended, hoping to &s;urprize him in the Fact.</P>
<P>Now &s;uch is commonly the Nature of Sin, that 'tis no &s;ooner brought into the Wo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ld, but 'tis attended by Repentance, which was the cau&s;e, that <HI>Maudan,</HI> mix|ing water with his wine, began immediately to know his offence, in&s;omuch that, con&s;idering the many Plea&s;ures and Courte&s;ies he had receiv'd from the Knight, he had accus'd, he wi&s;ht he had never &s;poken ill of him; but when the Steed is &s;toln, 'tis too late to &s;hut the Stable door. Yet did remor&s;e of Con&s;cience, conducted by Rea&s;on, gain &s;o much upon him, that he purpos'd at lea&s;t to &s;ave his life, by giving him notice t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">at the King &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ake of doing him a di&s;plea&s;ure, and advi&s;ing him there|fore to ab&s;ent him&s;elf from his Fury. This thought he put in Execution; A thing probably proceeding from GOD, not for the &s;ake of &s;o wretehed a Per|&s;on, as <HI>Maudan,</HI> but for the pre&s;ervation of the Innocent, for which cau&s;e we
<PB N="7" REF="10"> &s;ometimes &s;ee the Wicked, contrary to his Nature, to leave Evil, and give way to Good.</P>
<P>The Sun was already retir'd behind the Mountains, and the Night approacht, when the Traytor found out the <HI>Knight of the Burn<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ng Sword,</HI> to whom, conceal|ing from him the Poi&s;on which lay hid in his heart, he thus &s;pake: <HI>My dear Friend &s;o much do I de&s;ire your Good, that there cannot any inconvenience befall you, at which I &s;hould not be as much troubled as if it hapned to my &s;elf. 'Tis therefore nece&s;&s;ary, you retire with all po&s;&s;ible &s;peed; for I certainly know, that the King is re&s;olv'd to put you to death, for which purpo&s;e you will be Arre&s;ted at your En|trance into the Palace. The particular cau&s;e indeed I cannot learn, but &s;ome &s;tory has been told him, for which he hates you to extremity.</HI></P>
<P>The Knight of the burning &s;word, as you will ea&s;ily believe, was not a little a|&s;toni&s;ht at this Adverti&s;ement, the truth of which, as not having any way offended, he would &s;oon have que&s;tion'd, had not <HI>Maudan</HI> always pretended a particular kind|ne&s;s for him. He gave therefore &s;o much credit to this Traytor's words, that he immediately commanded <HI>Yneril</HI> his E&s;quire to bring his Arms, and taking Hor&s;e, went &s;ecretly forth of the Town, without any other Attendance, Riding all Night in marvellous di&s;content.</P>
<P>Thus <HI>Maudan</HI> wove the Web, which afterward co&s;t him his life, as &s;hall be decla|red to you. In the mean time the better &s;till to cover his de&s;ign, he went very late in the Evening to the King, to whom he &s;aid: <HI>Sir, I doubt</HI> Yneril <HI>may have over heard &s;ome part of the di&s;cour&s;e, I had with Your Maje&s;ty, about his Ma&s;ter; for I am certainly inform'd he was li&s;tning under the window: Which may be the more ea&s;ily credited, for that I have not &s;ince &s;een the Knight of the burning &s;word, whom I believe you will find to be fled.</HI></P>
<P><HI>That would be ill,</HI> reply'd the King, <HI>therefore, pray, know the certainty of it, and that without delay.</HI></P>
<P>At the&s;e words <HI>Maudan</HI> went &s;trait out of the Palace, to the Knight's Lodgings, returning &s;oon after, as in amaze, to tell the King, he was gone. <HI>Magadan,</HI> hear|ing this &s;ent ha&s;tily to apprehend the Queen <HI>Buruca,</HI> &s;wearing, he would have her burnt alive; at which the poor Lady, who knew not for what occa&s;ion, was very much troubled, and ca&s;ting her &s;elf at the Kings feet, be&s;ought him with hands held up to tell her the cau&s;e of his di&s;plea&s;ure. <HI>Wicked woman,</HI> an&s;wer'd he, <HI>you &s;hall know too &s;oon to your co&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>Then commanding her to be lock'd up, he &s;et Guards upon her, charging them on peril of their lives to keep her &s;afe. After this he &s;ent forth men on all &s;ides to look for the Knight of the burning &s;word, and bring him either alive or dead, <HI>For,</HI> &s;aid the King, <HI>he has acted again&s;t me the greate&s;t Trea&s;on in the world.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Fulurtin,</HI> wondering at this &s;o &s;uddain change, found means to know the cau&s;e <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">f it, which the King would not conceal from him, that he might irritate him the more again&s;t the Knight, who had done him &s;o many Services, not letting him how|ever know from whom he had receiv'd his Information. But the Young Prince, be|ing

<P>Not long after tho&s;e, who had been in que&s;t of the <HI>Knight of the Burning Sword,</HI> return'd without hearing any news of him; at which the King was &s;o enrag'd, that he wanted l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ttle of putting the Queen to death.

<P>At that very in&s;tant there Arriv'd a Courier, bringing him News of the Spoil, the Enemies made in his Realm, into which they were entred. This made <HI>Maga|dan,</HI> who&s;e Army was now ready, march forth to meet them, and give them Battle, the Man being led by <HI>Fulurtin,</HI> and the re&s;t of his Forces by the King him&s;elf, who&s;e Army was divided only into two Squadrons.</P>
<P>The Kings of <HI>Thar&s;us</HI> and <HI>Arabia,</HI> advertis'd of <HI>Magadans</HI> approach, drew up their men in a P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;ture to receive him.

</ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>SO long travell'd the</HI> Knight of the Burning Sword, <HI>with his E&s;quire</HI> Yneril, <HI>that having Travers'd many Leagues without knowing whether, or which way they went, they came at la&s;t into a great Forre&s;t, in which they Rode two whole days be|fore they could find any way out.

<P><HI>The</HI> Moor, <HI>&s;eeing his Youth, and hearing him &s;peak &s;o appo&s;itly, and with &s;o much rea&s;on, was wholly amaz'd, and exceedingly pity'd his condition: for as he utter'd the&s;e Words, the Tears in very great abundance trickled down his Cheeks. Wherefore he &s;aid to him:</HI> Son, the Gods, to try tho&s;e, whom they love, and who are deare&s;t to them, often permit many Adver&s;ities to come upon them, for &s;atis|faction of the Sins, they commit, as men, giving them afterward (in&s;tead of this tran|&s;itory life) Permanent and ever Ble&s;&s;ed Glory. It is therefore nece&s;&s;ary, you con|form your will to their good plea&s;ure, rendring them glory and thanks for all they &s;end you, were it only for the Beauty and good Wit, with which they have endu'd you: which makes me think, that many great things mu&s;t pa&s;s in you, as they have done in &s;everal, who &s;hall &s;erve you for an Example, as that King of great <HI>Brit|tain,</HI> nam'd <HI>Amadis</HI> of <HI>Gaul,</HI> and his Son <HI>E&s;plandian,</HI> Emperor of <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> on whom the Divine Bounty heretofore be&s;tow'd &s;uch Perfections as yours, altho' they ever were, and &s;till are Infidels, maintaining the Law of their CHRIST. But as the Sun affords his Light as well to the Wicked, as the Good: &s;o our Gods indifferently extend their Graces and Mercies upon all Per&s;ons, hoping by that means to bring them to the true knowledge of their Salvation. And tho' it be true, that <HI>Amadis</HI> and <HI>E&s;plandian,</HI> &s;eeking &s;trange Adventures, as all Knights errant are wont to do, very often fell into &s;uch Dangers, that they many times de&s;pair'd of their own lives and &s;afety, and other whiles of ever having Joy, or Plea&s;ure, as you do now; yet after an infinity of Mi&s;eries and Perils, which they e&s;cap'd, Fortune, or to &s;ay bet|ter, the divine Plea&s;ure has rais'd them to that height, that the one is become a great King, and the other a Potent Emperor, neither the one, nor the other having by their Birth any Right, or Pretence to the Countreys, they enjoy, but having ob|tain'd them by the Magnanimity of their Courages, accompany'd with <HI>Prudence, Fortitude,</HI> and <HI>Virtue.</HI> Wherefore, my Son, endeavour to imitate them: for you have Ability and Di&s;cretion enough to re&s;emble them: and our Gods are as power|ful as ever, to convert this your great Sorrow into Joy, &s;urpa&s;&s;ing your extream Di&s;|plea&s;ure, and the Evil, that afflicts you, into far greater Contentment, and Good.</P>

<PB N="12" REF="13"> &s;aid within him&s;elf, <HI>God never pro&s;per me, if I don't deliver them, or dye in the attempt.</HI> And that he might not tire his Hor&s;e, he rode lei&s;urely on till he came to the top of an Hill, whence he might ea&s;ily &s;ee tho&s;e, that conducted the King and his Son, who were &s;et upon two little Nags, having each of them an E&s;quire behind him, which for greater &s;ecurity held them about the middle. The Knight was &s;o mov'd at this &s;pectacle, that without any farther delay he let down the Vi&s;or of his Helmet, and &s;eeing his opportunity, ru&s;ht in among&s;t them, crying with a loud voice, <HI>Stay, Traytors, &s;tay, the Injury, you do &s;uch Noble Princes, &s;hall co&s;t you dear.</HI></P>
<P>The King of <HI>Thar&s;us</HI> and his Brother, who rode foremo&s;t, &s;eeing them&s;elves a&s;|&s;ail'd thus on the &s;udden, put them&s;elves in a po&s;ture of Defence, breaking their &s;taves on him, that ran again&s;t them; but with &s;o much force did the Knight hit the King, that piercing with his Launce both his Shield and Brea&s;t-plate, he threw him out of the Saddle, his Arm in the fall breaking &s;hort in two.

<ARGUMENT>
<P>How after the <HI>Knight of the Burning Sword</HI> had Re&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">u'd the King of <HI>Saba,</HI> and his Son, he entered into the thicke&s;t of the Forre&s;t, where he met with an Old Man, and of the Di&s;cour&s;e they had together.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THe <HI>Knight of the Burning Sword,</HI> having, as you were told, deliver'd <HI>Maga|dan</HI> and <HI>Fulurtin,</HI> turn'd back the way, he came: and tho' he was cruelly woun|ded, yet did not this &s;o much trouble him, as that he did not know the place, where he was, and le&s;s, how to find any help: for the Neighbouring Country appertain'd to the King of <HI>Thar&s;us,</HI> whom he had defeated, which made him greatly fear being known by them, that fled: wherefore he kept him&s;elf as clo&s;e within the Forre&s;t, as he po&s;&s;ibly could, not cea&s;ing to Travel till night, when the Dew, falling into his wounds, much encreas'd their &s;mart.</P>
<P>Being in this pain and trouble, he &s;aw by Moon-&s;hine a Man coming towards him, who at fir&s;t &s;eem'd to have his Face cover'd with a Linnen Cloth; which never|thele&s;s was not &s;o, that Apprehen&s;ion being caus'd by the Whitene&s;s of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">is Hair, and his great Beard. Then the <HI>Knight of the Burning Sword</HI> &s;u&s;pected him to be &s;ome Slave, that was &s;toln away from his Ma&s;ter, and therefore &s;aluted him accor|ding to the Cu&s;tom of the Country, but the Old Man return'd his Salutation in Greek, which the Knight under&s;tood, as al&s;o all other Languages, having learned them of his Ma&s;ter <HI>Mandaiar.</HI> Wherefore he began to &s;ay to him in the &s;ame Lan|guage: <HI>Honourable Father, can you inform me of any Place near, where I may find a Remedy for &s;ome Wounds, I have on my Body?</HI></P>
<P><HI>If you were a <HI>Chri&s;tian,</HI> as I am,</HI> an&s;wer'd the Old Man, <HI>I &s;hould certainly &s;atis|fy you.</HI></P>
<P><HI>In good &s;aith,</HI> &s;aid the Knight, <HI>this ought not to hinder you: for Vertue is ne|ver lo&s;t, in what place &s;oever it is exercis d, &s;ince it &s;till continues Vertue. If then
<PB N="14" REF="14"> it be in you, I be&s;eech you to tell me, what <HI>I</HI> ask, and &s;ince you are more oblig'd to your &s;elf, than to any other, delay not &s;o good a work, if you can do it for the Gods are reverenc'd only for the Good, we hope to receive from them, and which is in them. And therefore, tho' you are not of their Law, cea&s;e not to imitate them, in what is good, &s;ince I my &s;elf, who am not a <HI>Chri&s;tian,</HI> but a <HI>Pagan,</HI> would follow your GOD, in what &s;hould &s;eem to me<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter"> ju&s;t, and equitable: &s;e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="3 letters">g the Ver|tue, of which I &s;peak, in what place &s;oever it be lodg'd, is always vertuous, mak|ing tho&s;e, in whom it is, re&s;emble the Divinity.</HI></P>
<P><HI>You &s;peak &s;o well,</HI> reply'd the Old Man, <HI>that you &s;hall find in me, what you de|&s;ire: alight then, and I will &s;uccour you: for it would go ill with you, &s;hould you be known in this Countrey, whence you would not afterward get ea&s;ily out.</HI></P>
<P>The Knight incontinently obey'd this Coun&s;el, wondering neverthele&s;s to hear the Good Man's di&s;cour&s;e, of whom he demanded, how he could tell it, would be dan|gerous for him to be known.</P>
<P><HI>Do not,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>Enquire &s;o far; but let it &s;uffice you, that I know more of your Affairs, than you do your &s;elf: but at pre&s;ent I will &s;ay no more.</HI></P>
<P>Then having apply'd &s;uch Remedies to the Places, where he was wounded, that the Knight found him&s;elf without pain, the Old Man gave him &s;ome Victuals, he had in a Pannier, of which the Knight having eaten, fell into &s;o &s;ound a Sleep, that it was brode day, when he awoke, finding him&s;elf Arm'd, not with the black Arms, which <HI>Yneril</HI> had brought him in exchange for his own, but with other white ones, much richer and &s;tronger, with a Shield, &s;uitable to them, in the mid&s;t of which was painted a Sword, re&s;embling that, he Naturally had on his Body.</P>
<P>The Knight, then exceedingly wondering, how this had befaln him was &s;o perplext that he much doubted, whether he were not in a Dream, e&s;pecially when he no longer &s;aw the Old Man, that had cur'd him. Being thus in a mu&s;e, he &s;py'd coming a|long the Way a Dam&s;el, mounted on a Palfrey, accompany'd by an E&s;quire, whom he knew: for it was <HI>Yneril.</HI> This Woman, as &s;he came near him, appear'd &s;o Old and Feeble, that &s;he could &s;carce keep her &s;elf on her Hor&s;e: He neverthele&s;s g aci|ou&s;ly &s;aluted her, who askt him, <HI>If he could tell her any News of a very Ancient Man, that went before her.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Indeed,</HI> an&s;wer'd he, <HI>I &s;hould be glad to hear &s;ome of him, for the great de&s;ire, I have to find him.</HI></P>
<P><HI>And greater you would have,</HI> &s;aid the Old Woman, <HI>did you know him as well, as I do.</HI></P>
<P>This &s;aid, &s;he &s;mote her Palfrey, and pa&s;s'd on, leaving him, to whom &s;he &s;pake, very Anxious, yet well pleas'd at <HI>Yneril</HI>'s Arrival, whom he askt, <HI>who brought him thither.</HI></P>
<P><HI>On my Faith Sir,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>I &s;hall willingly tell you. As I was going out of the Forre&s;t, where I left you, the Old Woman, which &s;pake to you, addre&s;t her &s;elf to me, bidding me in your name follow her, and &s;he would bring me wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">re we &s;hould find
<PB N="15" REF="14"> you at this very hour. Thus we came together, &s;he telling me by the way, that her Old Husband was with you, di&s;cour&s;ing you about things, which were of great importance to you, and, as far as I can under&s;tand, &s;he is n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">m'd <HI>&V;rganda,</HI> and he <HI>Alquif.</HI></HI></P>
<P>Now the <HI>Knight of the Burning Sword</HI> had often heard them and their knowledge highly e&s;teem'd in the hou&s;e of King <HI>Magadan,</HI> wherefore, as if &s;ome new Accident had happen'd to him, he cry'd out; <HI>O <HI>Jupiter!</HI> Is it po&s;&s;ible, that the Sage <HI>&V;rganda,</HI> and the Prudent <HI>Alquif</HI> &s;hould come to vi&s;it me?

<P>Then taking Hor&s;e, he gallopt after <HI>Urganda</HI> and <HI>Alquif,</HI> whom he perceiv'd on the top of an h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">gh Hill, where he lo&s;t &s;ight of them, di&s;covering them again after|wards on the Sea-&s;hore, as they were entring into a little Bark, wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">ch four Men began to Row.

Then he askt <HI>Yneril,</HI> whether he could guide him into the I&s;le, he &s;hew'd him.</P>
<P><HI>Yes very well,</HI> an&s;wer'd he: <HI>but I doubt, the Air of the <HI>Sea</HI> may prejudice your Wounds.</HI> And this he &s;aid, becau&s;e the Knight had told him, what had befaln him upon the deliverance of <HI>Magadan.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Trouble not thy &s;elf,</HI> &s;aid the Knight: <HI>I have no hurt, that &s;hould hinder my Enterprize.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Since it is &s;o,</HI> an&s;wer'd <HI>Yneril, let us alight, and leave our Hor&s;es to feed till our return.</HI></P>
<P>They did &s;o, and entred into the Skiff, which <HI>Yneril</HI> began to Sail, &s;o t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">at they Arri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">'d at the I&s;le about Sun-&s;et.

</ARGUMENT>
<P>TEn Days and Ten Nights were the <HI>Knight of the Burning Sword</HI> and <HI>Yneril,</HI> in the Condition, you have heard putting all their hope of Life in the Good Plea|&s;ure
<PB N="16" REF="15"> of their God <HI>Neptune,</HI> and others, whom they ince&s;&s;antly invok'd, till that one morning the Sun began to get the Ma&s;tery, and the Sea to become calm. Then they di&s;cover'd an high Coa&s;t, to the Foot of which it pleas'd <HI>Fortune</HI> to drive them. The Country &s;eem'd to them &s;o Plea&s;ant&punc; and well adorn'd with tall Trees. that to Refre&s;h them&s;elves, they determin'd there to enter into harbour, and know, whether the place were Inhabited. For this rea&s;on they went a&s;hore, where they &s;ound a little path, that led them to a Mona&s;tery, before which there was erected an high Wooden Cro&s;s. Now the <HI>Knight of the Burning Sword</HI> had never &s;een &s;uch a Sign, wherefo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">e he askt <HI>Y<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">il, if he knew what it meant.</HI></P>

<P>This News greatly pleas'd the <HI>Knight of the Burning Sword,</HI> who hop'd to find &s;ome Adventure, and prove him&s;elf in &s;uch &s;ort, as to do &s;ome glorious Act of Chi|valry to the Augmentation of his Religion. Wherefore pa&s;&s;ing farther, they found the door of a Church open, in the front of which were three fair Altars, adorn'd with Sacerdotal Ornaments, together with &s;ome Repre&s;entations of Saints, accor|di<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">g to the Cu&s;tom of the Faithful, and pre&s;ently they heard &s;everal Voices of Men, &s;inging, tho' they &s;aw not any one, at which being wholly amaz'd, they came as far as the Quire of the Church, where they &s;aw a Sepulchre of Alaba&s;ter, cover'd with a very clear Cry&s;tial, under which was the Effigies of a Knight, compleatly Arm'd, and round about were engraven the&s;e following Words.</P>
<P><HI>Here lies the Valiant and Magnanimous <HI>Matroco,</HI> who before his death had (thro' the Grace of GOD) knowledge of the Eternal Life, and as a Champion of <HI>JES&V;S CHRIST,</HI> made him&s;elf with his own Blood the &s;ign of the Cro&s;s, which he ador'd, dying very happily in the Faith of the Elect.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Knight of the Burning Sword</HI> knew well by the Contents of this Epitaph, that <HI>Yneril</HI> had told him the Truth, and that this was indeed a <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> Countrey, when at the very in&s;tant came forth a Religious Man, prepar'd to &s;ay Ma&s;s, who, &s;eeing this Stranger &s;o fair, young, and well proportion'd, knew not well, what to think of him; however, without long amu&s;ing him&s;elf, he began the Divine Service, in which the Knight took &s;o much Plea&s;ure, that he had the Patience to &s;tay, till the Ceremonies were ended, the good Father ea&s;ily perceiving by his Behaviour, and the little Reverence, he &s;hew'd, that he was indeed no <HI>Chri&s;tian.</HI></P>
<P>Having therefore put off h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">s Alb, and fini&s;ht his Ori&s;ons, he Addre&s;t him&s;elf to the Knight, &s;aying: <HI>Sir Knight, I de&s;ire you not to conceal from me, of what Country you are, who, without any regard to &s;o holy a Place, have made no accout of Di|vine Service, whil&s;t I was celebrating Ma&s;s.

<P>Di&s;cour&s;ing in this manner, they came to the Bridge, adjoyning to the Fortre&s;s, which they were a pretty while in Viewing, and there the Knight took his Helmet, and Shield, commanding <HI>Yneril</HI> to &s;tay there for him, and not to pa&s;s any farther, which was very grievous to him. Then he marcht bravely on, till he came near the fir&s;t Tower, at the Window of which he perceiv'd two Knights, playing at Che&s;s, the one bigger than the other, each of them about Fifty Years of Age, and both clad in Black.

<P>He, to whom he &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ake, was not at all frighted at the&s;e menaces; but without ta|king any farther notice of them, came as far as the Gate, and then gave him this An&s;wer: <HI>Sir Knight, cau&s;e the Ca&s;tle-Gate to be open'd, and let me in, and I will &s;atisfie you, and the Cu&s;tom.</HI></P>

<P>As he fini&s;ht his Speech, there pre&s;ented him&s;elf another Knight, younger, but &s;o big, that he of the <HI>Burning Sword</HI> was &s;omewhat amaz'd at him; yet made he no &s;emblance of any &s;uch thing: but &s;aid to the other, <HI>You may peradventure be deceiv'd: for, if I can, I will renew the Good, of which you have depriv'd this Country, to &s;ow therein &s;o much Evil.</HI></P>

<P>Scarce had he utter'd the Word, but they retir'd from the Window; and a little after there was a Po&s;tern open'd, at the entrance of which, an Arm'd Knight pre&s;en|ted him&s;elf, who, ho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ding his Shield ready for Combat, &s;aid to him of the <HI>Burn|ing Sword, Come in poor Man, and perhaps I will have Mercy on thee.</HI></P>

<P>Then he of the <HI>Burning Sword</HI> entred, and &s;oon after began &s;uch a Combat be|tween them, that to hear the Blows, they gave each other, you would have ta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">en to be two Smiths beating on an Anvil.

Which being &s;een by tho&s;e, that beheld them, they were very much troubled, believing him to be &s;lain, nor did the <HI>Knight of the Burning Sword</HI> think any le&s;s. Wherefore he left him, and pa&s;s'd on, till he came in to the Court, where he found ten Servants, Arm'd with Br<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">gandins, who ran upon him, crying out: <HI>Wicked Infidel, Enemy to GOD and his Faith, thou &s;halt now pay for thy Ra&s;hne&s;s, which has brought thee hither:</HI> and immediately they environ'd him on all &s;ides.</P>
<P>But he, as being the be&s;t Knight in the World, fac'd them with &s;o much Courage, that they &s;oon felt the weight of his Blows, whoever he &s;truck, being a&s;&s;ur'd either of Death, or a Wound, wherefore they began to retreat by little and little, and not without cau&s;e: for Three of them were in a little time lay'd dead on the place, which &s;o mov'd the others to revenge, that they re&s;olv'd either to kill him, or to lo&s;e every man of them their Lives: pre&s;&s;ing therefore more clo&s;e upon him, than they had <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">i|therto done, he neverthele&s;s knew &s;o well how to defend him&s;elf, that before the par|ting of the Game, two more of them were overthrown, &s;haking their Heels.

<P>So clo&s;e at the Heels were they follow'd by the <HI>Knight of the Burning Sword,</HI> that they had not time to &s;hut the door, but he entred after them into the mid&s;t of the place, where he heard the voice of one, that &s;aid to him, <HI>Devil, Enemy of GOD, thou &s;halt dy by my hands the mo&s;t cruel Death, that ever brought Wretch to the End of his days.</HI></P>
<P>Then he perceiv'd the Gyant, he had &s;een at the Window, who, being compleatly Arm'd, and holding his Sword drawn in his hand, came to a&s;&s;ault him.

<P>This offer made the <HI>Knight of the Burning Sword</HI> have a very great E&s;teem for <HI>Frandalo,</HI> whom having thank'd for his Civility, he return'd him this An&s;wer: Frandalo, <HI>believe me, that I am not yet &s;o debilitated, as to &s;tand in need of Repo&s;e, &s;o that I do not &s;ee now any cau&s;e <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">o retard our Combat: wherefore look to your Defence.</HI></P>

At which the King of <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> being amaz'd, continually pray'd for the <HI>Knight of the Burning Sword,</HI> hoping by his Victory to regain his Liberty. Neverthele&s;s, con&s;idering the &s;hocks, he had already &s;u&s;tain'd, and what he mu&s;t &s;uffer more, he very much doubted of that, which he would mo&s;t &s;ecure him&s;elf of, &s;eeing him, in his Opinion, as brisk, as if he had not handled his Sword that day.

<P>So well was the <HI>Knight of the Burning Sword</HI> &s;atisfy'd with this Remon&s;trance, that he &s;aid with<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">n him&s;elf, I &s;hould indeed be very much to blame, &s;hould I endea|vour any farther to force him, who, being depriv'd of all Strength, has already van|qui&s;ht

<P>At this cry the other left <HI>Frandalo,</HI> and taking off his Helmet, addre&s;t him&s;elf to the King, kneeling down before him to ki&s;s his hands, but the King embrac'd him, &s;aying: <HI>Indeed I do not know, that ever I have &s;een you before: Therefore pray do me the favour to tell me, what knowledge you have of me, and who you are.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Sir,</HI> an&s;wer'd he, <HI>be pleas'd to command &s;ome one from within to bind up the Wounds of the&s;e Knights, before they dye: for it would di&s;content me, &s;eeing their Prowe&s;s, that any of them &s;hould peri&s;h for want of help.

<P>Then he call d a Servant, whom he &s;ent to fetch one of the Religious, that was skill'd in Chirurgery.

And the <HI>Knight</HI> of the <HI>Burning Sword,</HI> de&s;iring to know, who the fir&s;t was that a&s;&s;aulted him at the Entrance of the Ca&s;tle, they told him, he was nam'd <HI>Bel|leris,</HI> a courteous Per&s;onage, and Nephew to the Admiral <HI>Frandalo.</HI></P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VIII.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>Of the Di&s;cour&s;e the King of <HI>Ieru&s;alem</HI> had with the <HI>Knight of the Burning-Sword</HI> concerning his Liberty, and afterward with <HI>Frandalo</HI> and <HI>Belleris.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>THe next day, after the&s;e things had thus faln out, the King of</HI> Jeru&s;alem <HI>went to vi&s;it the</HI> Knight of the Burning Sword, <HI>whom he found walking about his Chamber, for none of his Wounds were &s;uch, as to oblige him to keep his Bed. And therefore &s;eeing the King enter, he went to receive him, and with great Reverence be&s;ought him to &s;it down in a Velvet Chair, and placing him&s;elf near him, began his di&s;cour&s;e in this manner:</HI> Alas! Sir, how &s;hall I ever be able to acknowledge the Honour, your Maje&s;ty is pleas'd to do me, who am but a &s;imple Knight, and as yet unknown? And neverthele&s;s, you take the pains to come and vi&s;it me, who have never done you any &s;ervice.</P>
<P>My Friend, <HI>an&s;wer'd the King,</HI> he, that can deliver Kings out of Pri&s;on, de&s;erves well to be honour'd by the greate&s;t Lords in the World, and for ever to be than|ked by them. Is it not then rea&s;onable, that I, who&s;e Liberty you have &s;o valiant|ly obtain'd, &s;hould offer my &s;elf to you, and continue all my life your Oblig'd.</P>
<P>Pardon me Sir, <HI>reply'd the Knight,</HI> 'tis a &s;mall matter to pay an Obligation, due by nece&s;&s;ity. Now there is nothing more certain, than that &s;uch, as Your Maje&s;ty, are born into this World, to be Reverenc'd, and &s;erv'd by all, all being naturally o|blig'd &s;o to do, but that Obligation brings along with it this Benefit, that, whoe|ver &s;atisfies it, is thereby honour'd, for as much as the Honour, he pays his Superior, or any other, is of &s;uch a Nature, that it returns to the place, whence it proceeded, as the Rivers and Streams do into the Sea, out of which they came. So that, Sir, you do me wrong to thank me &s;o much, &s;ince it is abundantly &s;ufficient to commend him, who does well, without giving him thanks. For, if he did otherwi&s;e than well, he would not (in rea&s;on) de&s;erve to be call'd a Man, but a brute and &s;en&s;ele&s;s Bea&s;t.</P>
<P><HI>The King, hearing this goung Victorious Knight &s;peak &s;o wi&s;ely, and with &s;o good a Grace, made him only this An&s;wer:</HI> My great Friend, I &s;ee in you &s;o much good Wit, that 'twould be a Folly for me, to think of vanqui&s;hing you either in word or effect: &s;etting a&s;ide therefore this Conte&s;t, I de&s;ire you only to give me your Ad|vice, how we &s;hall henceforward govern our &s;elves here, where there is not one in whom you tru&s;t, but your E&s;quire and my &s;elf. And I much fear, that &s;ome or o|ther is fled to King <HI>Norandel</HI> with News of the Conque&s;t, you have gain'd over <HI>Frandalo.</HI> Now he is &s;o near us, that he will in le&s;s than a moment have Be&s;ieg'd us, and Fortune may &s;hew us her Countenance quite contrary to what it has been in this beginning.</P>
<P>Since you will know what I think, <HI>reply'd the</HI> Knight of the Burning Sword, I will pre&s;ently tell you, I have left at the foot of this Ca&s;tle a Bark, in which we
<PB N="27" REF="20"> will &s;end <HI>Yneril,</HI> accompany'd by one from hence, to the next <HI>Pagan</HI> City, to de|mand A&s;&s;i&s;tance. And in the mean time, con&s;idering the &s;trength of the Place, we &s;hall ea&s;ily keep it again&s;t all A&s;&s;ailants.</P>
<P><HI>This Advice was well approv'd of, &s;o that the E&s;quire and another embarkt imme|diately after Dinner, when the King and the</HI> Knight of the Burning Sword <HI>went to vi&s;it</HI> Frandalo, <HI>whom the King of</HI> Jeru&s;alem <HI>askt, how he did.</HI></P>
<P>Your Maje&s;ty, Sir, <HI>an&s;wer'd he,</HI> may &s;ee, and much better con&s;ider, &s;eeing the incon&s;tancy of Fortune, who towards the end of my declining years has &s;hewn her &s;elf &s;o adver&s;e to me, that &s;he has brought me into Captivity, and under the Power of him, that could vanqui&s;h me, and by that means conquer this Place, with the keeping of which the Emperor my Ma&s;ter had intru&s;ted me: which misfortune is much more afflicting to me, than death it &s;elf. Nor can my life be henceforth other than a trouble to me, &s;ince I de&s;ir'd its continuance only to &s;erve him, who had put me in the Honour and State, in which I ye&s;terday day was.</P>
<P>Ah <HI>Frandalo! &s;aid the King,</HI> You have ever been e&s;teem'd one of the wi&s;e&s;t Knights in the World, and now methinks, you would &s;eem guilty of that, which ne|ver had any place in you, <HI>viz.</HI> Pu&s;illanimity. Pray good Sir, make u&s;e of the Coun&s;el, you have &s;o often given me, thinking to comfort me, whil&s;t I was a Pri&s;o|ner, and to &s;hew the Magnanimity of your heart, taking example by many others, who have pa&s;s'd thro' &s;uch &s;treights, as you are at pre&s;ent in, and out of which you may get with Honour, knowing the Virtue, that is in this Knight, whom I will en|treat for you: for he alone can do it, and no other.</P>
<P><HI>The</HI> Knight of the Burning Sword, <HI>hearing the King &s;peak &s;o much to his Ad|vantage, could not forbear blu&s;hing, wherefore taking up the di&s;cour&s;e, he &s;aid to him:</HI> Sir, your Maje&s;ty may command me in all things. And as for you <HI>Frandalo,</HI> your Goodne&s;s and Loyalty &s;ufficiently &s;atisfie, what you ere while Remon&s;trated to the King, and the Efforts, you made me feel ye&s;terday in defence, of what the Empe|ror had committed to your keeping, will always te&s;tifie the Endeavour, you us'd to &s;erve him faithfully. You have not then any Rea&s;on to complain of Fortune; but ought rather to e&s;teem her favourable to you, than adver&s;e or cruel: &s;ince &s;he has not any way abas'd your Honour, but exalted your Renown by your Lo&s;s, which ought Rather to be e&s;teem'd a Gain, than otherwi&s;e: &s;eeing I bear you more Envy for the Honour, you have gain'd with me, than I &s;hould Glory, had I reduc'd this I&s;land under the Law of our Gods, as it heretofore was.</P>
<P>Sir Knight, <HI>an&s;wer'd</HI> Frandalo, the little knowledge, I yet have of you, will hin|der me perhaps from thanking you for the Prai&s;es, you give me, &s;o highly, as you de&s;erve, &s;o ea&s;ily may it be &s;een, that you de&s;ire in all things to render your Con|ditions, and Prowe&s;s, equal to your Di&s;cretion, and Vertue, not to lo&s;e by Rea&s;ons, and di&s;cour&s;e the Conque&s;t, the Goodne&s;s of your Chivalry has made in me. I will not heretofore any longer contend with you in words, fearing lea&s;t by them you may gain over me, what with the hazard of your Life you could never have obtain'd, which is to make me voluntarily yours.</P>

<P>This &s;aid, he held his Peace, his weakne&s;s not &s;uffering him to &s;peak any more.

<HEAD>CHAP. IX.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>How <HI>Garinda,</HI> &s;ent by <HI>Onoloria,</HI> to fetch from <HI>Filina</HI> the little <HI>Amadis of Greece,</HI> that was lo&s;t, fled thro' de&s;pair into a Wood, not daring to return to her Mi|&s;tre&s;s: and of that, which happen'd.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>YOu will find it Recorded in the mo&s;t Excellent Hi&s;tory of <HI>Amadis of Gaul,</HI> about the latter end of the Sixth Book, how <HI>Onoloria</HI> and <HI>Gricileria</HI> were each of them deliver'd of a fair Son, whom they &s;ent to the Port of <HI>Filina,</HI> to be there Nur&s;t; but Fortune would, that the little <HI>Amadis of Greece</HI> was met by the <HI>Moors,</HI> who carry'd him into their Gallies, where he was bred up by them, and was afterwards nam'd the <HI>Gentleman of the Burning Sword,</HI> as you have been told. Now you are to under&s;tand, that the&s;e two Prince&s;&s;es, thinking <HI>Garinda</HI> had entirely &s;atisfy'd their command, and that the two Children were plac'd with careful Nur&s;es, often &s;ent their faithful Me&s;&s;enger, to enquire how they did, who always told them the quite contrary to what was befaln the little <HI>Amadis.</HI> As for the other, &s;he deliver'd him to a Co&s;en of hers, nam'd <HI>Flori&s;ma,</HI> who &s;oon after became a Widow, having but one only Son, call'd <HI>Florindo,</HI> whom &s;he Educated with the little <HI>Lucencio.</HI> A|bout a Year after which the Empre&s;s of <HI>Trebi&s;ond</HI> came to the Mona&s;tery of <HI>Sancta Sophia,</HI> &s;o di&s;contented, becau&s;e &s;he could have no News of the Emperor, that &s;he re&s;olv'd to continue with her Daughters, and no longer concern her &s;elf with the Government of the Empire. She was receiv'd by them in a manner, &s;uitable to her &s;tate, and they endeavour'd by all means po&s;&s;ible to mitigate her &s;orrow.</P>
<P>Now one day among&s;t the re&s;t it happen'd, that <HI>Onoloria,</HI> de&s;irous to &s;ee her Son, commanded <HI>Garinda</HI> to go and fetch him from <HI>Filina,</HI> and, that &s;he might pre|vent all Su&s;picion, charg'd her expre&s;ly to &s;ay, that he was her Nephew, or Si|&s;ters Son. <HI>Garinda,</HI> &s;eeing what &s;he had &s;o long conceal'd, now upon the point to be di&s;cover'd, went her way &s;o exceeding melancholly, that &s;he wi&s;ht her &s;elf dead. In this de&s;pair &s;he betook her &s;elf to the Thicke&s;t part of the Forre&s;t, fully purpo&s;ing never any more to be &s;een by either Man or Woman, but to fini&s;h her days with as much mi&s;ery as &s;he found her &s;elf unhappy. In this Determination &s;he &s;py'd a Cave, which &s;he cho&s;e for her abode, eating from that time, no other Food, but wild and ill ta&s;ted Herbs; hoping by this Au&s;terity to &s;horten her Years, and &s;oon bring her life to an end.</P>
<P>Now <HI>Onoloria</HI> expected her from hour to hour, but not &s;eeing her return, was
<PB N="29" REF="21"> very much amaz'd, &s;ending a Country man to <HI>Filina,</HI> to know, what was become of her, and whence her &s;tay proceeded. The Fellow with great diligence enquir'd, as he had been commanded, all about, but could not hear any Tale or Tydings of her: wherefore he return'd to the Mona&s;tery, where being arriv'd, and having made his Report, I leave you to think, in what trouble the &s;orrowful Mother was, who will recover the Ioy, &s;he has lo&s;t, when it &s;hall plea&s;e GOD.</P>
<P>In the mean time the little <HI>Lucencio</HI> grew up from day to day, thinking him&s;elf to be Son to the good Widow <HI>Flori&s;ma,</HI> and Brother to <HI>Florindo,</HI> whom he lov'd as his &s;econd &s;elf. They were both now come to &s;uch an Age, that they were &s;trong enough to go an Hunting. Now as they &s;at &s;ometimes, during the He<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">t of the day, under the &s;hadow of the Trees, expecting the Cool of the Evening, when they might better find their Prey, <HI>Lucencio</HI> would in this manner di&s;cour&s;e his Compa|nion: <HI>Brother, there is nothing in this world, I &s;hould more de&s;ire, than if it were po&s;&s;ible, to be of the Order of Knighthood. But what? I &s;ee not any likehood of ever being &s;o: for our Father was not a Gentleman, but a Labourer, tho' a rich and hone&s;t man, nor are we noble, but Ru&s;ticks, and People of this Conditi|on are reputed unworthy to follow Arms: at which I am ready to dye for &s;pight.</HI></P>
<P>So frequent was this di&s;cour&s;e with <HI>Lucenio,</HI> that the good Widow being Ad|vertis'd thereof by <HI>Florindo,</HI> which made her from that time doubt, le&s;t coming to under&s;tand the truth of his condition, he &s;hould leave her: therefore to obviate this, &s;he us'd her utmo&s;t endeavours to conceal it from him.</P>
<P>But it happen'd one time, as he and his Companion were an Hunting, having each of them a Bow in his hand, they met an Hind, at which they &s;hot, and wounded her, yet not &s;o, but that &s;he fled through the Thickets, whether the Dogs follow'd her, &s;he doubling &s;o with them, that they came to a Fault, and a little after began again their cry, &s;o that <HI>Lucencio</HI> and <HI>Florindo,</HI> thinking they had run her down, made ha&s;t in to 'em. They perceiv'd them environing a naked Woman, who was &s;o disfigur'd, that &s;he &s;eem'd rather a Phanta&s;m, than an humane Creature, at the &s;ight of which <HI>Florindo</HI> was &s;o frighted, that he turn'd his Face, flying, and trembling like the Leaf.</P>
<P>But <HI>Lucenio,</HI> who&s;e blood could not deny the place, from whence he was de&s;cend|ed, advanc'd, and taking his Staff, drave away the Dogs from about this woman, to whom he &s;aid: <HI>By my Fathers &s;oul, I will now &s;ee whether you are an Hobgoblin, or &s;ome Devil di&s;guis'd.</HI></P>
<P>The poor Creature, wholly a&s;toni&s;ht, as thinking he would beat her, ca&s;t her &s;elf on her knees, and joyning her hands, an&s;wer'd him: <HI>Ah Gentleman, I be&s;eech you by the Faith you owe to GOD, to leave me in peace, without adding farther Afflicti|on to the Mi&s;ery, in which I have now liv'd the&s;e thirteen or fourteen years, and &s;hall live, as long as it &s;hall plea&s;e him, who has given me Being.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Lucencio,</HI> not without cau&s;e wondering to hear her &s;peak &s;o di&s;creetly, whom he ju&s;t now took for a Phanta&s;m, took a more di&s;tinct view of her, than he had hitherto done, and judg'd by the Lineaments of her Face, that &s;he mu&s;t have been heretofore
<PB N="30" REF="22"> hand&s;ome: wherefore he askt her, how &s;he came to make her Repair to this Place, inhabited only by wild and &s;avage Bea&s;ts.</P>
<P><HI>Alas!</HI> an&s;wer'd &s;he, <HI>I pray you de&s;ire not to know it: for my Misfortune is grea|ter, than you can comprehend: Wherefore I de&s;ire you to take away your Dogs, and not importune me any farther.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Lucencio</HI> had &s;uch pity of her, that he graciou&s;ly made her this Reply: <HI>Dame I will readily obey you, altho' you would have more rea&s;on, and greater joy, if leaving this Au&s;tere Life, you would come with me to my Mother, whither I will willingly conduct you for the De&s;ire, I have to &s;erve you, and all others, that would employ me.</HI></P>
<P><HI>My Child,</HI> &s;aid &s;he, <HI>I thank you; and you will do me a Plea&s;ure to tell me your Name, and who you are, to the end I may pray to our Lord, &s;o to keep you, that the Renown of your good Works may be conformable to your Beauty.</HI></P>
<P><HI>I am,</HI> an&s;wer'd he, <HI>call'd</HI> Lucencio: <HI>my Father was</HI> Sinofry, <HI>who dy'd long &s;ince, and my Mother, who yet lives, is nam'd</HI> Flori&s;ma.</P>
<P>Scarce had he utter'd this Word, but &s;he began tenderly to weep and &s;igh. And <HI>Lucencio,</HI> thinking, that the&s;e her Tears proceeded from her hearing of <HI>Sinofry</HI>'s Death, askt her, if &s;he ever knew him.</P>
<P><HI>Indeed, my Child,</HI> an&s;wer'd &s;he, <HI>I have many times &s;een your Father, and know perhaps more of your Affairs, than you do your &s;elf: &s;ince I can a&s;&s;ure you, that</HI> Si|nofry <HI>nothing concern'd you.</HI></P>

<P><HI>My Child,</HI> &s;aid &s;he, <HI>a&s;&s;ure your &s;elf, that your Father and Mother are of &s;uch noble Blood, that you are de&s;cended of an Emperor, and a King.

<ARGUMENT>
<P>How <HI>Lucencio</HI> and <HI>Florindo</HI> fled &s;ecretly from <HI>Filina</HI> to <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> where <HI>Lu|cencio</HI> receiv'd Knighthood at the hands of his Uncle, the Emperor <HI>E&s;plandian.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THe di&s;cour&s;e, which the Dam&s;el of the Forre&s;t had with <HI>Lucencio,</HI> &s;o rais'd his Heart, that he re&s;ted not an hour after without thinking, how he might attain to be a Knight. Sometimes he determin'd to &s;peak of it to his Nur&s;ing Mother <HI>Flori&s;ma;</HI> then all on a &s;uddain he chang'd his Opinion, &s;o that having debated all things in his Interiour, he re&s;olv'd as the be&s;t, to go to <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> and there humbly to &s;upplicate the Emperor <HI>E&s;plandian,</HI> of whom he had many times heard &s;peak, that he would give him the Order, with Hor&s;e and Arms, hoping, &s;eeing the Reputation, he had, to be the mo&s;t affable, and courteous Prince in the world, that he would not refu&s;e him.</P>
<P>This his Re&s;olution he imparted to <HI>Florindo,</HI> who from the time, he had told him, what was &s;aid by the Woman of the Forre&s;t, was become much more &s;erviceable to
<PB N="32" REF="23"> him, th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">n before. They began then to di&s;po&s;e the Means of their Departure; for doing <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">f which they con&s;ulted together to pick open a Coffer, in which <HI>Flori&s;ma</HI> had &s;om<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter"> Money, and take thence as much as would be nece&s;&s;ary for their Voyage: which they did, &s;o that the next day, feigning to go an Hunting according to <FIGURE>

</FIGURE> their Cu&s;tom, they &s;ecretly went aboard a Ship, which they found in the Port ready to &s;et &s;ail for <HI>Thrace,</HI> and having a good wind, &s;et forth into the Main-Sea, &s;o that in a &s;hort time they arriv'd at <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> where the Emperor <HI>E&s;plandian</HI> kept his Court, towards which <HI>Lucencio</HI> and <HI>Florindo</HI> took their Cour&s;e.</P>
<P>The Emperor was (at the time of their Arrival) in the great Hall of his Palace, attended by many Valiant Knights, all clad in mourning for the Death of the Old Emperor, and his Wife, deceas'd not long before. Clo&s;e by him was the Empre&s;s <HI>Leonorina,</HI> and her Daughter <HI>Luciana,</HI> being then about twelve Years of Age, and &s;o fair withal, and well behav'd, that &s;he was a Pearl among&s;t the <HI>Grecian</HI> Ladies. And tho' <HI>Lucencio</HI> had been all his life time bred up among&s;t Shepherds, and other Mechanical People, yet was he not amaz'd at the &s;ight of &s;o great an A&s;&s;embly, but getting near the Emperor, and making him a very low Reverence, with an a&s;&s;ured Countenance he &s;et knee to ground, and &s;pake to him in this manner: <HI>Mo&s;t Potent Prince, the Fame of your Goodne&s;s, which fills the whole World, has emboldned me to come to your Court, that I might be&s;eech you to give me the Order of
<PB N="33" REF="23"> Knighthood, with Hor&s;es, and Furniture nece&s;&s;ary; for tho' my whole E&s;tate at pre&s;ent is no more than what you may &s;ee about me, yet dare I a&s;&s;ure your Maje|&s;ty, that I am de&s;cended leneally of great Lords, nay even of Kings, as I have been told. But Fortune, who will not make all equal, has plac'd me in &s;o poor a Con|dition, that I have not &s;o much, as to procure me an Hor&s;e, unle&s;s your Maje&s;ty plea&s;e to be&s;tow one on me.</HI></P>
<P>The Emperor, &s;eeing him &s;o fair, young, and wel-demean'd, lookt on him with &s;uch an Eye, that he was mov'd to pity, and an&s;wer'd him: <HI>Truly, my Friend, I will do, what you de&s;ire me: for I believe, as far as I can gue&s;s by your Per&s;on, that Knighthood will not be ill imploy'd in you.</HI></P>
<P>And turning to the Marque&s;s <HI>Saluder,</HI> he &s;aid to him: <HI>My Lord Marque&s;s, I give you this Gentleman for a Gue&s;t, take him with you, and furni&s;h him with all, that &s;hall be nece&s;&s;ary for him&s;elf, and an E&s;quire.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Lucencio</HI> ro&s;e up, and having made his Reverence, to thank the Emperor, went along with the Marque&s;s, who the &s;ame day provided him a Suit of rich white Ar|mor, &s;uch, as was u&s;ually worn by new Knights. And altho' he had never before been &s;o accoutred, y<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">t was it &s;o fit for him, and did &s;o w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ll become him, that he &s;eem'd to have been altogether born for it That night he watcht in the Chappel with <HI>Florindo,</HI> and on the morrow the Emperor, accompany'd by the Ladies, after Divine Service was over, gave him the Order, the Infanta <HI>Luciana,</HI> to do him the more ho|nour, girding on his Sword. Then taking him by the hand, &s;he led him into the Hall, where the Tables were cover'd for Dinner.</P>
<P>But &s;carce were they entred when there pre&s;ented her &s;elf a beautiful Lady, clad in Cloth of Gold, having <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">er Hair, which was fairer than the Sun, &s;pread upon her Shoulders, and on her Head a Ga<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">land, &s;et with an infinite Number of p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ecious Stones. She ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ry'd in a Scarf a Sword and Shield, &s;o richly adorn'd with Gold and Pearls, that it was wonderful to behold; and was led under the Arms by two Knights, &s;o old and feeble, that each of them &s;eem'd above an Hundred Years of Age. By her went a Gentleman, between &s;ixteen and &s;eventeen years old, very fair, and &s;o excellently &s;hap'd, that he &s;eem'd a Ma&s;ter-piece of Nature. A little behind came two other Knights, compleatly arm'd, except the Hands, and the Head, with four Dam&s;els in very good Equi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">age.</P>
<P>Then &s;he, who appear'd to be the Lady of this Company, humbly &s;aluted the Em|peror, and making him a Reverence, endeavour'd to ki&s;s his hands, as the Gentle|man al&s;o did: but he graciou&s;ly lifted them up, asking them, if they had any Bu&s;i|ne&s;s with him.</P>
<P><HI>Sir,</HI> an&s;wer'd &s;he, <HI>Your Maje&s;ty will be pleas'd to under&s;tand, that I am Dut|che&s;s of</HI> Savoy, <HI>nam'd</HI> Grimarta, <HI>and as to this Gentleman, neither You, nor any other, can know his Name, before that be accompli&s;h'd, for which we are come forth of our Country, and with which I am now going to acquaint you. Your Maje&s;ty then may under&s;tand, that, the Duke, my Father, dying without any Heirs, but my &s;elf, I was incontinently crown'd in the City of</HI> Chambery,
<PB N="34" REF="24"> <HI>where this Gentleman was then newly arriv'd, who, vanqui&s;ht with Love of me, had le&s;t his own Countrey, hoping, after he &s;hould have &s;een me, &s;o to employ him&s;elf in &s;erving me, that his Travel and Good Will &s;hould be in &s;uch manner ac|knowledg'd by me, as he might attain to the end of his De&s;ires. And indeed, if my Fame had caus'd in him any Affection for me, 'twas little in re&s;pect of the Ar|dor, he found in him&s;elf, as &s;oon as his Eye had given him the enjoyment of my Pre&s;ence: Which Zeal was yet much more augmented, after he had begun famili|arly to di&s;cour&s;e with me.</HI></P>
<P><HI>It hapned then, that one day among&s;t the re&s;t, the Fire of this Love encrea&s;ing by little and little, as we were a hunting with a good Company of Gentlemen, La|dies, and Dam&s;els, di&s;pers'd about the Woods, &s;ome this way, others that way, I was at a certain Stand, accompany'd only by four of my Women, and two Knights, with this Gentleman. Now &s;o it was, that a chafed Bear came running &s;o furiou&s;ly towards us with open Mouth, that the two Knights, in whom lay the Safety of our Per&s;ons, were &s;o &s;righted, that they fled with all their might thro' the Fore&s;t. Your Maje&s;ty will ea&s;ily believe the Fright. I was then in: But this Gentleman, alighting from his hor&s;e, &s;hew'd him&s;elf &s;o valiant, that at the ap|proach of the Bear, who thought to lay hold of him, he gave him &s;uch a blow with his Staff between his two ears, that he fell dead to the ground. This gave me &s;uch Content, that I determin'd in my &s;elf from that very hour to love him, as he de|&s;erv'd, and not without cau&s;e, con&s;idering his Civility, the Pains, he had taken, in coming from a far Countrey, to &s;ee, and &s;erve me, and the Danger, to which he expos'd him&s;elf, for to &s;ave My Life, &s;hewing him&s;elf, tho' naked, and unarm'd, more couragious than tho&s;e two, who turn'd their backs with their Lances, and Shields.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Wherefore I began from that time forward to treat him with more intimacy, than I had done, offering him my E&s;tate, and what ever a Woman of my quality can hone&s;tly offer: Which gave him &s;o much content, that, after a thou&s;and thanks, he &s;aid to me: <HI>Madam, tho' it will be impo&s;&s;ible for me, as long as I live, to acknowledge the Favour, and Honour, you have been pleas'd, and are pleas'd to do me, I being &s;uch, as I am, and you &s;o great a Lady, and Prince&s;s; yet will I, with Prote&s;tation not to of|fend you, take the boldne&s;s to make you a farther Reque&s;t, which I mo&s;t humbly de&s;ire you to grant me, hoping, that the Effect will redound to your Glory, and my Honour. 'Tis that you will be pleas'd to give me leave to go into</HI> Great Britain <HI>to King</HI> Amadis, <HI>that I may of him at your reque&s;t receive the Order of Knighthood. This done, forasmuch as that Countrey is &s;aid to be frequented with adventurous Knights, than any other, I will for Love of you, and under the Favor of your Pre&s;ence, keep, and defend a Pa&s;&s;age, du|ring the Space of &s;ix Months, again&s;t all tho&s;e, that &s;hall attempt to pa&s;s it, on conditi|on, that, if I be vanqui&s;ht within the &s;aid time, the Conqueror &s;hall receive of you a Jew|el of &s;uch value, as you &s;hall think fit to give him; but if Fortune give me the Honour to get the better, he, or they, that &s;hall yield, &s;hall be con&s;train'd to leave their Shields in your Pavilion, with their Names in writing, for an a&s;&s;urance, that they will come, and

<P><HI>This Reque&s;t, Sir, I &s;o willingly granted him, that a few days after we &s;et forth on our journey, and for the Jewel, he &s;peak to me of, I caus'd to be brought with me this Sword, and Shield, which you &s;ee, with an Helmet, which for its Good|ne&s;s, Beauty, and Richne&s;s, is not to be valu'd. But by misfortune</HI> (&s;aid &s;he, &s;hewing one of her Women) <HI>this Gentlewoman, in who&s;e cu&s;tody it was, &s;taying behind us this morning; was met by a Knight, who askt her, for whom &s;he kept it. She an&s;wer'd him, for the be&s;t Knight in the world. Then he more di&s;cour|teous, than Gentility de&s;ires, took it from her by force, &s;aying, that, &s;ince it was dedicated to the be&s;t Knight in the world, it belong'd to none but him. And hav|ing gotten it from her again&s;t her will, he fled thro' the wood, &s;o that &s;he lo&s;t &s;ight of him: at which being greatly di&s;contented, &s;he came to us, weeping for the Out|rage, which &s;he related to us. The&s;e Knights, who accompany me, hearing it, ran to overtake him; but &s;eeing they lo&s;t their Labor in &s;earching for him, being advertiz'd, that you made your Abode in this your City, we re&s;olv'd to come, and pay you our Re&s;pects, and know, whether you would plea&s;e to command us any thing to King</HI> Amadis: <HI>with whom we had long &s;ince been, had not Fortune dri|ven us into the&s;e Coa&s;ts.</HI> This &s;aid, &s;he held her peace.</P>
<P><HI>Madam,</HI> an&s;wer'd the Emperor, <HI>You have done me both an Honour, and a Plea|&s;ure by this friendly Vi&s;it, for which I heartily thank you, and this Gentleman al|&s;o, to whom Our Lord, if he plea&s;e, grant the Grace to accompli&s;h &s;o noble an Enterpri&s;e: And as to the Villian, who has done you the Injury about your Helmet, believe me, I am very much di&s;pleas'd at it, as well that &s;o ba&s;e an Act &s;hould be done in my Countreys, as that it &s;hould be committed again&s;t a Lady of your Rank.</HI></P>
<P>During this Di&s;cour&s;e, <HI>Lucencio</HI> thought in him&s;elf, that he would go to Re|venge the Dam&s;el, and recover, what &s;he had lo&s;t: Wherefore without any farther delay he kneel'd down, and be&s;ought the Emperor, that he would give him leave &s;o to do: which he readily granted him. Then addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to the Dutche&s;s, he &s;aid to her: <HI>Madam, I have all my life heard, that Knighthood was principally ordain'd, to pre&s;erve Ladies and Gentlewomen from Injury: I entreat you there|fore command her, whom the Knight has thus wrong'd, to conduct me, till &s;uch time, as we have found him, and I promi&s;e you by the Faith, I ow the Emperor, to revenge her, and you al&s;o; or to dy in the attempt.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Truly Knight,</HI> an&s;wer'd the Dutche&s;s, <HI>I very heartily thank you:</HI> and immedi|ately commanded the Dam&s;el to accompany him, &s;aying to her: <HI>And as &s;oon as you &s;hall have recover'd the Helmet, fail not to come into</HI> Great Britain.</P>
<P>Then <HI>Lucencio,</HI> having eaten &s;omething, took hor&s;e, and accompany'd only by <HI>Florindo,</HI> who &s;erv'd him for an E&s;quire, and the Dam&s;el, departed out of the City,

Now there were many upon the Shore, looking after her at her departure when a Knight, compleatly arm'd, except his Head and his Hands, entred the Palace, and &s;aluting the Emperor, was known to be <HI>Sergil.

<P><HI>Sir,</HI> an&s;wer'd he, <HI>He humbly recommends him&s;elf to your good Grace, and has &s;ent me expre&s;ly to acquaint you, that one &s;ole Knight has valiantly conquer'd the</HI> Defended Mountain, <HI>fought with, and vanqui&s;ht</HI> Belleris, Frandalon, <HI>and</HI> Fran|dalo, <HI>&s;o that he, and the King of</HI> Ieru&s;alem, <HI>are become Ma&s;ters of the Fortre&s;s, as we are certainly inform'd by two Souldiers of the Garri&s;on, who have made their E&s;cape to</HI> Te&s;ifanto. <HI>May it plea&s;e you therefore, Sir, to advi&s;e, how you will have King</HI> Norandel <HI>govern him&s;elf in this Affair, and to con&s;ider the importance of the Place, ea&s;y to be regain'd before the</HI> Turks <HI>&s;end Succour thither, if you pre|vent them.</HI></P>
<P><HI>How?</HI> reply'd the Emperor: <HI>Is it po&s;&s;ible, that one only Knight has done &s;o many Feats of Arms, as you &s;ay? And are my People all dead?</HI></P>
<P><HI>No, Sir,</HI> &s;aid he: <HI>But never Knights better did their Devoir, tho' they were in fine vanqui&s;ht, and left without means to defend them&s;eves.</HI></P>
<P><HI>GOD be prais'd for all,</HI> an&s;wer'd the Emperor: <HI>We mu&s;t endeavour to provide for it.</HI></P>
<P>Then he call'd the Prince of <HI>Brandalia,</HI> and the Marque&s;s <HI>Saluder;</HI> to whom he gave Order for the Equipping, and Arming all the Ve&s;&s;els, they could a&s;&s;emble, with Souldiers, and other Per&s;ons nece&s;&s;ary for the Voyage.

<P><HI>Ha!</HI> &s;aid <HI>Lucencio</HI> then to the Dam&s;el, <HI>Never tru&s;t me, if there ben't your man; I pray you fair Lady, go no farther le&s;t he know you, for if it be he, 'tis to be fear'd, he will flye to &s;ave his Theft: keep your &s;elf therefore conceal'd with my E&s;quire, till I have &s;poken with him.</HI></P>
<P>Having &s;aid this, he rode on a great Gallop, and being come near to tho&s;e that were &s;ighting, they &s;tood &s;till, to know, what he lookt for. But <HI>Lucencio,</HI> ea&s;ily knowing the Knight, he &s;ought for, by the Marks, that had been given him, cry'd out to him: <HI>Ill-bred Knight, who robbe&s;t travelling Dam&s;els, re&s;tore the Helmet, or thou &s;halt dy an evil Death.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The Helmet?</HI> an&s;wer'd the other, <HI>It belongs &s;o ju&s;tly to me, that you &s;hall ne|ver have it, &s;eeing it is mine.</HI></P>
<P><HI>In faith,</HI> &s;aid he, with whom he fought, <HI>neither he, nor you, de&s;erve it; but I a|lone, who have &s;et my &s;elf to gain it by force of Arms, be&s;ides, &s;he who carry'd it, &s;aid, it was for the be&s;t Knight in the world. Now neither of you are any way equal to me: wherefore I advi&s;e you to follow your way, and, without contending any farther, to do me Ju&s;tice of your &s;elves; el&s;e my Sword &s;hall do it me to your Di&s;grace and Damage.</HI></P>
<P><HI>On my word,</HI> an&s;wer'd <HI>Lucencio, you both &s;ufficiently &s;hew your Follies: But tell me in good earne&s;t, for what Rea&s;on the Dam&s;el &s;hould lo&s;e it, from whom it was taken by violence. Come, come, leave this Quarrel, and re&s;tore it wil|lingly to her; otherwi&s;e I will endeavour to make you do it by force.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Truly Knight,</HI> reply'd he, that took it, <HI>I no longer wonder at your being &s;o lean, &s;ince you trouble your &s;elf about &s;o many things.

<P><HI>I promi&s;e you,</HI> an&s;wer'd the fir&s;t.</P>
<P>By this word <HI>Lucencio</HI> well knew, that 'twas at him, their Di&s;cour&s;e was le|vell'd: wherefore he retir'd a little back, the better to give his hor&s;e a Career, and couching his Lance, ran &s;o directly upon them, that he met him of the Helmet w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">th &s;uch force, that, his Staff breaking in pieces, he tumbled him on the ground; yet he held fa&s;t the Reins of his Steed, and &s;oon after got up again. In the mean time <HI>Lucencio</HI> turn'd his Bridle, and &s;etting his hand to his Sword there began &s;o &s;harp and dangerous a fight of two again&s;t one, that <HI>Lucencio</HI> pre&s;ently knew the Peril, he &s;hould be in, if he did not look the better about him. Then altho' he had never been at &s;uch &s;port before, mov'd neverthele&s;s with a natural In&s;tinct to imitate tho&s;e of whom he was de&s;cended, he had &s;o good and vertuous an Heart, that his Adver|&s;aries &s;oon perceiv'd it, the Field being in many places dy'd with their Blood. But our Game&s;ter was pretty well matcht: for the two A&s;&s;ailants treated him &s;o ill, that he felt him&s;elf &s;o wounded, as to doubt of his Death: at which he became &s;o furious that he entred pell mell betwixt them, iu&s;t as a chafed Bull does among&s;t tho&s;e, who provoke him in the Place, where he is to be baited. And thus &s;triking on the right hand, and on the left, he met, not with the Knight, that had robb'd the Dam&s;el, but the other, whom he gave &s;uch a Blow on the ear with the Pommel of his Sword, that it made him bow his Head as low as his Saddle-bow, and, before he could recover him&s;elf, <HI>Lucencio,</HI> redoubling his Stroke, with the edge of his Sword &s;mote his Head from his Shoulders. his Body falling reaking to the ground. Of which <HI>Lu|cencio</HI> glad, cry'd out loud enough: <HI>In good faith, Ma&s;ter, you will now have no more need of a Night-cap, much le&s;s of the Helmet, you &s;o greatly de&s;ir'd.</HI></P>
<P>When the other &s;aw his Companion in &s;o ill a Condition, he no longer de&s;ir'd to try the Force of him, he had injur'd: the better therefore to &s;ecure him&s;elf, feign|ing to revenge his Fellow, he drew near, and lifting up his Arm, gave <HI>Lucencio's</HI> Hor&s;e &s;uch a Blow with his Sword between the two Ears, that he kill'd him: then giving his own Hor&s;e the Reins, he turn'd his Back, flying, as if a thou&s;and De|vils were at his heels. You may ea&s;ily believe, that <HI>Lucencio</HI> was not a little di&s;|pleas'd: for he &s;aw him&s;elf without an Hor&s;e, and out of hopes as it were to recover what he &s;ought, which was the Helmet, that the other carry'd away. But when he was got up, &s;pying the dead Knights Steed pa&s;s by, he found means to &s;ei&s;e of him, and getting on his back, po&s;ted after him, that was fled.</P>
<P>Then <HI>Florindo</HI> and the Dam&s;el, who had kept them&s;elves conceal'd within the Forre&s;t, &s;eeing him thus &s;peed away, came out of their ambu&s;h to follow him: but they lo&s;t &s;ight of him, and it was almo&s;t Night, when they &s;aw him again on the top of an Hill, whence he di&s;cover'd his Man, making &s;uch ha&s;t down, that his Hor&s;e be|ing tir'd, and out of breath, he took &s;o great a Leap along the Valley, that he roll'd above a Stones ca&s;t, before he &s;topt, in &s;uch manner that <HI>Lucencio</HI> could not forbear laughing: for he thought, the Hor&s;e had broken his own Neck, and his Ma&s;ters too. Neverthele&s;s they both got up again, and in the mean time <HI>Lucencio</HI> approacht, cry|ing out a loud: <HI>By my Faith, Sir Knight, you &s;hall now leave the Helmet, which is none of yours, and your Head likewi&s;e.</HI></P>
<PB N="40" REF="27">
<P>The other, &s;eeing him &s;o clo&s;e at his heels, thought no way better to &s;ecure his life, than to throw down, what he had, hoping that <HI>Lucencio,</HI> in&s;tead of pur&s;uing him, would amu&s;e him&s;elf in taking it up. But he, not regarding it, pa&s;s'd on w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">th &s;uch &s;peed, that he overtook him near a great Wood, and gave him &s;uch a blow on the bare head, as cleft it down to his teeth. Then he turn'd back to the Place, where he &s;aw the Knight throw down the Helmet, but he found it not there: Where|fore he thought that <HI>Florindo</HI> and the Dam&s;el had taken it up: And for this cau&s;e he lookt round about to &s;ee, whether he could e&s;py them; but it was in vain. At which being much troubled, he return'd to the top of the Hill, and entring thence into the Forre&s;t, re&s;olv'd to &s;tay there till morning: for the Darkne&s;s was by this time &s;o great, that he could not &s;ee which way to go.</P>
<P>By and by, he heard an hor&s;e neigh, and thinking it might be tho&s;e he lookt for, he rode thither, where by the light of a great Fire he perceiv'd a very fair and young Lady, wa&s;hing her hands in a Fountain, which &s;prang forth of an hollow Rock clo&s;e by. Se was attended by &s;ix others, having each of them on their Heads Garlands and Chaplets of very odoriferous Flowers, two of which joyning their Voices to the Sound of the Lutes, which they &s;weetly toucht, made the Air &s;ound with &s;uch a Harmony, that <HI>Lucencio</HI> became wholly a&s;toni&s;ht, &s;urpris d neverthele&s;s with &s;ome Ardor of Love, which &s;o enflam'd his heart, that he approacht them, and &s;aluting the Company, addre&s;t him&s;elf to the faire&s;t of them, to whom he &s;aid: <HI>Madam, I be&s;eech you to excu&s;e my Pre&s;umption towa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ds you, a&s;&s;uring you, that my Com|ing to this Place is not to di&s;turb you; but rather to &s;erve you, if you plea&s;e to command me any thing.</HI></P>
<P>At this Di&s;cour&s;e &s;he, who thought only of refre&s;hing her &s;elf, lifted up her head, and &s;eeing him all Arm'd, except his Helmet, which he carry'd at his Saddle-Bow, was at fir&s;t amaz'd; but his Demeanor, appear'd &s;o gentle, that &s;he rea&s;&s;ur'd her &s;elf, ing him what he &s;ought.</P>
<P><HI>Madam,</HI> an&s;wer'd he, <HI>I was looking for an E&s;quire of mine, and a Dam&s;el, whom he accompanys: but Love, I think, has directed me to the Light of this Fire, to make me experiment the heat of a &s;everer, with which I already feel my &s;elf in|flam'd; yet your great Beauty and Excellence, which have kindled it in my heart, have al&s;o the means to moderate it, if you plea&s;e to take pity of me, who never of|fended you, as I know of.</HI></P>
<P>The Lady, hearing him &s;peak with &s;uch affection, could not forbear &s;miling, and feigning not to under&s;tand this Language of Love, turn'd the Cart again&s;t the hor&s;e, &s;aying to him: <HI>And how did your People lo&s;e you thus?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Madam,</HI> an&s;wer'd <HI>Lucencio, as I was going after a Knight, who had forcibly ta|ken an Helmet from the Dam&s;el, I &s;peak of my E&s;quire and &s;he, who follow'd me at a Di&s;tance, were &s;urpriz'd by the night, and I expected to meet with them in this wood, but I find my &s;elf much mi&s;taken: for thinking to recover another I have lo&s;t my &s;elf by the Extremity of that Divine Beauty, with which you are endued.</HI> Then he related to her from point to point all, that you have heard of the Helmet, an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter"> what had befaln &s;ince.</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P>How the Emperor <HI>E&s;plandian</HI> arriv'd at the <HI>Defended Mountain,</HI> where he fought with the <HI>Knight of the Burning Sword:</HI> and what was the I&s;&s;ue of their Combat.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THe <HI>Knight of the Burning Sword</HI> continu'd in the Ca&s;tle of the <HI>Defended Moun|tain</HI> above three weeks after the Victory, he had gotten over tho&s;e, that guard|ed it: during which, there pa&s;s'd not a Day, but he went to vi&s;it <HI>Frandalo,</HI> and the other wounded Knights, till &s;uch time as <HI>Yneril</HI> return'd from <HI>Natolia</HI> with a Reinforcement of twenty <HI>Turks,</HI> who were very well receiv'd, e&s;pecially by the King of <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> who had before related to the <HI>Knight of the Burning Sword</HI> the manner, how he was taken at the Siege of <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> as his Son and Daugh|ter were a little before by <HI>Perion</HI> of <HI>Gaul,</HI> then Surnam'd the <HI>Knight of the Sphere.</HI></P>
<P><HI>But believe me,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>never was captive Prince more honour'd, or better treated, or had &s;o many Civilities &s;hewn him, as I receiv'd from King</HI> Amadis, <HI>and the Emperor</HI> E&s;plandian.</P>
<P>Then he related at large the Favours, and Courte&s;ies, that had been done him, which were &s;o many, that the <HI>Knight of the Burning Sword</HI> &s;aid aloud: <HI>Truly I mu&s;t even from your Di&s;cour&s;e confe&s;s, that Vertue and Prowe&s;s are more familiar to</HI> Amadis <HI>and his Children, than to any other Knights in the World.</HI></P>
<P>As they di&s;cours'd thus, leaning on a Window, that lookt towards the Sea, they perceiv'd a Bark with two Oars come into the Harbour, out of which landed a Knight, arm'd in black Armor, all but his Head, an E&s;quire bearing his Helmet, and a Dam&s;el his Shield, on the mid&s;t of which in a Field <HI>Or</HI> was painted a Cro&s;s, red as blood. They began to a&s;cend the Steps, cut in the Rock, &s;o that in a little time they were come to the Portal, where the Knight made him&s;elf ready to fight. Which being &s;een by him <HI>of the Burning Sword,</HI> who beheld him come &s;o boldly up, he knew not at fir&s;t what to think of him; but it came at la&s;t into his mind, that he was indeed &s;ome <HI>Chri&s;tian,</HI> who, having under&s;tood the Lo&s;s of the Ca&s;tle, would en|deavour to recover it, if he could. And for this Rea&s;on he askt him out of the Win|dow, whither he was going, and what he &s;ought: <HI>For,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>the Bla&s;on of that Shield you bear, te&s;tifies that you can be no other than an Enemy to the</HI> Turks.</P>
<P>At this word the black Knight lifted up his Eyes, and &s;eeing him, that que&s;tion'd him, thought him the faire&s;t Per&s;onage, he had ever beheld: wherefore he an&s;wer'd him: <HI>In good faith Knight, if you are he that have gain'd this Ca&s;tle by force of Arms, Knighthood indeed (con&s;idering your young Age, and what your Counte|nance &s;hews) is better employ'd in you, than in any other, I know; and if your
<PB N="43" REF="28"> Conditions are &s;uch as Fame reports them, you ought not to take it ill, that (bea|ring the Sign, which is in my Shield) I endeavour to do what you have done, de|&s;iring to prove my &s;elf again&s;t you, as again&s;t the mo&s;t courteous, and valiant Knight of</HI> A&s;ia. <HI>I de&s;ire you then to cau&s;e the Gate to be open'd for me: For, on the Security of your word, I will come in, and we will try (if you will take my ad|vice) which of us two Fortune will mo&s;t favour in fight.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Knight of the Burning Sword</HI> ea&s;ily imagin'd by the Di&s;cour&s;e of the other, that he mu&s;t be &s;ome valiant Man. And for that rea&s;on he &s;aid to him: <HI>Indeed, Knight, you &s;peak &s;o much to my advantage, that I greatly doubt, whether I ought to a&s;&s;ure you that I am he, you imagin, or another. One certainty there is, that Honour always redounds to him, from whom it parts: thus you cannot but gain Honour by the Combat, you demand, whether you have the better, or the wor&s;e. For to prai&s;e the Strength, and Vertues of ones Enemy is nothing el&s;e, but to il|lu&s;trate ones &s;elf, and to de&s;ire to conquer his Heart by Virtue, before one attempt his Body by Force. And therefore, &s;ince you are come to hazard your life, and to endeavour the gaining of Renown by doing what your Law obliges you to, it would neither be rea&s;onable, nor courteous in me to deny you, what you de&s;ire of me. S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ay then a little, and I will cau&s;e you to be let in on the Condition, you re|que&s;t, and which I willingly grant you.</HI></P>
<P>Then he retir'd from the Window, leaving the black Knight extremely &s;atisfy'd with the Civility of his Di&s;cour&s;e. But he &s;taid not long before the Gate was o|pen'd, at the entrance of which a portly Knight pre&s;ented him&s;elf, arm'd with white Armor, and having about his Neck a Shield, on which was painted a Red Sword, with &s;ome Characters, that he could not under&s;tand: neverthele&s;s he doubt|ed much, that it was he, who had &s;poken to him at the Window, and with whom he de&s;ir'd to fight: for he bad him enter, and then endeavour to accompli&s;h that for which he was come.</P>
<P>At this word the black Knight pa&s;s'd on, and, as he entred, &s;aid to the other: <HI>I pray you good Sir, let our Combat be farther in the inner Court of the Ca&s;tle.</HI> This he &s;aid, fearing, le&s;t (if he &s;hould vanqui&s;h) the Door might be &s;hut again&s;t him.</P>
<P>The <HI>Knight of the Burning Sword,</HI> very well knowing what he meant, an|&s;wer'd him, that he was well pleas'd, it &s;hould be &s;o, and offering him the Honour of the way, importun'd him to go in fir&s;t: but the black Knight re|fus'd it, telling him, that He, who was Lord of the Place, ought to &s;hew him the way.</P>
<P><HI>I will obey you then,</HI> an&s;wer'd the other: <HI>for it may be thinking to &s;hew my &s;elf too courteous towards you, I may fail in not doing, what you de&s;ire: I have al&s;o all my life heard &s;ay, that Knights, who are upon the point to combat, ought to have Courte&s;ie in no le&s;s e&s;teem, than Honour u&s;ing towards each other humble and gracious Di&s;cour&s;es, remitting all the Ill Will, they may bear one another, to the Strength of their Arms, guided by the Magnanimity of their hearts, in expecta|tion
<PB N="44" REF="29"> of the future Victory: which if they obtain, it is &s;o much the more glorious, as their Di&s;cour&s;e was more courteous and affable, than the Place and Occa&s;ion requi|red.</HI></P>
<P>Then he pa&s;s'd on, and the black Knight after him, who, before they began the Combat, &s;aid to him: <HI>Knight, if thou would&s;t leave thy fooli&s;h Belief, and follow me to a Place, where thy Strength and Courage would be better employ'd for his Glory and Honour, of whom thou ha&s;t receiv'd them, believe me, I would ea&s;ily forbear this Conte&s;t, not for any doubt, I have of thee; but only to the end we might be Friends, &s;o much do <HI>I</HI> commend and e&s;teem thee.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Ah!</HI> an&s;wer'd the other, <HI>This Reque&s;t is &s;o much out of Rea&s;on, that <HI>I</HI> ought by no means to di&s;pute it with thee.

<P><HI>Is it &s;o?</HI> &s;aid he in the black Arms: <HI>Come on then.</HI> And uttering this word, they charg'd one another with &s;uch vigor, that there was never &s;een a fiercer Fight: for during the &s;pace of above two long hours, they ceas'd not to cut and thru&s;t, unjoin|ting each others Armor, and paring their Shields in &s;uch manner, that the Place was up and down cover'd with the Pieces which flew from them, &s;o that it could not be judg'd, to which of them the Victory was promis'd: for the longer they fought, the more eager they &s;eem'd to be: whence it hapned, that they were by the heat of the Sun (it being now Noon) &s;o &s;calded in their Harne&s;s, that they were forc'd to draw back, and lift up the Vi&s;ors of their Helmets to take breath. But this la&s;ted not long, ere they charg'd again with more Fury, than before; yet could not either of them gain any advantage over the other: at which being extremely vext within them&s;elves, they let go their Swords, leaving them hanging at their wri&s;ts in Sil|ver Chains, and clo&s;ing, endeavour'd each by his &s;trength and skill in wre&s;tling to throw his Adver&s;ary on the ground: which 'twas impo&s;&s;ible for them to do, both of them &s;tanding &s;o &s;tifly, that the King of <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> running to <HI>Frandalo,</HI> who&s;e weakne&s;s caus'd him to keep his Chamber, &s;aid to him: <HI>If you can but come into the&s;e Galleries, you will &s;ee (perhaps) the cruel&s;t Fight, that can po&s;&s;ibly be be|ween two per&s;ons.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Frandalo</HI> wondring what it might be, made a &s;hift to crawl thit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">er, and came ju&s;t as they were falling one upon the other, yet without any way letting go their hold. Then they &s;trove, who &s;hould get the advantage; but in vain: for one was no &s;oo|ner got uppermo&s;t, but he pre&s;ently found him&s;elf again underneath. Thus &s;trug|ling, &s;ometimes above, &s;ometimes under, they grew &s;o out of breath, that they &s;e|parated, and ri&s;ing up, took their Swords again, with which they acted &s;o valiantly as if they had not &s;triken a &s;troke all that day before. Which made <HI>Frandalo</HI> to who the King of <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> had related all the beginning of this Di&s;pute, conjecture that he in the black Arms was <HI>Amadis</HI> of <HI>Gaul.</HI> But he &s;oon chang'd this Opinion: for <HI>Amadis</HI> was indeed of le&s;s Stature, and in too far a Countrey: wherefore he &s;u&s;|pected that it was rather <HI>Li&s;vart</HI> of <HI>Greece,</HI> who had made this attempt. And was &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ying &s;o to the King of <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> as the Knight in the black Arms, lifting up his
<PB N="45" REF="29"> head, &s;py'd <HI>Frandalo,</HI> at which he was both Glad and Sorry. Glad to &s;ee him alive, and Sorry that his Colour was pale and wan, which was caus'd by the continual Pain, he &s;uffer'd in his wounds. This made the black Knight &s;o much de&s;ire to re|venge him that f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">etting in him&s;elf for having been already &s;o long about it, he could not forbear &s;aying between his Teeth: <HI>By my Head, I have been too long fighting for &s;o de&s;ir'd a Victory, and I mu&s;t &s;urely believe, that this is &s;ome Devil let loo&s;e from the Bottom of Hell: for if he were other, I &s;hould long &s;ince have brought him <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 word"> rea&s;on.</HI></P>
<P>And at that in&s;tant his Courage intrea&s;t in &s;uch manner, that he &s;truck him in the white Arms &s;o outrageou&s;ly, that he forc'd him to &s;et knee to ground: yet he got &s;uddenly up again, and the better to be quit with his Adver&s;ary, took his Sword in both hands, with which he gave him &s;o &s;trong a blow, that had it not me<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter"> with the Shield, which he oppos'd again&s;t it, 'twould have been his la&s;t: neve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="2 letters">hele&s;s the Point fell upon his Helmet, and &s;o &s;tunny'd him, that he was con&s;train'd to lean a|gain&s;t the wall, or el&s;e he had tumbled on the ground. But this A&s;toni&s;hment la&s;ted but a little, ere they made a fre&s;h charge with more violence, than before; tho' indeed the black Knight began vi&s;ibly, to grow faint and heavy, however he &s;till vigorou&s;ly per|form'd <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="2 letters">s Devoir: yet was it ea&s;ily di&s;cern'd that he could not long hold out. Wherefore he in the white Armor drew a little back, and &s;aid to him: <HI>Knight, be not thine own Murtherer; but yield: for it were great Pity thou &s;hould&s;t dye, be|ing &s;o valiant a man, as <HI>I</HI> know thee to be.</HI></P>
<P><HI>In good faith,</HI> an&s;wer'd the other, <HI>thy Courte&s;y &s;ummons me as it were to fol|low thy Coun&s;el; but my Honour contradicts it, &s;o that nothing but Death &s;hall fini&s;h this Di&s;pute between us two.</HI></P>
<P>And altho' he had not then &s;o much Shield left, as would cover his Arm, and tho his Helmet, and Armor were unrive<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ted and broken, &s;o that his bare Fle&s;h ap|pear'd in many places, yet as he an&s;wer'd his Antagoni&s;t, he entred into &s;uch a Fury that &s;tepping forward, he gave him &s;uch a blow with his Sword upon the Shoulder-piece, that the Blood in that place dy'd his Harne&s;s. This exceedingly in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="2 letters">n&s;t the white Knight, who was about to make him very &s;en&s;ible of his Re&s;entment, when a Servant came running to tell the King of <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> that there was a Dam&s;el at the Gate, who de&s;ir'd to be let in for a matter, which greatly imported the two Com|batants. The King commanded her to be immediately brought in, and &s;he in&s;tantly pre&s;ented her &s;elf before the Knights, to whom &s;he &s;aid: <HI>My Lords, I be&s;eech you, if you plea&s;e, to delay your Fight, and hear the Me&s;&s;age I have to deliver to you.</HI></P>
<P>At this word they drew back, principally he in the Black Arms, who knew her for it was <HI>Alqui&s;a,</HI> who, &s;ince the Lo&s;s of <HI>Li&s;vart</HI> and <HI>Perion,</HI> had kept company with <HI>Urganda</HI> in the <HI>I&s;le of Apes,</HI> and was by h r Father &s;ent towards the two Knights, to prevent their death which was very near, if their wrath had continu'd as it was begun. To obviate which, &s;he pro&s;trated her &s;elf at the Feet of him in the Black Arms, &s;peaking to him in this manner: <HI>Sir, my father, who loves and e&s;teems you, commanded me to do you this Honour, a&s;&s;uring me that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 span"> fir&s;t

<P><HI>Dam&s;el,</HI> an&s;wer'd he, <HI>if you know me not at pre&s;ent, I know very well, who you are, we having often di&s;cours'd together at a more agreeable time.

<P><HI>It &s;hall not &s;tick there,</HI> &s;aid the Dam&s;el. Then turning her Face towards him in the white Arms, &s;he &s;aid to him: <HI>Knight, the Old Man, who found you in the Forre&s;t, after you had deliver'd King</HI> Magadan, <HI>de&s;ires you for a rea&s;on to fight no more again&s;t him, to whom I have addre&s;t my &s;elf, but to remember the Di&s;|cour&s;e you had with him, when you &s;aid, that <HI>Vertue was never lo&s;t, in what place &s;oever it were exercis'd.</HI></HI></P>

<P>Now he had taken notice of the Honour, &s;he did the black Knight, which made him conjecture, that he was &s;ome King, or other great Per&s;onage, wherefore he &s;aid to him: <HI>My Lord, pardon me, I be&s;eech you, if in my Behaviour and Words I have not been &s;o courteous to you as I ought, and do me the Favour to tell me, who you are, that I may hereafter better know by name, him, in whom there is &s;o much Goodne&s;s and Prowe&s;s.</HI></P>

<P><HI>O</HI> Iupiter, cry'd out the <HI>Knight of the Burning Sword, is it po&s;&s;ible, that the Prince who&s;e Renown is the greate&s;t, and mo&s;t glorious of any in the whole world, has done me this Honour!

<P>Now he believ'd her to be &s;till behind him; but &s;he was already departed, which he perceiv'd, as he thought to give her thanks: wherefore with much di&s;content he chang'd his di&s;cour&s;e, and askt, what way &s;he had taken.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>FRandalo,</HI> who was come down out of the Galleries, to li&s;ten to the Dam&s;els di&s;|cour&s;e, having heard from the Emperor <HI>E&s;plandians</HI> own mouth, that it was he who had fought with the <HI>Knight of the Burning Sword,</HI> pre&s;ently kneel'd down to ki&s;s his Hands, the King of <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> al&s;o making him a very great Reverence. The Emperor receiv'd them very kindly, and embracing the King, &s;aid to him: <HI>In good faith, Brother, your Liberty is, I believe, more happy than you expected, be|ing deliver'd, and freed out of Pri&s;on by the be&s;t Knight I ever &s;aw in my life.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Ah Sir,</HI> &s;aid <HI>Frandalo, your Pre&s;ence gives me an incomparable Joy, and a Re|gret even to Death,</HI></P>
<P><HI>My good Friend,</HI> &s;aid the Emperor, <HI>you have always be e&s;teem'd &s;o di&s;creet, that you need not any Comfort, but what you can give your &s;elf.</HI></P>
<P>But they had not long continu'd this Di&s;cour&s;e, when the twenty <HI>Turks</HI> lately arriv'd for Defence of the Place, calling out to Arms, ran upon the Emperor: who, more a&s;toni&s;ht than before, and that not without cau&s;e, &s;aid to the King of <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> whom he &s;u&s;pected to be the Head of this Trea&s;on: <HI>How, Brother, Dare you in|deed do an Act, &s;o injurious to your Honour, and the Right of Chivalry?

<PB N="48" REF="31"> Gentlemen for you cannot be ignorant, that I entred into this place with Security from him, who had power to give me it.</HI></P>
<P>The King of <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> very &s;orry for this a&s;&s;ault, took &s;uddenly his Sword in hand, and &s;everely menac'd the&s;e Ra&s;cals: who, to &s;hew how little they would do for him, began in &s;uch manner to let fly their Arrows, that they &s;eem'd like Hail, pouring down from Heaven. This &s;o chaf'd the Emperor, that without any farther delay, he cover'd him&s;elf with his Shield, and with Sword in hand entred pell mell among&s;t them, &s;triking &s;o on the right and left, that he gave the fir&s;t, he met with, &s;uch a blow, that he never &s;pake after, and following the re&s;t, brought three of them with their No&s;es to the ground. Neverthele&s;s this could not have pre&s;erv'd him without <HI>Frandalo,</HI> who, weak and feeble as he was, got hold of a Battle ax, and follow'd by two of his Squires, &s;o well &s;econded the Emperor, that whether the o|thers would or no, they were forc'd to give back, to their great &s;hame and lo&s;s. And as we often &s;ee a campany of Pies per&s;ue an Hawk, that, taking his flight from off his Ma&s;ters hand, pearches upon &s;ome Tree, at his departure from which being pro|vok'd by their beating and pecking at him, he not only &s;eizes upon one, two, or three of them, but furiou&s;ly &s;catters the Remainder: in the like manner the&s;e Ra&s;cals, having done their endeavour again&s;t the Emperor, betook them&s;elves to flight, &s;ome falling dead, and others putting all their hopes in the entrance of a &s;tair ca&s;e, whe|ther they retir'd for their Defence. But this weak Re&s;i&s;tance la&s;ted &s;carce a moment, the Emperor and <HI>Frandalo</HI> following them &s;o clo&s;e, that there did not one of them e&s;cape.</P>
<P>The King of <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> was then in very great perplexity, fearing, le&s;t the Em|peror might impute it to him, that he had been the Author of &s;o great a Villany: of which being de&s;irous to excu&s;e him&s;elf, before he was &s;poken to about it, he went to meet the Emperor, and &s;aid to him: <HI>Sir, I humbly be&s;e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ch you to b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">lieve, that the Trea&s;on of the&s;e Rogues was not in the lea&s;t known to me, nor yet to the</HI> Knight of the Burning Sword: <HI>as</HI> Frandalo <HI>can al&s;o a&s;&s;ure you, with what Civility he has been treated &s;ince the Conque&s;t of this Place.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Truly,</HI> an&s;wer'd the Emperor, <HI>the&s;e Wretches have &s;ufficiently &s;hewn, how little they know to maintain the Fidelity, requi&s;ite among&s;t Knights, and they have al|&s;o been very well recompens'd, and cha&s;tis'd for it. And as to you, King of</HI> Ieru|&s;alem, <HI>I certainly believe what you affirm, and farther to &s;atisfy you, <HI>I</HI> do &s;o, <HI>I</HI> will not hinder your departure, whither, and when you plea&s;e, out of this Place, which (as you know) <HI>I</HI> have conquer'd twice with the Price of my Blood. And this makes me the more de&s;irous to keep it better, than ever <HI>I</HI> have done, nor can &s;o doing any way blemi&s;h my Honour, I being no more oblig'd to keep Faith with tho&s;e here, than they have been ready to do it with me. So that &s;eeing the wicked and ba&s;e Act of the&s;e Ra&s;cals, which a&s;&s;aulted me, and the Su&s;picion al&s;o, that may be ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter"> of you, who are of their Religion, if <HI>I</HI> &s;hew you now any Courte&s;ie and Ci|vility, you ought to thank the Kn<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ght that is gone; and none el&s;e.</HI></P>
<P>At the fini&s;hing their Di&s;cour&s;e, they entred into the great Hall, which lookt to|wards
<PB N="49" REF="31"> the Sea, where the King of <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> di&s;cover'd a va&s;t Fleet of Ships, and other warlike Equipage, which <HI>E&s;plandian</HI> had brought for Recovery of that Place: But would, before he laid Siege to it, endeavour to regain it by the means you have heard: for which purpo&s;e he went into a Skiff, taking no other Company with him, but one E&s;quire, and <HI>Carmella,</HI> who &s;taid for him at the Gate, into which &s;he en|tred, when &s;he perceiv'd the <HI>Knight of the Burning Sword</HI> go out.

<P><HI>Ah! Sir,</HI> an&s;wer d King <HI>Norandel, how then have you lo&s;t him &s;o &s;oon? cer|tainly your Court would have been much honour'd, if you had &s;taid him for yours.</HI></P>

<P>Thus did the Emperor di&s;cour&s;e of him, who&s;e Grand-father he was, tho' not knowing it: and &s;o long did he continue in the <HI>Defend<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">d Mountain,</HI> till his wounds were at la&s;t quite cur'd.

<P>Ah vertuous Knight, <HI>an&s;wer'd &s;he,</HI> you have &s;poken &s;o well, that I &s;hall e&s;teem you for it, as long as <HI>I</HI> live.

But as one Unhappi|ne&s;s often accompanies another, King <HI>Alpatracy</HI> and his Queen living peaceably in their Countrey, ble&s;t with one only Daughter, which GOD had given them, more divinely accompli&s;ht in all Perfections, than any other Creature in the world, it happen'd that the King of <HI>Metz</HI> died, by who&s;e Death <HI>Miramynia,</HI> his &s;ole Daugh|ter and Heire&s;s, became Queen and Lady of his Countreys, which are large and rich, as having been given for Apennage to a &s;econd Son of <HI>France:</HI> for from <HI>Pha|ramond,</HI> who fir&s;t took the Title of King over the <HI>French,</HI> de&s;cended, as I have many times heard, <HI>Claudius</HI> and <HI>Meroveus.</HI> This <HI>Meroveus</HI> had three legitimate Sons, who, when their Father was dead, divided this great Monarchy betwixt them, &s;o that the Kingdom of <HI>Metz</HI> came to the &s;econd, who was Father of the Queen, that is VVife to this Knight. And for this rea&s;on he was &s;ometimes nam'd, and entitled King of <HI>Metz</HI> in <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P>Now it is not long &s;ince <HI>Alpatracy</HI> took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it, and receiv'd an Oath of Fidelity from all his Subjects. But as he was returning into <HI>Sicily,</HI> he had News, that a near Relation of the Queens was revolted, and had taken by &s;urprize the principal Towns of the Realm, under color of a certain pretended Law, e&s;tabli&s;ht and ordain'd, as they &s;ay, by the &s;aid <HI>Pharamond,</HI> by which the Traytor affirms, that the Realm of <HI>France</HI> mu&s;t never fall to the Di&s;taff, and that the Kingdom of <HI>Metz</HI> is &s;ubject al&s;o to the &s;ame Statute, as being a Member and Part of the <HI>French</HI> Monarchy.</P>
<P>This News was as plea&s;ing to the King, as you may imagin it to be; yet he hop'd to avenge him&s;elf throughly on the Traytor, which he would ea&s;ily have done, had not a &s;econd and wor&s;e Misfortune diverted him. VVhich was, that the Queen <HI>Miramynia,</HI> and her Daughter, as they were hunting in the Forre&s;t, near <HI>Sara|go&s;&s;a,</HI> were &s;urpris'd by <HI>Frandalon</HI> the <HI>Cyclops,</HI> and his Son, two horrible and mercile&s;s Gyants, who mauger the Hunt&s;men and others, &s;ent away the two La|dies Pri&s;oners into the I&s;le of <HI>Silanchy,</HI> where they are yet at pre&s;ent. And the&s;e Devils have &s;ent word to the King, that he &s;hall never recover them, unle&s;s he come with another, and fight with them concerning the Right, they pretend to the Realm and Countrey of <HI>Sicily,</HI> which, they &s;ay, belongs to them, as having
<PB N="53" REF="33"> been at fir&s;t peopled, and inhabited by their Ance&s;tors: and if they &s;hall be van|qui&s;ht, they will re&s;tore the Ladies: but if the King and his Second, &s;hall have the wor&s;t, he &s;hall be con&s;train'd, and oblig'd by Oath, to &s;urrender into their hands the Countrey, they claim, to be enjoy'd by them, as their own, without Contra|diction.</P>
<P>Thus you &s;ee, how this poor Prince has been treated by Fortune, which has in a moment depriv'd him of Countrey, VVife, and Child, which he loves, and e&s;teems dearer than his own Per&s;on: &s;o that he has been even ready to dye thro' exce&s;&s;ive Sorrow. De&s;irous however to &s;hew the Magnanimity of his Courage, and that not Time, but Vertue, appeas'd his grief, he has &s;o far recomforted him&s;elf, that he has undertaken the Combat again&s;t the two Gyants. And for this Rea&s;on he was &s;ailing towards <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> hoping to obtain of the Emperor &s;ome Kin&s;|man of his, to &s;econd him again&s;t the <HI>Cyclops.</HI></P>
<P>Now it hapned that traver&s;ing the Strait of the <HI>Helle&s;pont,</HI> we met a Galley, that was bound for <HI>Great B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">itain,</HI> the Ma&s;ter of which acquainted us, that the <HI>Defended Mountain</HI> was newly conquer'd by one &s;ole Knight, whom by the marks, I heard given him, I believe to be your &s;elf. The King was &s;o troubl'd at this news for the Amity, there is between him and the Emperor, that he would come a&s;hore, and landing over-again&s;t the mouth of this &s;tream, &s;aw the Forre&s;t &s;o &s;hady, that, thinking to find plea&s;ure in it, he has been more &s;everely handled, than I &s;hould have imagin'd.</P>
<P>I have now &s;o well &s;atisfied your Demands, that there remains nothing but the Accompli&s;hment of your promi&s;e, which will &s;erve only to augment your glo|ry and renown. My humble Reque&s;t therefore is, that you will be pleas'd to ac|company the King into the I&s;le of <HI>Silanchy,</HI> and contribute your A&s;&s;i&s;tance for the Deliverance of the Queen my Mi&s;tre&s;s.

<P>In good faith, Dam&s;el, <HI>an&s;wer'd the</HI> Knight of the burning Sword, this I &s;o willingly granted you, that, had you not de&s;ir'd it, <HI>I</HI> &s;hould my &s;elf have reque&s;ted it of you, having heard the Nature of the Affair: which if I could bring to an end, I &s;hould a&s;&s;uredly account my &s;elf one of the happie&s;t Knights living. For &s;uppo|&s;ing that tho&s;e, who have forc'd away the Queen, and her Daughter, be of the &s;ame Religion with my &s;elf, yet would I not &s;upport them in their wickedne&s;s, ha|ving receiv'd Knight-hood with no other Intention, but to employ my Endeavors for the Relief of tho&s;e, that &s;uffer wrong and inju&s;tice.

<P><HI>During this Di&s;cour&s;e, the King, who had all this while lain in a &s;wound, be|gan to open his Eyes, which the Dam&s;el e&s;pying, went to lift up his Head, and with a &s;miling Countenance &s;aid to him:</HI> Ha! Sir, chear up for GODS &s;ake: For|tune

<P>Sir, <HI>an&s;wer'd he,</HI> I will follow you, where ever you &s;hall command me, not &s;o much to accompany and &s;erve you, as to acquit my &s;elf of what Rea&s;on enjoyns me: for altho' by rea&s;on of the Real Dignity, that is in you, every inferior Per|&s;on ought to &s;erve you; neverthele&s;s the difference of the Religion, I profe&s;s, from that, in which you live, forbids me to favour or a&s;&s;i&s;t you; but not to &s;uccour the Afflicted, in who&s;e Number I reckon you: and for this good work alone I will put my &s;elf in hazard of death, when occa&s;ion &s;hall offer.</P>

For there was ne|ther Rope, nor Sail, which was not torn in pieces, &s;o that bring wholly in de<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="2 letters">air, they abandon'd their Ship to the mercy of the Winds, by which they were driven a|bout for the &s;pace of two Months, not knowing whether, or which way they
<PB N="56" REF="35"> went. Yet the Divine Clemency was &s;o propitious to them, that one <HI>Sunday</HI> mor|ning they found them&s;elves near the Edge of a Forre&s;t, on which the Sea beating, made there an Harbor, tho' little known, becau&s;e unfrequented.</P>
<P>Then the <HI>Knight of the Burning Sword</HI> askt the Marriners, on what Coa&s;t they were. But, when they could not give him any A&s;&s;urance, he, tir'd with the Fatigue of that tedious Storm, and &s;eeing the Countrey &s;ufficiently plea&s;ant, de&s;ir'd the King to go a Shore: which was no unplea&s;ing Reque&s;t to him. Arming them&s;elves therefore, they caus'd their Hor&s;es to be taken out of the Ship, on which they mounted, them|&s;elves carrying their Arms and Shields: for they had not any Company with them, but <HI>Frandamella,</HI> having commanded all the re&s;t to &s;tay for them, and not &s;tir from thence: Being entred into the Forre&s;t, they had not travell'd far, ere they met a Dam&s;el, bitterly lamenting a Knight, whom &s;he bare before her on her Hackney, ve|ry much wounded in his Head, on which &s;he held her hand, to &s;top the too great effu|&s;ion of Blood. Then they askt her his Name, and who had thus outrag'd him.</P>
<P><HI>Alas! my Lords,</HI> an&s;wer'd &s;he, <HI>my ill Fate alone, and not any want of Prowe&s;s in him, who is at this time e&s;teem'd among&s;t valiant men one of the mo&s;t dextrous Knights, that can be found, has been the Cau&s;e of this Misfortune. His Name is,</HI> Farine<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="2 letters"> <HI>of</HI> Car&s;antum, <HI>and he has been thus treated by a Devil, who at the go|ing out of this Wood, keeps a Kay, by which for love of a Gentlewoman, he has in his Company, he &s;uffers not any one to pa&s;s. Now curs'd be the hour, that ever She, or He came hither: for he has now above fifteen days perform'd this Enter|pri&s;e with wonderful courage and &s;ucce&s;s. I therefore coun&s;el you to turn back, and take another way, at lea&s;t if you intend to pa&s;s the Key, from which GOD, pre&s;erve you, and conduct you in &s;afety: for I am going to look for one, that may apply &s;ome Remedy to this Gentleman, my Brother, who, de&s;iring to try him&s;elf again&s;t him, of whom I &s;peak, took me to accompany him: but it is faln out to him but ill, as you &s;ee.</HI></P>
<P>This &s;aid, &s;he pa&s;s'd on, and left the two Knights laughing together, at the coun|&s;el, &s;he had given them. Then they rode forward, till they perceiv'd another Dam|&s;el, coming towards them, mounted on a Palfrey, and bearing a Shield of poli&s;ht Steel without any Device, who &s;aluted them, and addre&s;&s;ing her &s;elf to him <HI>of the Burning Sword,</HI> &s;aid to him: <HI>Sir Knight, I am very glad to meet you, whom I was &s;eeking, to make you a Pre&s;ent of this Shield, as being the compleate&s;t Gen|tleman, I ever &s;aw.

<P>And to &s;ay the Truth, his Shield was &s;o par'd in the Combat he had with his Grandfather the Emperor <HI>E&s;plandian,</HI> that there was &s;carce enough left to cover his Arm.

<ARGUMENT>
<P>How the King of <HI>Sicily,</HI> and the <HI>Knight of the Burning Sword,</HI> fought one after another with the Dutche&s;&s;es Knight: and what befel of it.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THe Knight, that kept the Pa&s;&s;age, as you have been told, having heard the Me&s;|&s;engers An&s;wer, and &s;eeing the King of <HI>Sicily</HI> ready to perform his Devoir, took his Cour&s;e again&s;t him: and their Meeting was with &s;uch impetuo&s;ity, that their Spears, piercing each others Shield, &s;hiver'd to pieces, their Bodies joining &s;o vio|lently, that the Knight of the Kay lo&s;t a Stirrup and the King came to the ground being &s;quatted on the gra&s;s. Yet he very lightly got up again, and putting his hand to h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">s Sword, &s;aid to the other: <HI>A light, Sir Knight: for you &s;hall vanqui&s;h me with the Sword before you have my Shield.</HI></P>
<P><HI>I am well content,</HI> an&s;wer'd the other.</P>
<P>Then he &s;at foot to ground, and without any farther delay there began between them a very fierce Combat, which continu'd the &s;pace of a long half hour, before it could be perceiv'd, which would have the better, or the wor&s;e: Neverthele&s;s a little after the King began to be &s;o enfeebled, that he knew he could not much longer re&s;i&s;t without being &s;lain or vanqui&s;ht: to obviate which he drew a little a&s;ide, and &s;aid to him of the Kay: <HI>Knight, pray let us take breath: The day is long enough for us to fini&s;h this Di&s;pute in.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Our Combat,</HI> an&s;wer'd he, <HI>is more for plea&s;ure than Enmity: Therefore I grant you this &s;atisfaction, altho' I have no need of it.</HI></P>
<P>The King, hearing this gracious An&s;wer, and very well knowing that it was true, bethought him&s;elf (the better to pre&s;erve his Honour, and avoid the Danger) to cover with the vail of Courte&s;ie, what he wanted in force, &s;aying to him: <HI>In good faith, Knight, your Obligingne&s;s has &s;o far vanqui&s;ht me, that, con&s;idering your Enterp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ize to be wholly caus'd by the Love and Service, you bear her, who&s;e you are, I am very well pleas'd to keep company with &s;o many valiant men, as you have prov'd your &s;elf again&s;t, and &s;urrender you my Shield, on which I will write my Name, for to &s;erve the Dutche&s;s, when &s;he &s;hall plea&s;e to command me.</HI></P>
<P>Then he took it from his Neck, to pre&s;ent it to him: but the Knight of the Kay, putting it back with his hand, made him this An&s;wer: <HI>Stay Knight, you &s;hall not leave me your Shield, but if you plea&s;e to let me have your Name, I &s;hall e&s;teem it more than all the Wealth in the world, &s;eeing the Prowe&s;s, and great Civility, you are endu'd with: Not that I have vanqui&s;ht you, who have your &s;elf Conquer'd me, &s;o that I &s;hall be all my life indebted to you, in that you would not con&s;train me to quit this Pa&s;&s;age: for I mu&s;t have immediately retir'd, and lo&s;t the Sight of the thing, I mo&s;t love, which is my Lady.</HI></P>
<P>Then he exactly related to him his Intention, in the &s;ame manner the Dutche&s;s had told it to the Emperor <HI>E&s;plandian</HI> at <HI>Con&s;tantinople.</HI></P>
<PB N="59" REF="36">
<P><HI>In good faith,</HI> &s;aid the King, <HI>had I known &s;o much, you &s;hould have yet had a better bargain of me: for I have my &s;elf with a thou&s;and labours too much experi|mented the Evil, Love works through the lea&s;t disfavour of the belov'd Object. Un|der&s;tand then, that I am</HI> Alpatracy, <HI>King of</HI> Sicily, <HI>and</HI> Metz, <HI>arriv'd not ten hours &s;ince on the&s;e Coa&s;ts, and that not intentionally, but by the greate&s;t Adventure ima|ginable. If therefore you plea&s;e to &s;pare your &s;elf the combating my Companion, I will prevail &s;o far with him, that for my &s;ake he &s;hall forbear it.</HI></P>
<P>The Knight, very glad of the Intelligence, he receiv'd from <HI>Alpatracy,</HI> not &s;o much becau&s;e he was a King, as becau&s;e he had heard him accounted one of the be&s;t Warriours in the World, an&s;wer'd him: <HI>Sir, I cannot &s;ufficiently thank your Ma|je&s;ty for the Honour you do me, who am but a &s;imple Gentleman, and you &s;o great a Prince, that I &s;hall e&s;teem my &s;elf happy to go and &s;erve you in</HI> France <HI>or</HI> Sicily, <HI>as &s;oon as I &s;hall have &s;atisfied my Lady, and of that you may a&s;&s;ure your &s;elf: but as to your Offer of de&s;iring your Companion to de&s;i&s;t from conte&s;ting with me, I be&s;eech you, Sir, to pardon me, and to be content, that I entertain the cu&s;tom of the Kay, being come hither for no other Rea&s;on.</HI></P>
<P><HI>You &s;hall do as you think be&s;t,</HI> an&s;wer'd the King: <HI>it &s;uffices me, that you re|member the promi&s;e, you have made me, to accompany me in the Conque&s;t of my Kingdom of</HI> Metz, <HI>as &s;oon as I &s;hall have fini&s;ht a Voyage, from which I cannot ex|cu&s;e my &s;elf.</HI></P>
<P>Then were their Hor&s;es brought them, on which, when they were mounted, the Dutche&s;s approacht, to know, what Di&s;cour&s;e they had together, which her Knight recounted to her without omitting any thing, whereat &s;he greatly rejoyc'd. And in the mean time he, that came with <HI>Alpatracy,</HI> took &s;uch plea&s;ure in beholding the Ex|cellent Beauty of this Prince&s;s, that he remembred not that he was to Fight, when the Knight of the Kay, who perceiv'd it, call'd to him, &s;aying: <HI>Sir Knight, you have mus'd long enough for once: The cu&s;tom of this Place requires &s;omething el&s;e, than mu&s;ing on Ladies Beauties. Think, Sir, on what you are come for.</HI></P>
<P>And as he utter'd the&s;e words, he went to the Elm, again&s;t which the Lances &s;tood, and cho&s;e from among&s;t them the &s;tronge&s;t, he could find. Then <HI>Alpatracy</HI>'s Companion well knew, that the Knight of the Kay was a little &s;tung with Iealou&s;y, neverthele&s;s he took &s;o unpatiently this Remon&s;trance, that he retir'd back far enough to take a Career, and then &s;eeing his Adver&s;ary ready, &s;et &s;purs to his Hor&s;e, as the other al&s;o did, encountring each other with &s;o much vigour, that they both brake their Spears. Then turning their Bridles, the &s;trange Knight was putting his Hand to his Sword, when he of the Kay de&s;ir'd him to ju&s;t &s;o long, till one, or both of them came to the Ground: to which he readily con&s;ented. The Servants then and E&s;quires advanc'd to bring 'em new Lances, and they brake each of them &s;ix &s;taves, without &s;tirring from their Saddles. This &s;o enrag'd them both, tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter"> at the &s;e|venth charge, their Spears being broken to the very handles, they had &s;uch a Ran|counter of Shields, Bodies, and Heads, their Hor&s;es al&s;o meeting Head to Head, and Shoulder to Shoulder, that they both fell &s;tunny'd on the gra&s;s. Yet the two Com|batants
<PB N="60" REF="37"> &s;oon got up again, and embracing their Shields, fell furiou&s;ly &s;o to hew and hack each other, that in a &s;hort time the place was all over cover'd with the Plates and Pieces of their Haubergeons and Coars of Mail. The <HI>Knight of the Burning Sword</HI> had indeed a very great Advantage over the other, the Shield, which was pre|&s;ented him by the Dam&s;el in the Forre&s;t, being of &s;uch a Temper, that neither Lance nor Sword could make any impre&s;&s;ion on it. Neverthele&s;s he of the Kay behav'd him&s;elf with &s;o much courage, that for the &s;pace of above a long hour it could not be di&s;cern'd, who would have the better.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t they were thus in the heat of their Engagement, there arriv'd King <HI>Ama|dis,</HI> and Queen <HI>Oriana,</HI> attended by a great company of Ladies, Gentlewomen, and Knights, who, having heard of the extraordinary Prowe&s;s of him, that kept the Kay, were come from <HI>London</HI> to &s;ee this Pa&s;time, with purpo&s;e not to part thence in a Weeks time. They perceiv'd then the two Combatants in the Condition, I told you, wherefore they &s;tood &s;till to &s;ee, which of them would gain the Honour of the Vi|ctory, King <HI>Amadis</HI> him&s;elf not knowing what to think of it, &s;eeing them &s;o full of Animo&s;ity one again&s;t the other. Nor was his wonder a little increa&s;t, when he was told, that they had been above two hours in the&s;e Tran&s;ports, without taking the lea&s;t Repo&s;e, or Breath, &s;o that the be&s;t, they could expect, was the &s;peedy Death of one of them, if not of both together. Which &s;o a&s;toni&s;ht the Dutche&s;s, that &s;he knew not what countenance to keep, tho' &s;he put on a &s;miling and a&s;&s;ured look, the better to keep her Knight in heart: who, willing to leave nothing unattempted, us'd all imaginable Endeavours to vanqui&s;h his Enemy. But his Adver&s;ary was too &s;trong, and pretending al&s;o to the &s;ame End, at which he aim'd, pre&s;s'd him &s;o clo&s;e that he now no longer did any thing, but parry his Shield to the others Blows: at which the Dutche&s;s, as de&s;pairing of his &s;afety, &s;o exceedingly chang'd colour, that he perceiv'd it, and entred into &s;uch a Rage, that re&s;olving to win the Hor&s;e or lo&s;e the Saddle, he took his Sword in both hands, and &s;truck his Enemy with &s;o much fo ce, that he made him &s;et his knee to the ground. Yet he got nimbly up again, and, to re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">enge him&s;elf, &s;o handled the other, that his Armor was in no place of &s;trength enough, to hinder the Edge of his Enemies Sword from piercing to the quick, &s;o that it was plainly to be &s;een, that, if he per&s;i&s;ted any longer, his Death was near.</P>
<P>Now, as he was in &s;uch extremity, there came in great ha&s;t a Dam&s;el, Riding on a Palfrey, who at her approach cry'd out as loud, as &s;he could: <HI>Hola, Knights, hola, hear, what I have to &s;ay.</HI></P>
<P>At this cry the two Combatants drew back a little from each other, and the Dam|&s;el, addre&s;&s;ing her &s;elf to the <HI>Knight of the Burning Sword,</HI> askt him, if he did not know her.</P>
<P><HI>Yes &s;urely do I,</HI> an&s;wer'd he: <HI>for you have this day given me the be&s;t Shield in the World.</HI></P>
<P><HI>'Tis true,</HI> reply'd the Dam&s;el, <HI>and I am come to demand of you the Gift, you pro|mis'd me; which is, that without any delay you leave this Combat in the Condition it is in, and return with your Companion to your Mariners, who expect you.</HI></P>
<PB N="61" REF="37">
<P><HI>In good faith Dam&s;el,</HI> an&s;wer'd he, <HI>you are very &s;hort with me, yet I will &s;atis|fy you, what ever may come of it.</HI></P>
<P>Scarce had he utter'd this word, when the Dam&s;el, turning her Bridle and whip|ping her Palfrey, entred the Forre&s;t, and got &s;oon out of &s;ight, leaving the <HI>Knight of the Burning Sword</HI> di&s;pleas'd even to death, for being hindred to pro&s;ecute his a&s;|&s;ured Victory: for his word having oblig'd him, he would not for any thing in the world infringe it. Wherefore having again mounted his Hor&s;e, he and the King re|turn'd back to the Sea-&s;ide, thinking well, that the Dam&s;el had not without my&s;tery appeas'd this Quarrel. Being then come to their Ships, and having caus'd their wounds to be dre&s;t, they commanded their Marriners to weigh Anchor, and hoy<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">e up Sail, once again &s;teering their cour&s;e towards the I&s;le of <HI>Silanchy.</HI></P>
<P>Now becau&s;e King <HI>Amadis</HI> had not &s;een the Combat between the Knight and <HI>Al|patracy,</HI> and that he was told, how they had made Peace together, he askt the Knight of the Kay, whether he knew him, and the other al&s;o.</P>
<P><HI>Sir,</HI> an&s;wer'd the Knight, <HI>He in the rich Arms is the King of</HI> Sicily; <HI>but of his Companion I know nothing, &s;ave that he has given me the be&s;t Rubbing <HI>I</HI> ever had in my life.</HI></P>
<P><HI>In good faith,</HI> &s;aid the King, <HI>he is a gallant man, and <HI>I</HI> am very glad of the Ad|venture, which thus parted you: Yet had <HI>I</HI> thought that the King of</HI> Sicily <HI>was in the&s;e parts, he &s;hou d have kept us company a little longer, unle&s;s he had po&s;itively refus'd me: for <HI>I</HI> love and e&s;teem him, as one of the be&s;t Princes on the Earth.</HI></P>
<P>Now the Knight of the Kay was &s;o wounded, that he was fain to keep his Bed for fifteen days together: and therefore we will leave him at pre&s;ent, to follow another matter.</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P>How King <HI>Amadis</HI> had News, that the Emperor <HI>E&s;plandian</HI> had reconquer'd the <HI>Defended Mountain,</HI> and knew, that 'twas the <HI>Knight of the Burning Sword,</HI> who had &s;o &s;everely handled the Knight of the Kay.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THere was mention made in the foregoing Chapter, that, as the King of <HI>Sicily</HI> and the Dutche&s;&s;es Knight were beginning their Combat, there came thither two Gentlemen, one in black Armor, and the other in white. Now you &s;hall under|&s;tand that, after King <HI>Amadis</HI> had left the wounded Knight, as he was retiring to a Pavilion, which he had caus'd to be &s;et up for him&s;elf, where the Queen <HI>Oriana</HI> at|tended him, the two Gentlemen, whom I e'er while mentioned, came to meet him, and making him a very low Abai&s;ance, he in the black Arms &s;pake thus: <HI>M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;t ex|cellent Prince, this Companion of mine, nam'd</HI> Orizenes, <HI>Son to your Nephew, the King of</HI> California, <HI>and my &s;elf, nam'd</HI> Brabartus <HI>of</HI> Sircia, <HI>Son to you other Nephew King</HI> Perion, <HI>and the Queen</HI> Pintiqu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ne&s;tra, <HI>are come expre&s;ly to &s;uppli|cate
<PB N="62" REF="38"> your Maje&s;ty, to give us the Order of Knighthood, hoping afterwards to go in que&s;t of, and find out, if it be po&s;&s;ible,</HI> Perion <HI>and</HI> Li&s;vart, <HI>who are &s;aid to be lo&s;t with the Emperor of</HI> Trebi&s;ond, <HI>e&s;teeming our Travel very well employ'd to that purpo&s;e, if it may be plea&s;ing to you, and you may by this beginning know the de&s;ire, we have to &s;erve you for ever.</HI></P>
<P>The King, who had never before &s;een them, embrac't them, and gave them a very good Reception, &s;aying to them: <HI>I <HI>am indeed very glad of this your good Will, and accept it very kindly.</HI></HI></P>
<P>Then he took them, one in his Right hand, and the other in his left, and led them to <HI>Oriana,</HI> and telling her, who they were, &s;he receiv'd them very affectionately, the King deferring to make them Knights, till &s;uch time as the Knight of the Kay was recover'd. In the mean time he re&s;olv'd to Hunt the Stag, to that end &s;ending for Hunt&s;men and Dogs, with which he often gave the Ladies Recreation. In the mid&s;t of the&s;e Tran&s;actions, there arriv'd a Courier, &s;ent by the Emperor <HI>E&s;plandi|an</HI> to acquaint the King with his having regain'd the <HI>Defended Mountain,</HI> the Em|peror having written him a particular Account of all, that had pa&s;s'd between him|&s;elf, and the <HI>Knight of the Burning Sword,</HI> even the Danger he was in of lo&s;ing his life, had not the Dam&s;el <HI>Alquifa</HI> parred them. The King was much troubled at this Fews, as well becau&s;e the Emperor did not tell him, that he was no longer in dan|ger, as al&s;o by rea&s;on there came into his mind the Di&s;cour&s;es, made to him by the Child in the Forre&s;t, and the Threats with which he then menac'd him, as it is recorded in the &s;ixth Book of <HI>Amad<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">s</HI> of <HI>Gaul.</HI> Yet he prudently conceal'd, what he thought, making the Courier no other An&s;wer, but that Thanks ought to be rendred to our Lord for the recovery of the Place, and then askt him, whether he had ever &s;ince had any News of the <HI>Knight of the Burning Sword.</HI></P>
<P><HI>No Sir,</HI> an&s;wer'd the Courier, <HI>he went, as the Emperor has written you word, after the Dam&s;el</HI> Alquifa, <HI>and we never knew, what became of him.</HI></P>
<P><HI>He will be found again &s;ome other time,</HI> &s;aid the King, and went immediately to vi&s;it the Knight of the Kay, into who&s;e Tent he had &s;carce &s;et foot, when there en|tred a Dam&s;el, Si&s;ter to <HI>Farineus</HI> of <HI>Car&s;antum,</HI> who, having left her Brother in the Chirurgeons hands, came to give the King notice, &s;he had met the <HI>Knight of the Burning Sword,</HI> for &s;he knew by Report, that he had conquer'd the <HI>Defended Mountain.</HI> And for this cau&s;e, as &s;oon as &s;he &s;aw <HI>Amadis,</HI> &s;he fell down on her knees, and &s;aid to him: <HI>Sir, the Knight who, as they &s;ay, fought</HI> Frandalo, <HI>and his People, is to my certain knowledge in this Country.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Is he &s;o?</HI> &s;aid the King: <HI>and have you &s;een him?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Yes Sir,</HI> an&s;wer'd the Dam&s;el</P>
<P>Then &s;he related to the King, how &s;he met him in the Forre&s;t, as &s;he was carry|ing her Brother: <HI>And for the greater certainty,</HI> &s;aid &s;he, <HI>he had yet his Shield with the Burning &s;word, and was accompany'd by another in the riche&s;t Armor, I ever &s;aw in my Life.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Never tru&s;t me,</HI> an&s;wer'd the King, <HI>if it were not he, that thus &s;everely treated
<PB N="63" REF="38"> our Knight, having chang'd his Arms the better to conceal him&s;elf: But had <HI>I</HI> known him, I would have given him the Honour, and good Entertainment, he merits.</HI></P>
<P>Yet he &s;pake again&s;t his own Con&s;cience: for he would have undoubtedly put him to death, not being able to forget the Childs Threatning, which I ju&s;t now mentio|ned: for which cau&s;e he would have &s;ent after him, had he not remembred the Re|que&s;t, the Dam&s;el made him, to return to his Ship. Now there were many good Knights, who knowing, that the <HI>Knight of the Burning Sword</HI> was thus e&s;cap'd, without being any farther try d in Great <HI>Britain,</HI> were very much di&s;pleas'd: for they would willingly have combated him, to know by experience, whether, what Fame reported of him, were true. And he of the Kay promis d him&s;elf, that, after he had recover'd his Health, and acquitted him&s;elf of his Oath to the Dutche&s;s, he would not &s;tay in any place, till he had found him, and fought him again. Nor was it long ere he was &s;trong enough to bear Arms: which being come to the knowledge of King <HI>Amadis,</HI> he told <HI>Orizenes</HI> and <HI>B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">avartus,</HI> that he would on the m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">rrow give them the Order, for which cau&s;e they kept the watch, and in the morning were made Knights, the Queen her &s;elf girding on their Swords. And to the end &s;he and the other Ladies might thenceforth better, and with more ea&s;e &s;ee the Iu&s;ts and Com|bats, which &s;hould be perform'd at the Kay, the King commanded a Seaffold to be e|rected, on which they continu'd not long idle, before they perceiv'd &s;ix Knights come out of the Forre&s;t, marching lei&s;ucely towards them.</P>
<P>The Dutche&s;s, &s;eeing this, &s;ent her Me&s;&s;enger to acquaint them with the u&s;ual Covenants whom they an&s;wer'd, that they would for this rea&s;on pa&s;s the Kay.

<P>THe Overthrow of the &s;ix foregoing Knights gave &s;uch an Example to light Vn|dertakers, that for four days after not one pre&s;ented him&s;elf to hazard his Re|putation again&s;t him, whom they nam'd <HI>The Wont to overcome.</HI> Neverthele&s;s be|fore the Week was out, as King <HI>Amadis,</HI> newly ri&s;en from Table, was walking along a Gallery, he de&s;cry'd far enough off, two Knights advantageou&s;ly arm'd and mounted: To whom the Dutche&s;s (according to the Cu&s;tom) &s;ent her Dam&s;el Me&s;|&s;enger, to acquaint them with the Place, by which they were to pa&s;s, and the Con|ditions, to which they were oblig'd. She, who was no Apprentice in &s;uch Amba&s;|&s;ades, did what &s;he was commanded; but the Knights an&s;wer'd her, that they came for no other purpo&s;e: wherefore &s;he return'd.</P>
<P>Soon after the Dutche&s;&s;es Knight took one of the bigge&s;t Lances, he could find, and &s;etting Spurs to his Hor&s;e, ran &s;o vigorou&s;ly again&s;t him, who pre&s;ented him|&s;elf, that their Shields were pierc't, and their Staves broken to the very Gantlet, di&s;jointing their Armors even to the Fle&s;h, without receiving any other hurt, as they well gave to under&s;tand: for at the end of their Career they turn'd about, and putting their hands to their Swords, began to treat one another, not as in a Tour|ney for Plea&s;ure, but as if they had fought for &s;ome Quarrel, which they were obli|ged to maintain with their Lives. Nor was it a little Honour, that the Knight of the Forre&s;t gain'd there: for, during the Space of a long hour and above, he be|hav'd him&s;elf &s;o valiantly, that the Dutche&s;&s;es Knight knew not where he was. Wherefore irritated with extream Choler, he lift up his Sword, and thinking to beat down the other, ru&s;ht upon him with all his force; but he w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">th his Shield war|ded off the blow, which was &s;o violent, that making way through all o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">po&s;ition, it fell upon the Hor&s;es head, who immediately dropt down dead, carrying his Ma&s;ter along with him, and &s;o di&s;advantageou&s;ly, that he was not able to get up again, the Bea&s;t lay &s;o heavy on his Right Leg. And as the Knight of the Kay was alighting, to make him &s;wear the Performance of the u&s;ual Covenants, the other cry'd out, that he accorded him both his Name and his Shield, &s;ince Fortune had &s;o disfavour'd him through the fault of his Steed.</P>
<P>Then there came Servants and Squires, who freed him out of this little ea&s;e, and he &s;tood by with a great deal of Confu&s;ion, expecting what would befall his Compa|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="2 letters">on. Who &s;eeing the Dutche&s;&s;es Knight in the li&s;ts, and with a new Lance, ran
<PB N="65" REF="39"> again&s;t him, both gallantly breaking their Spears; but their Meeting was &s;uch, that the Dutche&s;&s;es Knight lo&s;t one of his Stirrups, being ready to fall, had he not caught hold of his Hor&s;es Mane. The others luck was yet wor&s;e: for he and his Steed were in one moment overthrown, &s;o that they were both thought to have broken their Necks, which gave the Dutche&s;&s;es Knight great occa&s;ion to alight, and &s;ee how it was. Yet could he not make &s;o much ha&s;t, but that his Adver&s;ary was got on his Feet, and with his Sword in hand, and Shield before him, fully determin'd to Re|venge the Injury he had &s;uffer'd. Then they charg'd one another &s;o furiou&s;ly for three quarters of an hour together that it could not be known which of them had the Ad|vantage. Neverthele&s;s they were fain in the end to re&s;t, tho' this Repo&s;e la&s;ted but a little, e'er they began again their Di&s;pute with greater fiercene&s;s, than before: whence there proceeded &s;uch Execution, that their Arms were batter'd, and unrivet|ted, and their Fle&s;h in many places dy'd with Blood, altho' neither the one nor the o|ther made (for all this) the lea&s;t &s;hew of fear, but kept up yet a long hour, &s;till per&s;i&s;ting to do better and better.</P>
<P>But the Spectators were all amaz'd, &s;eeing the Knight of the Forre&s;t, as he was giving a &s;tep a&s;ide, fall in a Swound to the ground, at which his Companion, who beheld him, being exceedingly di&s;contented, as thinking him to be dead, made the greate&s;t mean imaginable, and throwing his Helmet far from him on the ground cry'd out &s;o loud, that every one heard him: <HI>Alas! our fooli&s;h Pre&s;umption has well de|ceiv'd us, and yet better cha&s;tis'd us: for we ought to con&s;ider, that this is the be&s;t Knight in the World; and yet we were &s;o temerarious, as unfortunately to &s;et our &s;elves again&s;t him.</HI></P>
<P>Then were they known, the one to be <HI>Orizenes,</HI> and the other <HI>Bravartus,</HI> who (the better to make tryal of their Per&s;ons again&s;t the Dutche&s;&s;es Friend) had thus di&s;guis'd them&s;elves, and that to their Dammage: for they were both in danger to lo&s;e their Lives, e&s;pecially <HI>Bravartus,</HI> who was incontinently di&s;arm'd, and &s;o well lookt after, that he began to grow better than 'twas expected. Yet was not King <HI>Amadis</HI> pleas'd with their Folly, but privately remon&s;trated to them, that they ought to have &s;o born this Enterprize, con&s;idering the Experience, they had &s;een of the &s;trange Knight, who was no le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">s glad of his Victory, than the others were &s;orry for being vanqui&s;ht, tho' he were con&s;train'd to keep his Bed, as well as <HI>Bravartus</HI> and <HI>Orizenes.</HI> And in the mean while the Dutche&s;s, who bare him Company, askt him from time to time how he did.</P>
<P><HI>Madam,</HI> an&s;wer'd he, <HI>the Joy, I have, in beholding continually your excellent Beauty, &s;o much ea&s;es my Illne&s;s, that I feel no Pain in any wound, how dangerous &s;oever, e&s;pecially &s;ince they were gain'd in your Service.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Alas! my Friend,</HI> &s;aid &s;he, <HI>you do &s;o much for me, that I ought not a little to re|joyce at it: &s;ince there is not in the World any Prince&s;s &s;o great, but would e&s;teem her &s;elf hap<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">y to have you for hers, con&s;idering the Goodne&s;s, and high Chivalry, with which you are endow'd.

<P><HI>You &s;hall make me,</HI> an&s;wer'd he, <HI>what you plea&s;e, and I well know, that none can better judge than my &s;elf, of how great worth you are in your own per&s;on, &s;et|ting a&s;ide your Quality, and the Hou&s;e, of which you are de&s;cended: in&s;omuch that neither</HI> Li&s;vart <HI>of</HI> Greece, <HI>e&s;teem'd the Flower of Knighthood, nor all tho&s;e, who are reckon'd at this day among&s;t the Valiante&s;t Men on Earth, are worthy to give &s;o much as one Glance of the Eye on the lea&s;t of your Perfections. And I, who am in compari&s;on of them but a Dream, how much am I render'd yours by the Fa|vours, you do me? For by them has that Succe&s;sfulne&s;s in Feats of Arms, for which you give me &s;o much Prai&s;e, been known to be in me, with all the re&s;t of that Goodne&s;s, if I am indu'd with any. I will therefore dye, but I will obtain the Rich Helmet, with the Sword, and Shield of value, which you promi&s;e to the be&s;t Combatant: well knowing, that, letting them be lo&s;t, I &s;hall lo&s;e your Love, with|out ever daring to appear before you.</HI></P>
<P><HI>In good faith, my great Friend,</HI> &s;aid &s;he, <HI>you do me wrong, to doubt thus of my Con&s;tancy, &s;ince there is not any thing either in Heaven, or Earth, that can efface out of my mind the Good, I de&s;ire you. And &s;hould we happen by Fortune, or otherwi&s;e, to be &s;eparated one from the other, believe me, I would at the &s;ame time &s;eparate my Life from my Body, which is, and &s;hall be yours to the end.</HI></P>
<P>In this manner did the Dutche&s;s content her pa&s;&s;ionate Heart, expecting the Re|covery of her Knight, whom the King vi&s;ited almo&s;t every day.</P>
<P>Now <HI>Orizenes</HI> and <HI>Bravartus</HI> found them&s;elves &s;ome time after &s;trong enough to Travel: Wherefore they humbly be&s;ought <HI>Amadis</HI> to give them leave, to go in que&s;t of <HI>Perion</HI> of <HI>Gaul,</HI> and <HI>Lifvart</HI> of <HI>Greece,</HI> which he willingly granted them.

<ARGUMENT>
<P>How the King of <HI>Sicily,</HI> and the <HI>Knight of the Burning Sword</HI> Arriv'd in the I&s;le of <HI>Silanchy,</HI> where they fought <HI>Frandalon</HI> the <HI>Ciclops</HI> and his Son.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THe King of <HI>Sicily,</HI> and the <HI>Knight of the Burning Sword,</HI> being departed from the Place, where they had fought the Dutche&s;&s;es Friend, rode on with <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ran|damella,</HI> till they came, where they had left their Ships. Having caus'd their Wounds to be carefully lookt into, they commanded their Marriners to &s;teer as di|rectly, as po&s;&s;ibly they could, to the I&s;le of <HI>Silanchy;</HI> but they were &s;carce got a League from Shore, when <HI>Frandamella,</HI> addre&s;&s;ing her &s;elf to the <HI>Knight of the Burning Sword,</HI> pre&s;ented him a Letter from her, who, as you have heard, parted from him at the Kay, telling him, that &s;he had expre&s;ly charg'd her, not to deliver it to him any &s;ooner, and therefore he might read it at his lei&s;ure. Then the Knight, taking it, brake open the Seal, to &s;ee the Contents, which were, as follow.</P>
<P><HI>&V;rganda <HI>the</HI> &V;nknown <HI>to the</HI> Knight of the Burning Sword <HI>&s;ends Greeting. Know that to free another out of Pri&s;on, thou &s;halt within a few days enter into the grea|te&s;t Captivity, ever poor Slave was in, and &s;halt have thy Soul and Body &s;o affli|cted, that the &s;ame Sword, which has many times &s;av'd the Place, whence thou art i&s;&s;u'd, &s;hall pierce thro' thy Body, whence it &s;hall be afterwards drawn out by the hands of her, who, thinking to &s;ave her &s;elf, &s;hall re&s;tore thee a Life, wor&s;e than a thou&s;and Deaths together. And this Bitterne&s;s &s;hall la&s;t thee, till &s;uch time as thy Fathers Hou&s;e, being at the point to fall to Ruine, &s;hall be pre&s;erv'd, and &s;av'd by its fir&s;t Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or. Believe me: for it &s;hall come to pa&s;s, as I foretel thee. And to the end thou may&s;t credit it, under&s;tand, that, to pre&s;erve thee from a Mi&s;|fortune, into which thou wa&s;t this day about to fall by fighting with the Knight of the Kay, I pre&s;ented thee the white Shield, and asked thee the Gift, thou granted&s;t me, and performed&s;t, and for which thou ought&s;t to give me thanks: becau&s;e without my Providence thou wert &s;alling into a Repentance for all thy life, as thou wilt better know in time.

<P>Exceeding Pen&s;ive was the <HI>Knight of the Burning Sword,</HI> and what rendred h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">m yet more Melancholy, was, that he could not comprehend any thing in it, but what &s;eem'd to him grievous to be born. He &s;aid neverthele&s;s within him&s;elf, that he
<PB N="68" REF="41"> was indeed extreamly bound to <HI>Urganda,</HI> who had done &s;o much for him; but &s;ince he could not re&s;i&s;t the De&s;tinies, he would pa&s;s it over as well, as he could. The bet|ter therefore to conceal his Thoughts, he began to look plea&s;antly, &s;aying, <HI>Urgan|da</HI> acquainted him, that the Countrey, they had then left was, Great <HI>Britain,</HI> and that they &s;hould thenceforward have fair weather.</P>
<P>Thus &s;ail'd they with &s;o favourable a Sea, that the King, and he, being cur'd of all their Wounds, di&s;cover'd one <HI>Sunday</HI> Morning <HI>Frandalons</HI> Fortre&s;s, at the neere&s;t Port to which they Anchred, and went all a Shore, except the Mariners, who continu d aboard, expecting what would be the I&s;&s;ue of this Enterprize, to which the King went, accompany'd by thirty Knights, be&s;ide him <HI>of the Burning Sword,</HI> fearing, that <HI>Frandalon,</HI> who had taken away the Queen and <HI>Lucella,</HI> would not re|&s;tore them according to the Conditions of the Combat, he had granted; but in&s;tead of doing it, would endeavour by &s;ome Trea&s;on to Arre&s;t him al&s;o.</P>
<P>For this cau&s;e they marcht in very good Equipage &s;trait to a Grove of Trees, where they were de&s;cry'd by the Sentinel of the Ca&s;tle, who winded a Horn &s;o loud, that they heard him: and &s;oon after they &s;aw, coming towards them with great &s;peed, a Dam&s;el, mounted on a Palfrey, who addre&s;&s;ing her &s;elf to the King, whom by the Richne&s;s of his Armor &s;he took to be the chief among&s;t them, &s;aid to him: <HI>Knight, My Lord</HI> Frandalon <HI>the</HI> Ciclops, <HI>&s;ends me to know, who you are, that have en|tred &s;o familiarly into his Land without his Permi&s;&s;ion.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Dam&s;el,</HI> an&s;wer'd the King, <HI>acquaint him, that, if he will accompli&s;h his Pro|mi&s;e, made to</HI> Alpatracy, <HI>who&s;e Wife and Daughter he injuriou&s;ly detains, he &s;hall find him, and another Knight, ready to fight him and his Son. But becau&s;e we cannot confide in his Word by rea&s;on of his wicked Di&s;po&s;ition, he mu&s;t &s;end us an Ho&s;tage, before we enter the Field one again&s;t another; el&s;e we &s;hall con&s;ider, what we have to do.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Ha! ha!</HI> &s;aid the Dam&s;el, &s;miling, and &s;haking her Head: <HI>You have Rea&s;on: but he comes &s;oon enough, who &s;eeks his own Misfortune, which, a&s;&s;ure your &s;elf, will &s;oon be &s;hewn you.</HI></P>
<P>Then going back the way, &s;he came, &s;he re-entred the Fortre&s;s, whence &s;he re|turn'd a little after to tell the King, it would have been more agreeable to <HI>Frandalon,</HI> that he had freely and without di&s;pute &s;urrender'd him the Countrey of <HI>Sicily,</HI> which belong'd to him by r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ght of Inheritance: <HI>Neverthele&s;s,</HI> &s;aid &s;he, <HI>&s;ince you are o|therwi&s;e inclin'd, he will &s;end you his only Daughter for the Security, you demand, on condition, that you &s;end back all your People, keeping only with you, him, that is to be the Companion of your Infelicity: for there is none in his Ca&s;tle, but him|&s;elf and Son, of whom you &s;hould have any doubt.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Dam&s;el,</HI> an&s;wer'd the King, <HI>his Daughter being come, we &s;hall do, what is fit for us.</HI></P>
<P>Then the Me&s;&s;enger return'd back again, where &s;he &s;tay'd not long, before &s;he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ought forth <HI>Frandalons</HI> daughter, &s;o fair, well dre&s;s'd, and of &s;uch good Behaviour,

Such was the Accoutrement of this Virgin, whom the King courteou&s;ly &s;aluted: and yet &s;he regarded him not, but addre&s;t her &s;elf to the <HI>Knight of the Burning Sword,</HI> whom &s;he &s;aw without a Beard, and &s;aid to him: <HI>Are you then he, who are to fight with the King again&s;t my Father and Brother?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Yes, Madam,</HI> an&s;wer'd the Knight: <HI>but why do you ask?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Becau&s;e,</HI> reply'd &s;he, <HI>I <HI>think &s;ome of my Women much fitter for &s;uch Dances than you, whom a Ladies Hood would better become, than that Helmet, which thus heats your Head.</HI></HI></P>
<P>Tho' the <HI>Knight of the Burning Sword</HI> perceiv'd him&s;elf jeer'd, yet did he but laugh at it, &s;aying to her: <HI>In faith Madam, if all the Beauties of this Countrey re|&s;emble you, it will never be thought, I came hither to make love, and much le&s;s, that You and I are one mans Children.</HI></P>
<P>Whil&s;t they were in this di&s;cour&s;e, they perceiv'd <HI>Frandalon,</HI> and his Son, come forth: wherefo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">e the King commanded his Folks to retire, and take with them the Giante&s;s for Ho&s;tage.</P>
<P>'Twas not long ere the two <HI>Ciclops</HI> approacht, the Father being mounted on a Bea&s;t, almo&s;t like a Dromedary, and having no other Arms, but a Shield of fine Steel, hanging about his Neck, and in his hand a Battle. Ax, ma&s;&s;y, and weighty, fit for &s;o genteel and gracious a Gentleman, as he was. So it is, that there was not &s;een in his time any man bigger than him&s;elf, nor had he any more Eyes than his Daughter: and for this rea&s;on was he al&s;o call'd <HI>Ciclops</HI> His Son, who was much le&s;s in Stature than him&s;elf, was Arm'd with a &s;trong Haubergeon. having a great Semiter at his Girdle, and bearing a &s;tiff Lance on his Thigh. Now when they were come within a Career of the King, the Giant cry'd out to him as loud, as he could: <HI>Surrender to me my Countrey, if thou art wi&s;e, and enter willingly into my Pri&s;ons, or thou &s;halt dye piteou&s;ly by my hands, and the Villian al&s;o, that ac|companies thee.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Ho great Loggerhead,</HI> an&s;wer'd the King, <HI>do&s;t think, we have traver&s;t &s;o many Seas, to be in &s;uch manner care&s;s'd by thee?

<P><HI>Sir,</HI> &s;aid the <HI>Knight of the Burning Sword, I be&s;eech you to let me di&s;pute this Quarrel with him, whil&s;t you take the other to task.</HI></P>
<P><HI>I will do what you plea&s;e,</HI> an&s;wer'd the King.</P>
<P>At this word the Knight pull'd down his Vi&s;or, and ran with &s;uch &s;tr ngth a|gain&s;t <HI>Frandalon,</HI> that he nail'd his Shield and Thigh together: Neverthele&s;s the Giant thought, as he pa&s;s'd, to be even with him, and &s;eparate him in two; but as he lifted up his Arm, the <HI>Knight of the Burning Sword</HI> avoided the Blow, and the
<PB N="70" REF="42"> Ax fell in vain, their Bodies meeting with &s;uch force, that <HI>Frandalon,</HI> wounded and weakned in his Leg, could not keep his Saddle, no more than could the Knight, who with this great Sheck, and by the &s;trength of his Lance, the Girths and Bows of his Saddle breaking, was carry'd over his Hor&s;es Crupper, tho' without receiving any farther hurt. Yet was he not at all contented with his Fortune, but getting up in a rage, &s;et his hand to his Sword to &s;trike <HI>Frandalon,</HI> who being thus wounded, as you have heard could not &s;tand on his Feet, but was fain to &s;it on the ground, kee|ping neverthele&s;s an a&s;&s;ured look, and giving the Knight at his approach &s;o great a Blow, that had he not &s;upported him&s;elf by clapping down his right hand, he had faln flat on the ground. But before the Giant could recover his Ax, the <HI>Knight of the Burning Sword,</HI> taking him unprovided, cleft his Head a&s;under, he having nei|ther Headpiece, nor Cap to &s;ave it.</P>
<P>His Son (who had not &s;tir'd till then, nor yet the King, the better to behold the Combat of the two others) &s;eeing this, was &s;o &s;urpriz'd, and inflam'd with Choler, that he ran with full &s;peed again&s;t <HI>Alpatracy,</HI> to whom he gave &s;o great a blow with his Lance, that wounding him &s;everely in the Brea&s;t, he threw him to the Ground: At which the <HI>Knight of the Burning Sword</HI> exceedingly di&s;contented, as doubting him to be dead, re&s;olv'd to revenge him; but the young <HI>Cyclops</HI> little car'd for it, thinking &s;oon to bring him to Rea&s;on. And for this cau&s;e couching his Spear, he thought at lea&s;t by running his Hor&s;e over him to example him down, when the Knight, who was nimble and qu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ck, turn'd a&s;ide, and in his turning gave the others Hor&s;e &s;uch a Blow, that he ham-&s;tring'd him, by which the young <HI>Frandalon</HI> was con&s;train'd to alight, and fig<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">t on foot. But in the mean time the <HI>Knight of the Burning Sword</HI> &s;eiz'd on the Giants Ax, with which he made head again&s;t the other, who thought with one Blow of his Semiter to hew him down: which without doubt he had done, had it not &s;o turn'd in his Hand, that the very weight of the Blow forc't it from him. But the <HI>Knight of the Burning &s;word</HI> was more &s;ucce&s;sful, &s;triking the Giant &s;o home with his great Ax, that cleaving down his right Shoulder, he parted his Soul from his Bod<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">.</P>
<P>Then the Conqueror came to the King, whom <HI>Frandamella</HI> held in her lap in a Swound; neverthele&s;s as &s;oon as his Helmet was taken off, that he might have Air, he began to breath again.</P>
<P>Now the Queen <HI>Miramynia,</HI> and <HI>Lucella,</HI> had &s;een him overthrown, and doub|ting him to be wor&s;e than he was, wept and bewail'd him bitterly, and &s;o loud, that the King heard them cry, and lament: Wherefore he took heart, and to recomfort them, got up, feigning that he felt not either Hurt or Pain.

<PB N="71" REF="42"> would not however &s;trike her with his Sword, but took a Truncheon of a Lane, with which he made her &s;uch a Fly-&s;lap, that &s;he began to Stagger, as if &s;he were giving up the Gho&s;t.</P>
<P>Then the Knight left her, and return'd to the King, who embrac'd him, &s;aying to him: <HI>Alas! Ble&s;&s;ed be the day of your Birth: for be&s;ides my Life, which you have &s;av'd, I recover this day by your means, what I mo&s;t prize of any thing in the World.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Sir,</HI> an&s;wer'd the Knight, <HI>give thanks only to your good Right: for I have done nothing, but what I was oblig'd to by rea&s;on. But does it not plea&s;e you, that we go to the Queen, and my Lady your Daughter, whom I &s;ee at the Win|dows of yonder Tower: For I believe, they expect you with very great de|votion.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Let us go then, I be&s;eech you,</HI> an&s;wer'd the King</P>
<P>Then they went towards the Ca&s;tle, and when they were come nigh, the Qugh call'd out to them, that they &s;hould take the Keys from the Giante&s;s, &s;ince they could not otherwi&s;e get into the Tower, in which, &s;he and her Daughter were enclos'd. The King therefore &s;ent <HI>Frandamella</HI> to ferth them: and in the mean time they went on into the outer Court, whither they were no &s;ooner got, but they heard their Dam&s;el crying, and calling out for help: wherefore ha&s;ting towards her, they per|ceiv'd her running with full &s;peed from the Giante&s;s, who follow'd her, with the Truneheon of the Lance; &s;o that the King and the Knight could not forbear laugh|ing, to &s;ee the Race, that was between them. Neverthele&s;s fearing, le&s;t <HI>Franda|mella</HI> might be out tag'd by the Giante&s;s, they &s;tept forward to &s;ave her: but the Giante&s;s turn'd back cro&s;s the Fields, carrying along with her the Keys of the To|wer, and running &s;o fa&s;t, that they could not overtake hee Moreover (the better to &s;ecure her &s;elf) &s;he went &s;o far into the Take which on one &s;ide environ'd the place, that the <HI>Knight of the Burning Sword</HI> could not get near her; but giving her to all the Devils, return'd towards the King, who had in the mean time &s;ent <HI>Frandamel|la</HI> to the Shore, to fetch thence Ten of his Knights, who might force the Giante&s;s. They, under&s;tanding, in what manner the Fight was ended, were fill'd with unex|pre&s;&s;ible joy. They made ha&s;t then out of the Ship, and went &s;trait to the Ca&s;tle, where before their Arrival, the Giante&s;s, who had &s;een the King and the <HI>Knight of the burning Sword</HI> go into the inner Court; and the Queen al&s;o withdraw from the Window, came forth of the Water, and ran &s;traight th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">o' the outward Court into an Hall, where &s;he caught up a &s;trong Bow, and a Quiver full of Arrows, with which returning back, &s;he took the Shield of the Giant her Husband, and a great Semiter which hung at his &s;ide: and then got back again into the Lake without be|ing perceiv'd by the King, or any other: for they were gone up into the Chambers, where they found two men weeping, whom they commanded to &s;hew them the door of the Tower.</P>
<P>They trembling through Exce&s;s of Fear, led them to an Iron Door, fa&s;tned with
<PB N="72" REF="43"> a great Pad-lock, whither being come: <HI>There is</HI> (&s;ay they) <HI>be&s;ides this another door, &s;tronger, and better barr'd, and both of the one and the other the Giante&s;s has the Keys, &s;o that 'tis imp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;&s;ible to get in without her.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Sir,</HI> &s;aid the <HI>Knight of the burning Sword, you are greatly wounded: I am of opinion therefore, that you di&s;arm your &s;elf, and ly d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">wn on this bed, to the end I may bind up your Wounds, and then I will con&s;ider of &s;ome means to reco|ver your Queen and Daughter.</HI></P>
<P>To this the King accorded, who &s;oon after fell a&s;leep, and for this cau&s;e the <HI>Knight of the burning Sword</HI> went forth of the Chamber, to meet tho&s;e, whom <HI>Fran|damella</HI> had been to fetch, whom he &s;aw at the Lake, pur&s;uing the Giante&s;s, but &s;he &s;o infe&s;ted them with her Arrows, that one of them fell down dead, at which the others, extremely vext, entred &s;o far into the Lake, that they thought, they &s;hould not get out again. Then this She-Devil let fly her A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">rows, with one of which &s;he pierc't a Ste<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">d into the Head &s;o that he tumbled down into the Water, carrying his Ma&s;ter along with him, which &s;o terrified the re&s;t, t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">at they began to draw back. Now the Queen and <HI>Lucella</HI> beheld this Sport through the Window of the Tower, which the Giante&s;s &s;eeing, let fly at them with &s;uch fury, that the Arrow hit again&s;t the middle of the Bar, without doing them any hurt, whereat they were a&s;toni&s;h'd, as was al&s;o the <HI>Knight of the Burning Sword,</HI> who was then underneath, the Ar|row falling at his Feet, which &s;o irritated him, that reproaching tho&s;e, who for fear of death had left the Giante&s;s in Peace, he forc'd them to return to the A&s;&s;ault. Then the Old Woman well knew, that &s;he &s;hould ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">e enough to do, and yet re&s;ol|ving rather to dye, than to fall into their hands, &s;ho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;o ta&s;t at them, that &s;he mor|tally wounded two of the mo&s;t likely among&s;t them, and then went &s;o far into the Water, that twas impo&s;&s;ible for them to get near her, unle&s;s they &s;wam: Which neverthele&s;s one, more adventurous than the re&s;t, attempted, but as he thought to joyn her, &s;he, rai&s;ing her &s;elf a Tip-toe, gave his Steed &s;uch a blow with her Semiter between his two ears, that Hor&s;e and Man &s;ank down to the Bottom, not being any more &s;een.</P>
<P>By this the <HI>Knight of the burning Sword</HI> well knew, that he &s;hould never have her without &s;ome other Artifice: Wherefore he made them all Retire, and hoping to gain by words what he could not get by Arms, &s;peak to her in this manner: <HI>Lady, give us the Keys of the Tower, and I promi&s;e you on the faith of a Gentleman that you &s;hall not receive any di&s;plea&s;ure; otherwi&s;e your Daughter &s;hall pay her Head for your Folly.</HI></P>
<P>But &s;he made no account either of his Prayers or Threats: wherefore the Knight return'd to the Ca&s;tle, and the re&s;t with him, there to find out with the King, &s;ome better Expedient: for the Queen and her Daughter were almo&s;t fami&s;ht; nor could they tell how to give them any Victuals.</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P>How the <HI>Knight of the Burning Sword</HI> &s;lew the Giante&s;s, Wife to <HI>Frandalon</HI> the <HI>Cyclops,</HI> and fell in love with the fair <HI>Lucella,</HI> for whom he did afterwards many high Feats of Arms.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>NIght being come, and the Knights betaking them&s;elves to their Repo&s;e, the King, who&s;e Thoughts were ruminating on his Queen, and Daughter, that remain'd &s;till &s;hut up without Food, or any means of being &s;peedily &s;uccor'd, had not yet clos'd his Eyes, when he heard the Voice of one, who cry'd out for fear: Where|fore &s;uddainly &s;tarting up, he call'd out to the <HI>Knight of the Burning Sword,</HI> &s;aying&punc; <HI>As I live, my dear Friend, I am greatly mi&s;taken, if they are not outraging the Queen: for I have heard a great cry.</HI></P>
<P>At this the Knight ro&s;e ha&s;tily up, and taking his Sword in one hand, and a Flambeau in the other, ran to the Place, where he heard the Noi&s;e, and, as he was going down the &s;tairs, &s;aw the Giante&s;s, who carried the Queen, and her Daughter under her two Arms, flying with all the &s;peed &s;he could toward the Lake. And the the Burthen was very heavy, yet &s;he made &s;uch ha&s;t, that he could not overtake her, till &s;he was gotten up to the knees in the Water: But then he &s;o &s;urpriz'd her, that &s;he never more parted thence, but immediately dy'd, letting the Queen and <HI>Lucella</HI> fall into the Water, of which they at that time Drank more than they did of Wine, In the mean time came the others, whom the King had likewi&s;e <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ak'd, and that ju&s;t in the nick, as the <HI>Knight of the Burning Sword</HI> was hard put to it, to &s;ave the Mo|ther and the Daughter. Thus were the Ladies a&s;&s;i&s;ted, and whil&s;t tho&s;e, that came la&s;t, took up the Queen, he carry'd <HI>Lucella</HI> to Land, who&s;e Elegancy and excellent Beauty gain'd &s;uch power over him, that he found him&s;elf &s;eiz'd with Love, a thing very new to him, who had never till then experimented the force of that little god, who neverthele&s;s treated him with &s;o much Gentlene&s;s, (tho' contrary to his Cu|&s;tom) that at the &s;ame time he inclin'd the heart of the Prince&s;s to a Reciprocal af|fection, making her no le&s;s de&s;irous, than de&s;ired. Neverthele&s;s both the one and the other with great Prudence and Di&s;cretion carefully conceal'd this Pa&s;&s;ion, tho' the <HI>Knight of the burning Sword</HI> had no &s;ooner freed her out of Danger, and &s;et her on firm Land, but (making her a great Reverence) he askt her, how &s;he did.</P>
<P><HI>Alas! Sir,</HI> &s;aid &s;he, <HI>my heart beats &s;o vehemently, that I know not, whether I am dead, or living: For GOD's &s;ake conduct me to the King, and tell me whether he be much wounded: for when I &s;aw him ye&s;terday, I was in great doubt of his &s;afety.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Madam,</HI> an&s;wer'd the Knight, <HI>he is certainly wounded, but not &s;o much, as you may think, and the Joy, he will receive by your pre&s;ence, will make him for|get the greate&s;t part of his pain.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Indeed Sir,</HI> reply'd <HI>Lucella, you have &s;o much oblig'd us, that we are bound to

<P><HI>Ma am,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>I &s;hall e&s;teem my &s;elf the happie&s;t man in the World, if you graciou&s;ly accept the little I have done for your deliverance, &s;ince I am &s;o much yours, that under your &s;ole Favour I re&s;olve henceforth to follow Arms, and no o|therwi&s;e, giving my &s;elf the Glory to be &s;ervant to the faire&s;t Prince&s;s, this day living.</HI></P>
<P>Vttering this word, he felt the new Di&s;temper of love &s;o &s;trong, that, had the Night b&eacute;en clearer, his Coulor might have been &s;een to change ten times in one In|&s;tant. He would have &s;aid more, but the others who had a&s;&s;i&s;ted the Queen, approacht, and they went together towards the Ca&s;tle, where they were met by <HI>Frandamella,</HI> who with great Ioy ca&s;t her &s;elf at the Queens Feet, by whom &s;he was graciou&s;ly ta|ken up and emb<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">ac't: for the Queen greatly lov'd her for the &s;ake of <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">ri&s;tion</HI> her Fa|ther, who was Governor of <HI>Sicily,</HI> when <HI>Alpatracy</HI> and &s;he were di&s;enchanted. Then they A&s;cended the Stairs, and went into the Room where the King lay &s;ick, who &s;eeing the Queen and <HI>Lucella</HI> in good Health, was (as you may believe) &s;o fill'd with Ioy, that his Speech fail'd him, and &s;tretching out his Arms, as the&s;e two Ladies paid him their Re&s;pects, he embrac'd them, the one with his right hand, the other with his left, the Tears falling abundantly down his Cheeks.</P>
<P>Then all of a &s;uddain fetching a deep &s;igh, he lifted up his Eyes to Heaven, and cry'd out: <HI>O Soveraign GOD! prais'd be your holy Name! &s;ince it has plea&s;ed you, after having deliver'd us out of the cur&s;ed Conjuration and Enchantment, in which the Sorcere&s;s</HI> Medea <HI>had put us, to grant me this farther Ble&s;&s;ing, that I &s;hould this day &s;ee with my eyes the two per&s;ons, that are dearer to me than my own life.

On my faith we are &s;o much oblig'd to you, that we may with rea&s;on call you our &s;econd Father, as having given us a new life: &s;ince without your A&s;&s;i&s;tance we had been certainly lo&s;t, the&s;e Ladies with ill U&s;age, and I with Di&s;content.</HI></P>
<P>Now the Queen and <HI>Lucella</HI> had not eaten any thing in two days: Wherefore the <HI>Knight of the burning Sword,</HI> &s;eeing that the King was entring into a Di&s;cour&s;e, which was like to hold him long, interpo&s;s'd, &s;aying: <HI>Sir, your new Content makes you forget the long Time, that the&s;e Ladies have been without Food. Does it not plea&s;e you, that &s;ome Victuals be brought them?</HI></P>
<P><HI>I be&s;eech you, let it be &s;o,</HI> an&s;wer'd he: <HI>for I believe they have very great need.</HI></P>
<P>Then were the Tables cover'd, and in the mean time the Queen recited the fear, &s;he was in, till &s;uch time &s;he &s;aw the Giante&s;s dead.</P>
<P><HI>And who &s;lew her?</HI> &s;aid the King.</P>
<P><HI>Sir,</HI> an&s;wer'd &s;he, &s;hewing him the <HI>Knight of the Burning Sword, this Gentle|man cleft her Head in two, and &s;he remain'd bury'd in the Mud of the Lake.</HI></P>
<P><HI>She's very well lodg'd,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>GOD, or the Devil will henceforth treat her as &s;he has de&s;erv'd.</HI></P>
<PB N="75" REF="44">
<P>In the&s;e and other Di&s;cour&s;es they pa&s;s'd the Time till the <HI>Knight of the Bur|ning Sword</HI> bad the King and the Ladies good Night, for to retire till Day into ano|ther Chamber, where, in&s;tead of Sleeping, he threw him&s;elf cloath'd as he was, up|on a Field-Bed, and having before the eyes of his &s;oul, the Beauty of his new Mi|&s;tre&s;s, entred into &s;o profound a Cogitation, that he even forgot him&s;elf: Neverthe|le&s;s after he had &s;ufficiently tumbled both on the left &s;ide, and the right, he fetcht a deep &s;igh, and remembring the Threat, that <HI>Urganda</HI> made him by the Letter &s;he left him at his going out of Great <HI>Britain,</HI> began to &s;ay within him&s;elf: <HI>Alas, Wi&s;e Prophete&s;s, I now well perceive, that the Adverti&s;ement, you gave me, is true: for the very day, that my Lady came forth of Pri&s;on, I was &s;o made her Captive and Slave, that I have nothing in me free, or that is not &s;ubjected to her. Ah, ah! poor</HI> Knight of the Burning Sword! <HI>Ha&s;t thou then hopes ever to receive cure?

<P>Then all of a &s;uddain changing his Opinion, he &s;aid: <HI>But perhaps I am de&s;cended of &s;uch a Lineage, that I ought not to have &s;o mean a conceit of my &s;elf; and my Heart's taking &s;o high a Flight is an Argument, to make me believe that my Father was a Gentleman, and that it merits &s;omething.

<ARGUMENT>
<P>Of a Wonderful Adventure, that befel the King of <HI>Sicily,</HI> the <HI>Knight of the Burning Sword,</HI> the Queen, <HI>Lucella,</HI> and <HI>Frandamella,</HI> by which they were &s;eparated from their Fleet, and in danger of being drown'd.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>SIx whole Weeks Sail'd King <HI>Alpatracy,</HI> and his Company, with &s;o favoura|ble a Wind, that all things went according to their Wi&s;h, and the King was &s;o carefully lookt after by his Chyrurgions, that his wounds were wholly Cur'd. But that of the <HI>Knight of the Burning &s;word</HI> grew daily wor&s;e and wor&s;e, &s;eeing &s;o near him (and yet &s;o much out of his Command) <HI>Lucella,</HI> whom he mo&s;t affectionately lov'd: and what yet more griev'd him, was, that the Queen never let her be out of her &s;ight. Thus had they not any means to Confer familiarly with one another, but liv'd in hopes, that Place and Time would one day afford them a better conveni|ency. And in the mean time their &s;ole Delight was to di&s;cour&s;e together, conten|ting their Affections with Amorous Glan&s;es, &s;hot from their Eyes, which
<PB N="77" REF="45"> often carry'd News to their pa&s;&s;ionate Hearts, of what they mo&s;t de&s;ir'd.</P>
<P>In this manner they continu'd their Courte, till one Evening about Sun-&s;et, they di&s;cover'd within a League of them a little I&s;land, which &s;eem'd to them &s;o plea|&s;antly planted with Trees, and water'd with an Infinity of little Rivers, that the Queen, weary of the Sea, de&s;ir'd the King to Land there, and refre&s;h them, which was no di&s;agreeable Reque&s;t. He therefore caus'd a Boat to be let down into the Sea, into which He and the Queen went, accompany'd only by <HI>Lucelia, Frandamella,</HI> and the <HI>Knight of the burning Sword,</HI> who took his Arms, as the King al&s;o did, together with their Steeds, to defend them&s;elves, if any Adventure &s;hould give them occa&s;ion. Then <HI>Frandamella,</HI> who &s;erv'd for Pilot, &s;et her &s;elf to row, for &s;he had heretofore handled the Oar, for Diverti&s;ment. By means whereof &s;he in a moment carry'd them off from the Principal Ship, which the King comman|ded in the mean time to ride at Anchor, intending to make a &s;peedy Return.</P>
<P>They had not Sail'd long, e're driven and ma&s;ter'd by the Wind, they came within a Bow &s;hot of a very high Rock: high and &s;teep I may well call it, for it in a man|ner toucht the Clouds, and was cut either by Nature, or with &s;uch Artifice, that it &s;eem'd to have pa&s;s'd the Hatcher or Chi&s;el. On the Top were an Old Woman and an Old Man, holding each other by the Collar, and wre&s;tling with &s;o much Agility, that at every turn the one, or the other, appear'd likely to be thrown. And in fine they mutually tript up each other with &s;o great Violence, that they both without let|ting go their hold fell into the bottom of the Sea, and immediately al&s;o the Rock &s;ank with &s;uch an Emotion and Tempe&s;t, that the Waves &s;well'd up with &s;o great a Contrariety of Winds, that the Boat which was guided by <HI>Frandamella,</HI> was above an hundred times tover'd with Water, and ready to be &s;wallow'd up, greatly terrify|ing them, and taking from them all hopes of ever getting to Shore, for their guide was &s;o a&s;toni&s;ht, that abandoning Rudder, Oar, and whatever was &s;erviceable to them, &s;he fell down without &s;tirring either Hand or Foot.</P>
<P>This when <HI>Lucella</HI> &s;aw, trembling like the leaf of the Tree, &s;he knew no better Place of Security, than the Arms of her Knight, into which, as her la&s;t Refuge, &s;he ca&s;t her &s;elf. Then (tho' the Inclemency of the Weather pre&s;ented them with &s;o Evident a Danger) this Favor of his Mi&s;tre&s;s was &s;o agreeable to him, that, as one Nail drives out another, he forgot the Peril of Shipwrack; to let her under&s;tand that, in which his life was through the exce&s;s of his love, unle&s;s &s;he took pity of his Per&s;on. For the obtaining of which he began to make her this Remon&s;trance: <HI>Ma|dam, I humbly be&s;eech you to believe, that the Rigor of this Sea cannot be &s;o cruel or dreadful to me, as is the Violence of that Flame, which con&s;umes me, who love you with &s;uch an Affection, that none but my &s;elf can feel, or comprehend, unle&s;s he will mea&s;ure it by the Greatne&s;s and Excellence of your Beauty: And in this ca&s;e every per&s;on of good Judgment will bear me witne&s;s, that tho' I &s;hould dy an hun|dred times a day, yet would not the&s;e Deaths be &s;ufficient to merit the lea&s;t Favour of your good Grace.

<P>The&s;e Remon&s;trances were intermixt with Sighs, accompany'd with &s;uch abun|dance of Tears, that the Fore-part of his Armor was all wet with them.

<P>THe Boat, in which was the King the Queen, the <HI>Knight of the Burning Sword, Lucella</HI> and <HI>Frandamella,</HI> was all that day, and the night following, in won|derful danger, and yet more the next morning: For it &s;pilt upon a Sand, adjoining

And tho' the Countrey was unknown to them, and that they &s;aw neither Path, nor Way, to get up; yet they thought them&s;elves much better among&s;t the Shrubs and Briars, than amid&s;t the Rage and Tempe&s;t of that mercile&s;s Sea, where they had been &s;o much tormented. Now Neee&s;&s;ity, which is, as every one knows, the Mi&s;tre&s;s of Arts, made them &s;earch diligently about, till they found a Path, a little beaten, and frequented.</P>
<P>Then the <HI>Knight of the Burning Sword</HI> &s;aid to the King; <HI>Sir, I think, it would be be&s;t, that we &s;hould go up, and &s;ee, if we can di&s;cover any Hou&s;e, or Cottage, where we may get Shelter.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Well, let us go then,</HI> an&s;wer'd he.</P>
<P>So they all took hor&s;e, and climb'd up, till they di&s;cover'd the Tops of certain Buildings, towards which they rode, &s;o that about the clo&s;ing of the Evening they might ea&s;ily &s;ee the Fortre&s;s, which was a great &s;quare Ca&s;tle, environ'd with thick Walls, having Battlements, and being in good Defence. But before they could come near it, they &s;aw at a good di&s;tance two great Marble Pillars, where there began a Wall which went to a very fair Tower, and thence to another about a Bow-&s;hoot off where were likewi&s;e two Pillars and &s;o to four more, each at a Bow-&s;hoot Di&s;tance from the la&s;t, before it, and thence to the Ca&s;tle, which compleated the number of &s;even. But they &s;aw neither Man, nor Woman, of whom they might enquire con|cerning the Place, which made them certainly believe it to be uninhabited. Never|thele&s;s con&s;idering the Danger out of which they were ju&s;t e&s;cap't, nothing could pre&s;ent it &s;elf to their Eyes, which &s;eem'd capable to offend them. They went on therefore, till they came to an high erected Pillar of Cry&s;tal, on the Top of which was a great gilt Statue; repre&s;enting the Per&s;on of a Queen, holding in her left hand a Roll, &s;o long, that it reacht down to the Ba&s;is of the Pillar, wherein, with excellent artifice were graven certain <HI>Caldean</HI> Characters, to which &s;he pointed with her Right.

<P>This was very agr&eacute;eable to the Ladies: wherefore they Alighted, and (unbrid|ling their Hor&s;es, to let them feed,) &s;at down at the Foot of the Pillar, where they had not long been, when there came towards them a very Ancient Gentleman, hav|ing a Faulcon on his Fi&s;t.

<P>Then bidding them good night, he &s;pur'd towards the Ca&s;tle, leaving them in great doubt, and ready to take another way, if they could tell how; but the <HI>Knight of the burning Sword</HI> &s;topt them, telling the King, that, &s;ince there was but one Guard in each Tower, they ought to try their Fortune: <HI>For I hope,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>that with the help of our gods we &s;hall defeat them, and have the Place at our Command, before</HI> Axiana <HI>returns.

<P>And to &s;ay Truth, they wept, like Per&s;ons in de&s;pair, which gave the King bet|ter occa&s;ion to believe the Knight recommending their Fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">tune to his P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">owe&s;s: and for this cau&s;e the King told him that he believ'd him, and that, as &s;oon as it was day, they two would take Hor&s;e, to go and fight the Guards, whil&s;t the Ladies re|pos'd them&s;elves.

</ARGUMENT>
<P>THus they pa&s;s'd a great part of the Night, till &s;uch time as the day began to ap|pear. Then they all took Hor&s;e, and the Knights making them&s;elves ready for the Com<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">at, marcht on to the fir&s;t Tower; and, as they went, the <HI>Knight of the burning &s;word</HI> be&s;ought the King, that &s;ince they were to fight the Guards one after another, he would be pleas'd not to enter into fight, as long as him&s;elf, &s;hould have Ability to re&s;i&s;t them: which the King willingly granted him. Whil&s;t they were di&s;cour&s;ing thus, they came to a very deep River, over which was a Bridge of Wood, whereby they were to pa&s;s into the fir&s;t Tower. Then they pre&s;ently heard an Ho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">n &s;ound, and perceiv'd a Knight of immen&s;e Bigne&s;s come forth, mounted on a marvellous &s;trong Steed, who from the Entrance of the Bridge, call'd out to him <HI>of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter"> burning Sword,</HI> (for he march'd before the King) &s;aying: <HI>Sir Knight, leave your Arms, and come without con&s;traint into my Pri&s;on, el&s;e I will make both you, and your Companion, lo&s;e your Heads.</HI></P>
<P>But he an&s;wer'd not a word to all the&s;e Threats, &s;o that running one again&s;t a|nother, they met with &s;o much violence on the Bridge, that their Staves breaking, the Knight of the Tower and his Steed were tumbled into the River, whence the Hor&s;e at la&s;t got out, leaving his Ma&s;ter in the bottom, who never in the lea&s;t com|plain'd of it. And the <HI>Knight of the burning Sword</HI> marching on, the Watch, who had &s;ounded the Horn, made a great cry and went off.</P>
<P>Then the King and the Ladies, which accompany'd the <HI>Knight of the burning Sword,</HI> drew near, and pa&s;s'd the Tower together, at coming out of which they heard another Horn &s;ound from the next Fortre&s;s. This they rightly thought to be the calling forth of the Guard to the Combat: wherefore the <HI>Knight of the burning Sword</HI> went to meet him: and when they were within a Career of one another, the Knight of the Tower, riding on a great black Hor&s;e, cry'd out as loud as he could: <HI>Yield your &s;elf, poor Wretch, and re&s;olve to &s;uffer perpetual impri&s;onment, and Hunger: for by you has my Companion lo&s;t his Life, as we have under&s;tood by the cry of the Watch.</HI></P>
<P>Now the <HI>Knight of the burning &s;word</HI> had gotten the King's Lance, wherefore hold<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ng him&s;elf more &s;ecure, he thus an&s;wer'd the other: <HI>By my Head, Sir Knight, i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter"> your Companion be dead, &s;o much the wor&s;e for him: and becau&s;e He, who
<PB N="83" REF="48"> thinks to revenge anothers Di&s;grace, very often increa&s;es his own, I am of opini|on, that you &s;hould forbear any farther Threats, and think of defending your &s;elf again&s;t me.</HI></P>
<P>Then they Spur'd one again&s;t the other, and their meeting was &s;uch, that the Guard break his Spear on his Enemies Shield, who, having better taken his Aim, pierc'd him quite thro' the Body, &s;o that he fell dead on the Gra&s;s. Which the &s;econd Watch &s;eeing, made the like Cry with the former, and then di&s;appear'd, whil&s;t the King and the Ladies approacht the Tower, which they found &s;hut; but the Keys hanging in an Iron Chain by the Gate, they open'd it.</P>
<P>They were &s;carce entred when the third Watch, &s;ounding as the two former had done, call'd them forth to meet the next Guard, who was ready for the Combat: Wherefore the <HI>Knight of the burning Sword</HI> advancing, &s;o coming from far, a great Giant, arm'd in very &s;trong Armor, having two Steel Maces, one upon his Shoul|der, and the other at his Saddle-Bow, who, before they met &s;peak thus to the <HI>Knight of the burning Sword: Knight, the Combat between thee and me is (according to the Cu&s;tom of this Tower) to be perform'd with Maces: wherefore take, which of the&s;e two thou wilt, and think of doing thy Devoir: neverthele&s;s if thou wilt yield to my Will, I &s;hall perhaps have mercy on thy Per&s;on, which is in &s;o great Danger.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Certainly,</HI> reply'd the <HI>Knight of the burning &s;word, I will fir&s;t &s;ee how thou can&s;t &s;trike: for I never had a De&s;ire, or Thought to receive Mercy of &s;uch, Per&s;o|nages, as thou art.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Well, choo&s;e then;</HI> Said the Gyant, pre&s;enting him the two Maces, of which the Knight took that, he lik't be&s;t, and immediatly they began in a&s;&s;ault each other with &s;uch Fury, that at the two fir&s;t Blows they both fell down, as dead: Where<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">re the Watch of the third Tower ca&s;t forth a louder and more pitiful Cry, than any of the re&s;t, and incontinently ab&s;ented. <HI>Lucella</HI> then certainly thought, that &s;he had lo&s;t her Love, at which &s;he &s;o exceedingly, tho' inwardly, griev'd, as to wi&s;h her &s;elf dead; when &s;he &s;aw him get up again, and run upon the Gyant, whom he thought to be only &s;tunny'd. But his Condition was much wor&s;e: For his two Eyes were &s;tarted out of his Head, and his life wholly gone. Then the King brought the Con|queror his Hor&s;e, and the Ladies drew near, to know, how he did.</P>
<P><HI>So well,</HI> an&s;wer'd he, <HI>that I have no Hurt, to hinder my pa&s;&s;ing on, if nothing wor&s;e befalls me.</HI></P>
<P><HI>In good faith</HI> &s;aid the Queen, <HI>if you continue, as you have begun, you will with good right gain the Name of the be&s;t, and happie&s;t Knight; that ever was.</HI></P>
<P>Saying this, they pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">s'd the Tower, and the Watch of the fourth &s;ounded, as the others had done. Then of a &s;udden there pre&s;ented him&s;elf a Knight of a wonderful Stature, having his Head like to that of an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Ma&s;tiff, his Armor being a Shirt of Mail, with a great and &s;trong Shield, a Semiter by his Side, a Bow in his Hand, and at his Back a Quiver, hangingfull of Arrows, one of which he held r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ady to &s;hoot. And becau&s;e he was of an I&s;le, nam'd <HI>Cynocephalia,</HI> where all the

And thus &s;triking on the right hand, and the left, the <HI>Knight of the Burning Sword,</HI> &s;orry, and a&s;ham'd at &s;o long a Delay of his Victory, e&s;pecially in the pre&s;ence of his Lady and Mi&s;tre&s;s, &s;tept forward, and lift|ing up his Arm, as if he would &s;trike the <HI>Cynocephal</HI> on the Top of his Head, &s;eiz'd with his left hand on his Shield, which he pull'd to him with &s;o much &s;trength, that plucking it from his Neck, he brought him with his No&s;e to the Ground. Never|thele&s;s he &s;uddenly got up again, and thinking to revenge him&s;elf, let fall his Semiter with all the force, he could, at the <HI>Knight of the Burning Sword;</HI> but he &s;tepping a&s;ide, avoided the Blow, and as he turn'd, gave the Dogs-face &s;uch a Thru&s;t in his Throat, as cut his Wind-pipe: At which the Watch of the fifth Tower won|dering, wound his Horn, and crying out with a piteous voice; di&s;appear'd, whil&s;t the King and the Ladies advanc'd, doubting their Knight to be more wounded, then he was.</P>

The Blood was no &s;ooner &s;topt, but the Guard of the fifth Tower pre&s;ented him&s;elf, no le&s;s furious than the re&s;t, for be&s;ides that he was a Gi|ant of a very fierce Counteance, he would have the Combat to be with Axes, bring|ing for that purpo&s;e two upon his Shoulders, of which he gave the choi&s;e to the <HI>Knight of the Burning Sword,</HI> who, in fine, di&s;comfited him, and the Sentinel &s;ounded after|wards as the former had done.</P>
<P>The fifth Tower being then conquer'd, and the King with his Train having pa&s;s'd there came forth of the &s;ixth a young Knight, about thirty years old, having no o|ther Arms, but a &s;word and a Cloak, with which he hop'd to defend, what he was ap|pointed to. Then he marcht towards him, who had already Conquer'd &s;o much, and at his approach began to &s;ay to him: <HI>Certainly, Sir Knight, you ought in rea&s;on to be much e&s;teem'd having defeated five &s;uch, that it is difficult to find their Equals: And to &s;hew the Truth of it, it is not within the Memory of Man, that ever any, be&s;ides your&s;elf, got by force to the third Tower: but &s;ince Fortune has been &s;o favourable to you, and you are, as I &s;ee, re&s;olv'd to follow it, you mu&s;t ob&s;erve the Conditi|ons requir'd in this place, which are &s;uch. The Combat between us two is to be with Sword and Cloak, without any other Arms whatever: Therefore
<PB N="85" REF="49"> you may well ea&s;e your &s;elf of all this Armor, which is, I believe, very burden|&s;om to you.</HI></P>
<P>Now the <HI>Knight of the Burning Sword</HI> was excellently well skil'd in fencing, and for this cau&s;e not willing to refu&s;e the others Offer, made him this An&s;wer: <HI>In good faith I am di&s;pleas'd at the Death of your Companions, tho' you cannot but know, that it was not &s;o much thro' my Fault, as their own, and the perver&s;e Cu&s;tom of this Place, for which I am &s;orry, that if you think &s;it to leave it at pre&s;ent, with|out con&s;training me any farther to fight, a&s;&s;ure your &s;elf, you will lay an Obligation on me for ever. For, be&s;ides that you &s;eem to me a valiant man, you have in the beginning &s;o prais'd me, that I know not, what Thanks to give you.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Truly,</HI> &s;aid the other, <HI>were I Ma&s;ter of my &s;elf, our Accord would be ea&s;ily made: but I have given my Faith to her, that brought me into the&s;e Coa&s;ts, to defend the Tower to my death. And <HI>I</HI> was indeed much &s;urpriz'd, when I oblig'd my &s;elf to it: For &s;he askt me a Gift, which I granted her, without knowing what, whereof I have had lei&s;ure enough to repent me.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Since it is &s;o,</HI> an&s;wer'd the <HI>Knight of the Burning Sword, I would not for any thing de&s;ire ought of you, that may blemi&s;h your Honor.</HI></P>
<P>Then he call'd <HI>Frandamella</HI> to help him off with his Harne&s;s, of which, when he was deve&s;ted, the Knight of the Ca&s;tle, &s;eeing him &s;o fair, and well-proportion'd, con|ceiv'd a very great E&s;teem for him. Now he wanted a Cloak or Mantle: but <HI>Lu|cella,</HI> who heard all the Di&s;cour&s;e, &s;ent him hers by the Dam&s;el, whom &s;he charg'd in her Name to de&s;ire him, that he would for her &s;a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">e be very careful to defend him&s;elf.</P>
<P><Q REND="margQuotes">It is for you, perfect Lovers, to judge, how great Plea&s;ure his Soul then re|ceiv'd: Did not Love then do much for him, manife&s;ting to him at that time, and &s;o apparently, the Good &s;he de&s;ir'd him, for whom he dy'd day and night? Truly you mu&s;t confefs, that this &s;ole Favour was &s;ufficient to in&s;pire him with &s;o much Courage, as he would not only have dar'd to fight the Gentleman, that a&s;&s;ail'd him; but even <HI>Atlas</HI> him&s;elf, nay the very Giants, which <HI>Jupiter</HI> enclos'd in the hollow Mountains, he over turn'd upon them.</Q></P>
<P>This he well let be under&s;tood by the An&s;wer he made <HI>Frandamella,</HI> &s;aying, <HI>M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter"> dear Friend, &s;ince my Lady has had &s;uch Remembrance of me this precious Mantle &s;hall not part from my Arm, till either the Honour of the Combat be holy granted me, or Death &s;eparate my Soul from my Body, which in this world is only to obey her, as the faire&s;t, di&s;creete&s;t, and mo&s;t virtuous Prince&s;s on the Earth.</HI></P>
<P>Scarce had he utter'd this word, when the Dam&s;el retir'd: for the Knight of the Ca&s;tle would proceed to the Combat which was between them the mo&s;t gallant that ever was &s;een.

However they continu'd long, and many Blows and Thru&s;ts pa&s;s'd betwixt them, without ever coming to the quick, &s;o valiant, vigilant, and dextrous they were. And tho' he of the Tower us'd much Artifice, and made many fal&s;e O&s;iers, to end<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="4 letters">a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">e,
<PB N="86" REF="50"> and &s;urpri&s;e the other; yet could he not in the lea&s;t injure him, nor yet &s;o much as touch his Cloak, which he guarded and defended, more than his own Per&s;on: where|at his Enemy being irritated, as thinking he di&s;dain'd him, &s;tept forward, and in &s;tep|ping lifted up his Arm to cleave his Head, which the <HI>Knight of the burning Sword</HI> &s;o well obviated, that falling back, he made an offer of giving his Adver&s;ary a Thru&s;t directly in the Brea&s;t, but letting fall his Arm, gave him &s;uch a cut in the Leg, as brought him to the ground, being not able to &s;tand any longer: wherefore he cry'd out: <HI>Ah, ah, Knight! &s;ince &s;ucce&s;s is &s;o much at your command, pa&s;s on, and fol|low your Fortune.</HI></P>
<P>And as he would have &s;poken more, the Watch of the next Tower (in&s;tead of win|ding his Horn, as the others had done) made a great Exclamation, crying out: <HI>Come forth Soldiers, come forth, or we are all lo&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Knight of the burning Sword</HI> then well thought, that he &s;hould now find more to do, than he had done hitherto: wherefore he came to <HI>Lucella,</HI> and putting his knee to the ground, gave her her Cloak, as whole, as he had receiv'd it from <HI>Frandamella,</HI> &s;aying to her: <HI>Here, Madam, is, what you lent me, which I have to the utmo&s;t of my Power defended again&s;t my Enemies Sword, to &s;hew, how dear I e&s;teem what|ever comes from you.</HI></P>
<P>Then he ha&s;tily took his Arms: for, he already <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">eard the Noi&s;e and Bu&s;tle of tho&s;e that were coming forth, whom he in&s;tantly receiv'd, being &s;ix arm'd, and accoucred Knights, and four Servants, having Habergeons, and Head-pieces of Iron, who all ran together upon him. Then began a Fight of ten again&s;t one; but the King would take a Pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ty, and fell in among&s;t them, like one, whom the matter nearly con|cern'd. Which the four Slaves &s;eeing, they went a&s;ide, and &s;eiz'd on the Ladies, whom, notwith&s;tanding all their Cr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">s and Lamentations, they carry'd into the For|tre&s;s. Which caus'd &s;uch a Fury in the two a&s;&s;aulted Knights, that &s;paring neither their Skin, nor their Fle&s;h, four of the others fell dead in the place, the two, that remain'd, flying with all &s;peed to &s;ave their lives; but they were &s;oon overtaken, and Treated like their Companions.</P>
<P>Thus the King and the Knight entred into the Tower, into which they had &s;een the Ladies carry'd, whom they found not there: and for this cau&s;e the went towards the &s;eventh, near which they met the four Villains, returning from their Enterprize, to a&s;&s;i&s;t tho&s;e, that were a&s;&s;aulted, but whatever Re&s;i&s;tance they could make, the two principal of them were &s;lain on the Place, and the others taken to Mercy, on Promi&s;e of declaring, what they had done with the Queen and her Company. Now as they were going into the Ca&s;tle, the <HI>Knight of the burning Sword</HI> &s;eeing that the la&s;t Guard did not appear, as the other had done, enquir'd of the Villains, where he was.</P>
<P><HI>My Lords,</HI> an&s;wer'd one of them, the Infant Ariana <HI>our Prince&s;s, who Inti|mately loves him, has taken him within the&s;e few dayes an hunting, and we were told ye&s;terday by one, who came from them, that they would be here this day, or to morrow at farthe&s;t.

<P>So long continu'd they this Di&s;cour&s;e, till they came into a lower Hall, where they found the Queen, her Daughter, and the Dam&s;el, ty'd with great Co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ds, and more dead, then living: But their Fear was &s;oon over, when they perceiv'd the King and the <HI>Knight of the Burning Sword,</HI> who incontinently unbound t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">em.

<P>The &s;ervants having done, what he commanded them retir'd.

<HEAD>CHAP. XXIV.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>How the <HI>Knight of the Burning Sword</HI> went up to the Chamber of Trea&s;ure, where the <HI>Emperor</HI> of <HI>Trebi&s;ond, L<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;vart</HI> of <HI>Greece,</HI> and <HI>Perion</HI> of <HI>Gaul</HI> were Enchanted: And what befel them.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THe <HI>Knight of the burning Sword,</HI> having two &s;everal Wounds, one in his Leg, made by <HI>Cynocephals</HI> Arrow, the other in his Heart, by <HI>Lucella's</HI> Beauty, could not take any re&s;t for the Light of the Tapers that were burning in the Chamber: But a&s;&s;oon as they were extinct, thinking by the Help of the Darkne&s;s to clo&s;e his Eyes, there came &s;uch a Brightne&s;s from the Stair-ca&s;e, we lately mention'd, as made him &s;uddenly &s;tart up: And doubting &s;ome Trea&s;on, he ha&s;tily took his Hel|met, and his Shield, and with his Sword in hand going &s;trait to the Place, whence this great Light proceeded, he began to a&s;cend the Steps towards the <HI>Chamber of Trea&s;ure,</HI> till he came under a Perron, &s;upported by &s;even Pillars of Iarinth, &s;o tran&s;parent and &s;hining, that he ea&s;ily perceiv'd in each of them an Image of Gold, &s;o curiou&s;ly wrought, that they wanted nothing but Life.</P>
<P>Two of the&s;e repre&s;ented the Effigies of Men, and all the Re&s;t of Women: Who&s;e Robes were &s;o cover'd with Diamonds, and other precious &s;tones, that from the Splen|dor of them i&s;&s;u'd &s;uch a Light, as twenty Torches could not have yielded a greater. Now each &s;tatue had in its left hand a Roll of Gold with Latin Letters, and with the Right pointed to the Walls, towards which their Faces were turn'd, whereon were painted with marvelous Artifice certain Hi&s;tories, which I am going to re|hear&s;e to you.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t &s;tatue, repre&s;enting a Man, had on his Head an Imperial Crown, and in his Roll were written the&s;e Words:</P>
<P><HI>Apolidon, <HI>Emperor of</HI> Con&s;tantinople, <HI>the mo&s;t excellent of all Magicians, that ever were.</HI></HI></P>
<P>The Hi&s;tories, he pointed to with with his right hand, were the Proof of the Ark of loyal Lovers, and the Defended Chamber, where <HI>Amadis</HI> and <HI>Oriana</HI> acquir'd greater Fame than all others, that attemted to enter. The Trial of the Sword and Gar|land, with the Kerchief, cover'd with Flowers, which this excellent King and Queen gain'd, as you find it di&s;crib'd in the &s;econd Book of <HI>Amadis</HI> of <HI>Gaul.</HI> Hard by was pictur'd, how <HI>Li&s;vart</HI> of <HI>Greece</HI> pluckt the Sword out of the Lyons Body before the Well Gate of <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> at &s;uch time as it was be&s;ieg'd by <HI>Armato,</HI> and tho&s;e of the <HI>Firm I&s;land</HI> were di&s;enchanted.</P>
<P>The next Statue was of a very ancient man, in who&s;e Roll were the following Words.</P>
<P><HI>Alquif, <HI>the great Philo&s;opher, more intelligent in&s;upernatural things, then any man in his time.</HI></HI></P>
<PB N="89" REF="51">
<P>The Hi&s;tories, he &s;hew'd painted on the oppo&s;ite Wall; were the Ship, govern'd by Apes, when he &s;ent to fetch the King of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> and tho&s;e, whom <HI>Urgan|da</HI> had &s;tay'd in the Palace of <HI>Apolidon</HI> by Force of her Conjurations: the manner, how he arriv'd at <HI>Fenu&s;a,</HI> where <HI>Perion</HI> of <HI>Gaul,</HI> and <HI>Li&s;vart</HI> of <HI>Greece</HI> (&s;urnam'd, the one the <HI>German,</HI> and the other the <HI>Solitary Knight</HI>) ju&s;ted again&s;t all Comers, and were by him di&s;cover'd, after they had a long time conceal'd them&s;elves.</P>
<P>Next to this on another Pillor, was the Image of a Queen, holding her Roll, on which was w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">itten:</P>
<P><HI>Medea, <HI>expert and skilful above all others in the Secrets of Nature.</HI></HI></P>
<P>The Painting over again&s;t her repre&s;ented King <HI>Alpatracy</HI> and his Wife enchan|ted, with the Helmet and Crown, gotten by <HI>Li&s;vart</HI> of <HI>Greece,</HI> and <HI>Onoloria,</HI> as is recorded in the &s;ixth Book of <HI>Amadis</HI> of <HI>Gaul.</HI></P>
<P>The next Statue was of a Woman, who&s;e Roll had the&s;e Words:</P>
<P><HI>I am the <HI>Dam&s;el Enchantre&s;s,</HI> who was &s;econd to none.</HI></P>
<P>The oppo&s;ite Painting &s;hew'd, how the Emperor <HI>E&s;plandian</HI> got the Sword, the Trea&s;ure, the Image of <HI>Jupiter,</HI> and the Lion, with the Tombs, as it is at large in the fifth Book of the &s;aid Hi&s;tory.</P>
<P>The next Image &s;hew'd an honourable Old Woman, wearing a Crown, in who&s;e Role was this Line:</P>
<P><HI>The Prince&s;s <HI>Melia,</HI> the mo&s;t exqui&s;ite Sorcere&s;s in the World.</HI></P>
<P>The Wall was painted with the Hi&s;tory of the Adventurous Fountain, where <HI>E&s;plandian</HI> found the Infanta <HI>Eliaxa;</HI> the manner, how the &s;aid <HI>Melia</HI> was, toge|ther with King <HI>Armato,</HI> brought Pri&s;oner into <HI>Con&s;tantinople;</HI> how the Dragons carry<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">d them, and <HI>Urganda</HI> the <HI>Unknown,</HI> away in a Chariot; al&s;o the Comet of the Flaming Sword, which &s;o long held all <HI>Thrace</HI> in fear, when <HI>Li&s;vart</HI> was Pri&s;oner.</P>
<P>The next Statue was al&s;o of an Ancient Woman, cloath'd like a Matron of that time and in the Writing, &s;he held, were the&s;e Words.</P>
<P><HI>Organda <HI>the mo&s;t wi&s;e Enchantre&s;s.</HI></HI></P>
<P>She directed to the Hi&s;tory of the Enchantment, made by her in the Ca&s;tle of <HI>Apo|lidon</HI> over the Kings <HI>Amadis, Galaor, Agraies,</HI> and other Princes, Lords, Ladies, and Gentlewomen, as you find it amply related in the fourth Book of the &s;aid Hi&s;to|ry. The Ship al&s;o of the Serpent, with the Frights, &s;he many times caus'd by her Arrival at the Port of <HI>Fenu&s;a.</HI></P>
<P>The &s;eventh and la&s;t Statue repre&s;ented the Effigies of a Queen, holding &s;o long a Roll, that it environ'd the whole Circumference of the <HI>Perron,</HI> having the&s;e words engraven in it;</P>
<P><HI>Zirfea, <HI>Queen of</HI> Argenes, <HI>Magician, a Lover of Knowledge, and of the Knowing in the Art, wherein I have been in&s;tructed, by which (to perpetuate my Memory) I have built this</HI> Perron, <HI>and what it contains, e&s;pecially to put Po&s;terity in admi|ration by the &s;trange Facts of tho&s;e, that are here repre&s;ented, who have neither before, nor &s;ince, had their Equals.</HI></HI></P>
<PB N="90" REF="52">
<P>With her other hand &s;he pointed to the Entrance of a Stair-ca&s;e, the &s;teps where of were of white Saphire, the Perron being all cover'd with Vine-work, the Leaves of which were of Gold, and the Grapes of Rubies, Diamonds, and Emeralds, with an infinite Number of &s;mall Birds, and little Creatures, &s;o curiou&s;ly wrought, that they &s;eem'd to have been forg'd by Nature her &s;elf.</P>
<P>The <HI>Knight of the Burning Sword</HI> took &s;o much Plea&s;ure in this place, that the longer he lookt, the le&s;s weary he was of looking, contemplating the Hi&s;torys, pain|ted about the Perron, mo&s;t of which he had often heard recounted in the Court of King <HI>Magaden.</HI> And as he was turning thus from one &s;ide to another, he e&s;py'd a great Lyon, &s;leeping clo&s;e by the latter Stair-ca&s;e, up which he went, and having A|&s;cended the fir&s;t four or five &s;teps, he perceiv'd a Portico, under which was a Door &s;hut, and all of a flaming Fire; neverthele&s;s there was a Dam&s;el leaning again&s;t it, who &s;eem'd to him of a Stature, above the common Proportion of others, but otherwi&s;e very fair, tho' her Countenance &s;eem'd full of Di&s;content, and deep Melancholly, for &s;he held her Head leaning upon her left hand, and in her right hand a naked Sword, from the Pommel of which proceeded a Brightne&s;s, like to that of the Planet <HI>Mars,</HI> when he is in his greate&s;t Vigor. And altho' &s;he had her Eyes &s;hut, like one in a &s;lumber, yet did the Tears trickle down her Face, and &s;he ever and anon fetch'd &s;uch deep &s;ighs, as &s;truck the <HI>Knight of the burning Sword</HI> with &s;o great wonder and com|pa&s;&s;ion, that addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to her, he &s;aid: <HI>Dam&s;el, I be&s;eech you, conceal not from me the Cau&s;e of your &s;orrow: for I a&s;&s;ure you if I can remedy it, you &s;hall find me ready to &s;erve you.</HI></P>
<P>At this word &s;he open'd her Eyes, and &s;eeing him &s;o near her, rous'd up her &s;elf, as one throughly frighted, an&s;wer'd him with great wrath: <HI>Ah! ra&s;h and prem&s;uptuous wretch! ha&s;t thou then dar'd to attempt the Coming up hither?

<P>Then &s;tretching out her Arm, &s;he gave him &s;uch a Blow with the Sword, as pierc't his Shield, Armor, and Body, to the very Hilt, the Knight falling all along on the Place. But then, as if &s;he were come to her &s;elf out of a deep Sleep, &s;he pre&s;ently cry'd out: <HI>O</HI> Iupitor! <HI>Alas what have I done?

<P>Then &s;itting on his knees, &s;he took the Knights Head in her Lap, and having fixt her Eye on it, her Sorrow grew &s;o &s;trong, as if Heart would have cleft a&s;under: And in this Pa&s;&s;ion &s;he fell down in a &s;wound upon the wounded Body.</P>
<P><HI>Lucella</HI> was not then a&s;leep, but &s;ollicited by the Love, &s;he bare her Friend, had him continually before the Eyes of her Imagination, and heard the Dam&s;el's Re|grets and Cries: Wherefore not knowing, what to think of it, &s;he look't &s;trait to|wards the Place, where &s;he had &s;een him ly down, but he was no longer there: at which, &s;urpriz'd with an unu&s;ual Iealou&s;y, &s;he ro&s;e up, and ran ha&s;tily towards the &s;tair-ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">e, whence, in her opinion, the Lamentations proceeded, which gave her this Trou|ble.

<P>When <HI>Lucella</HI> had &s;ome time hearkned to her, and perceiv'd, &s;he &s;pake of the death of a Friend, her Blood was in &s;uch a Commotion, that &s;he could no longer bear, what &s;he thought, &s;o that &s;he went up to her, who was endeavouring to pluck out the Sword for to murther her &s;elf: Where &s;eeing the Knight &s;tret'ht out at his length, &s;he ca&s;t forth &s;o loud a Cry, that the Lion, who was a&s;leep, awak't, and fell a roaring in the mo&s;t dreadful manner, that ever was heard, &s;o that <HI>Lucella,</HI> with the Fright, was fly|ing away, when the Bea&s;t caught hold of her Gown, by which, with his Sharp claws, he &s;o violently pluckt her to him, that &s;he was ready to fall down backwards.

<P>During the&s;e Care&s;&s;es, the <HI>Knight of the Burning Sword</HI> could not imagin, whence they proceeded, having never &s;een <HI>Gradafilea:</HI> neverthele&s;s he thought, that perhaps &s;he knew his Father and Mother, and that his name was <HI>Li&s;vart,</HI> as &s;he call'd him.

<P><HI>In good faith,</HI> &s;aid the Knight, <HI>you may put me in mind of what you plea&s;e, but I as little know the Emperor and the Empre&s;s, you &s;peak on, as I do you: Nor can I tell, who are my Father and Mother, which is indeed, the greate&s;t Trouble, and Di&s;plea&s;ure, I could have in this World.</HI></P>

<P>At this very In&s;tant came the King, accompany'd by the Queen, and <HI>Frandamel|la,</HI> wondring to &s;ee the Knight between <HI>Gradafilea</HI> and his Daughter. And as he was opening his mouth, to ask them, how they came there together, he &s;aw the Sword at his Feet, which he knew by its &s;hining Pommel, and taking it up of a &s;uddain, &s;aid: <HI>By my Head, this is not the fir&s;t time, I have handled thee, and I know, that thou belonged&s;t to the be&s;t Knight in the World.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Ah Sir, and who was he?</HI> &s;aid the Knight.</P>
<P><HI>You &s;hall know,</HI> &s;aid the King, <HI>but not now. We mu&s;t fir&s;t &s;ee the Wonders of this Place.</HI></P>

<P>There appear'd in the Air two Hands, holding a golden Crown, enricht with ma|ny great Rubies, Pearls, and Diamonds, which they plac'd upon the Head of <HI>Lu|cella,</HI> and then di&s;appear'd at the &s;ound of a voice, which cry'd out: <HI>Receive, fair Lady, this Reward, in te&s;timony of having put an End to the &s;trange&s;t Adventure, that ever was, or &s;hall be prepar'd for Lady, or Gentlewoman.</HI></P>
<P>This being &s;aid four tall Statues of Alaba&s;ter, which in the four Corners of the Chamber repre&s;ented four Ladies, holding each of them an Harp, began to play &s;o melodious a Tune, that the King and the re&s;t thought, they heard the Ioys of Pa|radi&s;e: and indeed to con&s;ider the Place well, there &s;eem'd al&s;o to be in it &s;ome Di|vinity. For the Walls were of pure Chry&s;tal, under which appear'd, painted in Gold and Azure, many Hi&s;tories of the glorious Feats of Arms, perform'd by &s;everal Illu&s;trious Per&s;onages, which had been from the Time of <HI>Deucalion</HI> till then. The Cieling and the Floor, being all of Mo&s;aick Work, wrought in Chry&s;olite and Par|phyry, rendred the Place &s;o admirable, that it might be properly &s;aid to have been the Wor&s;t, not of <HI>Vulcan,</HI> or <HI>Neptune,</HI> who built the Walls of <HI>Flium;</HI> but of <HI>Pallas,</HI> who had employ'd in it all her Indu&s;try. In the mid&s;t of this Room was al&s;o a Monument of Iacinth, to which there was on every &s;ide an A&s;cent of five &s;teps of gray Marble, and upon it the Repre&s;entation of a great King, compleatly Arm'd, except his Head, which was cleft in two with a blow of a Sword: This re&s;ted on a Pillow of Cloth of Gold, which a Knight held between his Arms, the King having in one hand a little Key of Emerald, and in the other a Padlock, made of a great Carbuncle, which lockt up the Sepulchre, environ'd with Seven and Thirty Kings of Ma&s;&s;y Gold, behind whom a little higher &s;tood twelve Nymphs of Azure &s;tone, holding Silver Trumpets, as if they were ready &s;o Sound. And that it might be better known, who&s;e Body it was, that lay in this Magnificence, there was at his Feet a Tablet of Agat, on which in the <HI>Caldean</HI> Tongue, was graven the following In&s;cription.</P>
<PB N="94" REF="54">
<P><HI>This is the Repre&s;entation of <HI>Zarzafiel,</HI> Soldan of <HI>Babylon,</HI> who, being at the Siege of <HI>Con&s;tantinople</HI> with King <HI>Armato,</HI> was &s;lain with the blow of a Sword by the hand of King <HI>Amadis,</HI> as is &s;een by his Figure: And the Kings, that are about him, being in number &s;even and thirty, repre&s;ent &s;o many Princes, &s;ubject to them, who all dyed in his Company, fighting like valiant and hardy men, as they were. Now to perpetuate his Memory, his Si&s;ter <HI>Zirfea,</HI> Queen of <HI>Argenes,</HI> has caus'd the A&s;hes of his Body to be put in a Ve&s;&s;el or Gold, here underneath, giving by the Magnifi|cence of his Burial a Te&s;timony of the Affection, &s;he bear him, when living: and yet the more to honour him in his death, has given him in keeping the Key of this unparallell'd Trea&s;ure, which &s;hall be well defended, till &s;uch time as the mo&s;t per|fect accompli&s;ht Knight in the World &s;hall enter in here, accompany'd by the faire&s;t Lady, then living: who by Vertue of the &s;ecret Love, they &s;hall bear one another, &s;hall &s;eize on the Key, and open the Padlock.</HI></P>
<P><HI>In good faith,</HI> &s;aid the King to the <HI>Knight of the burning Sword, this Prophe&s;y is, I think, addre&s;t to you, and none el&s;e.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Ah Sir,</HI> an&s;wer'd he, all a&s;ham'd, <HI>you have power to &s;tile me, as you plea&s;e; but I am indeed of opinion, that my Lady your Daughter, who has begun to break the Enchantments, take the Key, to accompli&s;h the re&s;t.</HI></P>

Now <HI>Gradafilea</HI> was exquifitly fair, which made her a&s;&s;uredly think, that, if the Adventure was to be ended by Beauty, &s;he &s;hould go a great way in it.

<P>Then <HI>Lucella</HI> opened the Padlock, with which the Tomb was clos'd, and took off the covering as ea&s;ily, as if it had been of Cork, or Fir: and immed<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">atly the Ima|ges of Azure-Stone began to Sound their Trumpets &s;o loud, that they were heard all over the Palace, at the Sound whereof, there ro&s;e out of the Tenth, the Emperor of <HI>Trebi&s;ond, Li&s;vart</HI> of <HI>Gre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ce, Perion</HI> of <HI>Gaul,</HI> and the Prince <HI>Olorius</HI> of <HI>Spain,</HI> who had till then been Enchanted, and laid a&s;leep under that Plate, without the know|ledge of any one but the Queen <HI>Zirfea.</HI></P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>THe Hi&s;tory of <HI>Li&s;vart</HI> of <HI>Greece,</HI> recited at large in the &s;ixth Book of <HI>Amadis</HI> of <HI>Gaul,</HI> Records, that at the Siege of <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> where King <HI>Amato</HI> was in per&s;on, him&s;elf with the greate&s;t pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">t of the <HI>Pagan</HI> Princes, has an End put to their Days by the high Chivalry at King <HI>Amadis</HI> of <HI>Gaul,</HI> his Son <HI>E&s;plandian,</HI> and others, who&s;e never dying <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 word"> regi&s;tred in the &s;aid volumes.</P>

Of which <HI>Zirfea,</HI> his only Heir, being advertis'd &s;he incontinently &s;et forwards towards <HI>Babylon,</HI> hoping to gain po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Country, where &s;he found one, that her Bro|ther had left there for Governor, who either thro' Love, or Force, had already receiv'd the Crown, and obedience of the Subjects: And for this cau&s;e he commanded her to be gone, and void the Realm, or el&s;e he would <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ut her to death.</P>

<P>Now it hapned &s;ome time after, that <HI>Gradafilea,</HI> under&s;tanding the lo&s;s of <HI>Li&s;vart,</HI> put her &s;elf in que&s;t of him: And having travers'd many &s;trange Countries, without learning any Fews of him, &s;he come at la&s;t to <HI>Zirfea,</HI> to whom &s;he entirly declar'd the Occa&s;ion of her Travel, very earne&s;tly be&s;eeching her, that &s;he would plea&s;e to deliver her out of his Pain.</P>

<P>And to make the Entrance into the Place yet more &s;trange, and difficult, &s;he built a little lower the Perron, where were the &s;even &s;tatues, holding their writings and other Singularities. Then &s;he found the means, to procure five Knights of excellent

<P>Having thus order'd all the&s;e things, being &s;urpriz'd with the Pangs of Child-birth, &s;he brought forth a Daughter of an exqui&s;ite Beauty, whom &s;he nam'd <HI>Axiana.</HI> This Daughter being arriv'd at the Age to be lov'd, and &s;erv'd, as well for the great Gifts, with which Nature had imbelli&s;ht her, as for the good behaviour and gentle Education, with which &s;he was endow'd, <HI>Zirfea</HI> caus'd her to embark, teaching her the means to recover <HI>Lucencio,</HI> whom &s;he brought with her, for the Rea|&s;on we &s;hall tell you in one of our following Chapters.</P>
<P>At <HI>Axiana's</HI> Return, <HI>Zirfea</HI> left her the Government of the whole I&s;land, to go after an Affair, which imported her, and where &s;he was to make a long Abode, which being afterwards come to the knowledge of the Sage <HI>Alquif,</HI> and <HI>Urganda</HI> the <HI>Un|known,</HI> from whom no earthly thing could be conceal'd, they &s;eeing the <HI>Knight of the Burning Sword,</HI> and <HI>Lucella</HI> in the I&s;le of <HI>Silanchy,</HI> with the perfection of their mu|tual Love, believ'd there could be no better Time to di&s;enchant the Emperor of <HI>Tre|bi&s;ond,</HI> and the others, that were &s;o much Regretted.

<P><HI>LAzarus,</HI> coming forth of the Grave, whence he was rais'd by <HI>JESUS CHRIST,</HI> was not more amaz'd to &s;ee him&s;elf again li<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ing in the World, than was the Emperor of <HI>Trebi&s;ond,</HI> and the three Knights, who had &s;o long been Enchanted with him, in the <HI>Chamber of Trea&s;ure;</HI> and that without one's knowing any thing of the other: &s;o that for &s;ome time they look'd upon each other, without being able to utter the lea&s;t word, till at length the Emperor, lifting up his Hands and Eyes to Heaven, began to &s;ay aloud.</P>
<P><HI>O Soveraign GOD! who by your infinite goodne&s;s have created all things of no|thing, and who at no time forget tho&s;e, that are yours, not having regard to the Merits of their Works; but extending over them your ineffable Bounty and Com|pa&s;&s;ion, and that principally, to the end, We, poor Sinners, may know the great

<P>Then embracing now <HI>Li&s;vart,</HI> anon <HI>Perion,</HI> and now again <HI>Olorius,</HI> he &s;aid to them: <HI>Ah! my dear Friends.

<P>Then he ca&s;t his Eye upon <HI>Lucella,</HI> who&s;e Beauty caus'd in him a Remembrance of the Prince&s;s <HI>Onoloria,</HI> &s;o that his Heart began to beat, when pre&s;ently he knew <HI>Gradafilea:</HI> but not the King or Queen at the fir&s;t &s;ight.

<P>Whil&s;t he was making this Harangue, <HI>Li&s;vart</HI> view'd him, as one, whom Nature would have taught him to know: for the Father was &s;peaking to the Son, and the Son to the Father; and yet both the one and the other was Ignorant of this Provi|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ity of their Blood.

<P>Then he threw down a Glove, he had in his hand, and the <HI>Knight of the Burning Sword</HI> &s;tept forward to take it up.

<P><HI>Let it be, as you plea&s;e, Sir,</HI> an&s;wer'd the <HI>Knight of the Burning Sword.</HI></P>
<P>Then they both, without &s;hewing any Alteration obey'd the Kings Plea&s;ure, not without good hopes, when Conveniency &s;hould &s;erve, to let each other know by expe|rience the Prowe&s;s, that was in them, turning them&s;elves at that time to other Di&s;|cour&s;es, and to behold the Singularities of the Chamber, out of which at la&s;t they went.

<P><HI>In good faith,</HI> &s;aid <HI>Li&s;vart</HI> then to the King, <HI>if I have heretofore done you any &s;ervice, in delivering you from the Conjurations of</HI> Medea, <HI>my Lady your Daugh|ter has &s;o well recompen&s;ed me, that I &s;hall be her Servant as long as I live.</HI></P>
<P>Now &s;o long did they amu&s;e them&s;elves in comtemplating the Particularities of the Place, that the Dawning of the Day began to appear: wherefore they went down into the Chamber, in which the King had &s;lept, where they found &s;ome of the Ca&s;tle, whom the Fright had awaked, when the forementioned Images &s;ounded their Trum|pets: among&s;t which a Servant &s;tepping forward, told the <HI>Knight of the Burning Sword,</HI> that <HI>Gradamart,</HI> he, whom he had fought with at the la&s;t Tower, de&s;ir'd to &s;ee him before he dy'd: <HI>For,</HI> &s;aid the Servant, <HI>he is very weak, by rea&s;on of the blood; he lo&s;t la&s;t night, and has &s;o great an e&s;teem for you, that he will think his &s;oul much at ea&s;e, if you do him the favour to vi&s;it him.</HI></P>

<P><HI>Gradafilea,</HI> hearing her Brother &s;till &s;peak with &s;o much &s;trength, took heart again, and having recover'd her Speech, made him this An&s;wer: <HI>My deare&s;t Brother, your Life and Death are at their Di&s;po&s;al: but if they have ordain'd the Removal of you out of this World, I de&s;ire you, before I &s;ee your Eyes clos'd, to put an end to my days with your Hands, that our Spi|rits may accompany each other before them, and never be &s;eparated, whether in Hell, or in the</HI> Ely&s;ian <HI>Fields, as it &s;hall plea&s;e them to ordain.</HI></P>

<P>In the mean time the <HI>Knight of the burning Sword</HI> drew near to <HI>Gra|damart,</HI> who, to excu&s;e his having &s;ent for him, &s;aid to him: <HI>Sir Knight, the Cau&s;e, which emboldned me to entreat a Vi&s;it from you before my Death, is the E&s;teem, I have of you above any other, I know: as well for the Prowe&s;s that is in you, as for the Courte&s;y, you us'd ye&s;terday towards me, giving me my life, when you might have taken it away upon the Place.

<P>The <HI>Knight of the Burning Sword,</HI> con&s;idering the Honour, which <HI>Grada|mart</HI> did him, would in Complacency grant him, what he with &s;o great In&s;tance de&s;ir'd, which was his Friend&s;hip, in doing of which he made u&s;e of the like gracious Speeches and Expre&s;&s;ions, as the other had done, &s;aying to him: <HI>By my Head, Sir</HI> Gradamart, <HI>if the Glory of Victorious Combats ought to be pre|&s;ented to him, who&s;e ju&s;t Due it is, I ought in rea&s;on to offer you my Sword; for you have gain'd &s;o much upon me, that I am henceforth wholly yours, very well knowing, that Vertue alone is indeed more powerful, than all the forces of men.</HI></P>

He commanded them immediatly to be &s;ercht, being to the number of Fifty, all lodg'd in a deep Dungeon, chain'd with grea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter"> T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="4 letters">s, and having Ma|nacles on their Hands, and Fetters on their Feet, &s;o that they endur'd a Life, more mi&s;erable than a thou&s;and Deaths together. When therefore the Goaler made them a&s;cend by a Ladder, he let down to them, they thinking, that they were going to receive their la&s;t Puni&s;hment, fervently de&s;ir'd him to tell them, in what manner they were to end their dayes: <HI>Since it cannot</HI> (&s;aid they) <HI>be &s;o cruel, as not to be more agreeable to us, than this long and hard Pri&s;on.</HI></P>
<P><HI>My Friends,</HI> an&s;wer'd the Gaofer, <HI>you will be better us'd than you expect, follow me.</HI></P>
<P>He then guided them to <HI>Gradamarts</HI> Chamber, into which &s;ix of them entred fir&s;t, dragging along their great Iron Chains. Being come in, they put their Knees to the Ground, and pro&s;trated them&s;elves, &s;aluting the Company, by whom they were pre&s;ently known, one of them being <HI>Adariel</HI> Prince of <HI>Naples,</HI> the re&s;t, the two Brothers <HI>Suycias</HI> and <HI>Abies</HI> of <HI>Ireland,</HI> Sons to King <HI>Cildadan, Vaillades,</HI> Son to <HI>Don Bruneo</HI> the Count of <HI>Ala&s;tra,</HI> and <HI>Alarco,</HI> who being in que&s;t of the Emperor, and the other Knights, after they had pa&s;s'd through many Adventures, too tedious to tell you, fell into the Hands of <HI>Zirfea,</HI> who impri&s;on'd them with the re&s;t, &s;he had before.</P>
<P>The Emperor and the re&s;t them embrac'd them, rejoycing, and wondring both at their bad and good Fortune. Neither was their any Pri&s;oner, who did not recount, how all had befaln him, the Mi&s;ery, and great Hunger, they had &s;o long endur'd: In fine, they prais'd GOD for their Deliverance, concluding together, that they, who fear, &s;erve, and honor him, &s;hall never be forgotten by him.</P>

<P>NEws then being brought, that the Infanta <HI>Axiana</HI> drew near her Ca&s;tle, the Emperor with the other Knights entred into Con&s;ultation, what was be&s;t to be done. Some were of Opinion, to run upon her, and &s;urprize her with her Company. But <HI>Perion</HI> of <HI>Gaul,</HI> one of the mo&s;t courteous and gentle Princes, then living, advis'd the contrary, &s;aying, it would be better to &s;end one of them, who might acquaint her, with what was befaln the Guards of her Fortre&s;s; but that ne|verthele&s;s, if &s;he pleas'd to lodge there, &s;he &s;hould be receiv'd with all the Honor and Reverence, her Greatne&s;s and Beauty merited.</P>
<P><HI>For,</HI> &s;aid he <HI>I &s;hall always commend the treating an Enemy with re&s;pect, principal|ly when he is in greate&s;t Adver&s;ity, leting every one under&s;tand, that honour is in&s;epa|rable from a Noble and generous Heart, &s;hewing it &s;elf no le&s;s in the depth of Mis|fortune and Infelicity, than in the height of Pro&s;perity and Happine&s;s: So that, tho' Fortune may often enough bring to nothing earthly Goods, which are &s;ubject
<PB N="105" REF="59"> to her Incon&s;tancy; yet has &s;he no Power over the Merit and Vertues of the Per|&s;on, which re&s;ide in the Soul.</HI></P>
<P>To this Re&s;olution every one agreed, and as they were con&s;idering, who was fitte&s;t to carry the Me&s;&s;age to <HI>Axiana,</HI> the King of <HI>Sicily</HI> remon&s;trated to them, that none could be more proper, than <HI>Frandamella: For,</HI> &s;aid he, Axiana <HI>receiving this di&s;pea&s;ing News by a Woman, the Fury, which may &s;urprize her, cannot bring a long with it &s;uch &s;peedy Vengeance, as it might again&s;t one of us; but will be mi|tigated, &s;eeing with whom it &s;hall have to do: So that all will go the better.</HI></P>
<P>For this rea&s;on was the Dam&s;el &s;ent, who, being amply in&s;tructed for her Amba&s;&s;y, and having an E&s;quire to guide her, &s;et forth on her way towards the Infanta, that was come to dine in an Hou&s;e of Plea&s;ure &s;he had, &s;ituated by the Sea-&s;ide. But <HI>Frandamella</HI> was &s;oon perceiv'd to turn back in great ha&s;t, and a&s;cend the Ca&s;tle &s;tairs, till &s;he came into the Chamber, where all the Knights were &s;till di&s;cour&s;ing together, whom &s;he thus be&s;pake: <HI>My Lords, if you plea&s;e to &s;ee the Combat of one Knight again&s;t &s;ix, come to the fir&s;t Tower, where I have left them, and you &s;hall there have that Diver&s;ion.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Li&s;vart Perion,</HI> and <HI>Olorious,</HI> hearing the News, ran thither armed, as they were; as did al&s;o the <HI>Knight of the Burning Sword;</HI> and being arriv'd, where <HI>Fran|damella</HI> had directed them, found the &s;ix fiercely a&s;&s;aulting him, that was alone, who was a comely and couragious Knight, mounted on a &s;turdy &s;teed, and &s;o valiantly behav'd him&s;elf, that he had already wounded the other in &s;everal places. Now he was arm'd in black Armor, without any Devi&s;e, &s;ave that on his Shield there was in a Field <HI>Or</HI> a Ca&s;tle <HI>Gules,</HI> and he &s;o be&s;tirr'd him&s;elf, that they, who beheld him, could not &s;ay otherwi&s;e of him, but that he was a gallant man: for he had in an in|&s;tant &s;lain out-right two of the &s;toute&s;t; yet the four that were left, displeas'd at this lo&s;s, &s;par'd him &s;o little, that it was to be wondred, how he was able to re&s;i&s;t them. He neverthele&s;s &s;hew'd them &s;uch play, &s;triking on the right hand, and the left, &s;o thick and home, that he &s;oon di&s;patch't likewi&s;e the third. Wherefore their Companions, growing more Outragious, fell in upon him, and by &s;trength of Arm threw him (whether he would or no) out of his Saddle upon the Gra&s;s: but he car|ried two of them along with him, holding them &s;o clo&s;ely embrac't, that they could no way offend him: which greatly amaz'd the Beholders. The la&s;t &s;eeing this, ha|&s;tily &s;et foot to ground, thinking to relieve his Companions, and murther the other, which he had que&s;tionle&s;s done, had he not been hindred by tho&s;e, that were looking on, who call'd out to him to Retire, or they would certainly fall upon him.</P>
<P>The Gallant, much a&s;toni&s;ht at this Menace, and doubting wor&s;e, &s;uddainly took Hor&s;e again, returning with full &s;peed the way he came. In the mean time, tho&s;e that were thus linkt together, &s;o long &s;trove and &s;truggled, &s;ometimes upper, &s;ome|times under, that they were forc'd for want of Breath to let go their Hold, and get up again, yet not cea&s;ing their Fight, which they began again with their Swords, as if they had done nothing all the day.

<HEAD>CHAP. XXVIII.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>How the Knight, which fled, return'd to his Companions, bringing with him <HI>Lu|cencio,</HI> who fought again&s;t the <HI>Knight of the Burning Sword.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THe two Knights being thus handled, and as it were ready to lay down their Arms, he, that had fled, was &s;een to return, accomyany'd by another, moun|ted on a great black Hor&s;e, and clad in Green, Armor, powdred all over with Quivers and Arrows of Gold, and bearing in his Shield a Ladies hand, holding a Bow, with an Arrow ready fixt. He was no &s;ooner come thither, but he Alighted, and embra|cing his Shield, drew his Sword out of the Scabbard, which was all over cover'd with Pearls, Rubies, and Diamonds: But the <HI>Knight of the burning Sword</HI> doub|ting, he would fall upon him in the black Armor, (whom he judg'd within him&s;elf to be one of the brave&s;t men in the World) covering him&s;elf with his Shield, and ha|ving his Sword in his hand &s;tept forth, and &s;aid to the new Commer: <HI>'Tis with me Knight, 'tis with me, you have to do; and not with him, who is already tir'd by having &s;o gallantly performed his Duty. Nor would it be rea&s;onable, that you, who are fre&s;h, and unlabour'd, &s;hould a&s;&s;ail him &s;o much to your Advantage.</HI></P>
<P><HI>How?</HI> an&s;wer'd he, <HI>Will you then hinder me from revenging my People, whom he had &s;lain? Since you are &s;o void of &s;ence, as thus to engage your &s;elf in anothers Quarrel, &s;tay, and you &s;hall have the Cha&s;ti&s;ement you de&s;erve.</HI></P>
<P>This being &s;aid, they began to charge each other with &s;o much Fiercene&s;s, and Nimblene&s;s, that the Spectators &s;aid, they had never beheld a better Combat: of which <HI>Perion, Li&s;vart,</HI> and <HI>Olorius,</HI> were not a little glad, that they might know, by the Effect, whether he <HI>of the burning Sword</HI> was &s;o good a Knight, as he was af|firm'd to be.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t the&s;e things were doing, he in the black Armor had &s;lain one of the two, with whom he was fighting, and was now ready to di&s;patch the la&s;t, who by ca&s;ting him&s;elf at his Feet, and begging his Pardon, pre&s;erv'd his Life. Yet the other, who fled to fetch Succour, minded him not, but &s;et him&s;elf again&s;t the <HI>Knight of the burning Sword,</HI> thinking, that, if he were defeated, the other in the black Arms would be more ea&s;ily ma&s;ter'd. But as he was couching his Lance, to run again&s;t him, <HI>Olorius,</HI> catching hold of the Straps of his Shield, pull'd him with &s;o much violence, that he brought him to the Ground, where he &s;o treated him with the Pom|mel of his Sword, that, the Laces of his Helmet breaking, his Head was di&s;arm'd. He then cry'd out for Mercy: but <HI>Olorius</HI> an&s;wer'd him: <HI>Ra&s;cal, you &s;hall dye: for the World cannot but be the wor&s;e for your abiding in't:</HI> and with that lifting up
<PB N="107" REF="60"> his Fi&s;t, he gave him &s;uch a blow on the Ear, with his Gantlet, as put an End to his Life.</P>
<P>Already had the two others fought &s;o long, that every one wondred at it, and yet neither of them appear'd in the lea&s;t weary'd, but &s;till continu'd better and better: wherefore <HI>Li&s;vart</HI> de&s;ir'd <HI>Frandamella</HI> to go fetch the Emperor, and tho&s;e, that &s;tay'd with him, a&s;&s;uring them, they &s;hould &s;ee, what would give them Plea&s;ure. The Dam&s;el ran to 'em, and told 'em, all &s;he had &s;een of the Combatants: wherefore they made ha&s;t thither, where they found the two Knights &s;till as Active, as if they had but ju&s;t begun.</P>
<P>The &s;ame Moment arriv'd there al&s;o <HI>Axiana,</HI> who had &s;tay'd behind, having a great Attendance of Ladies, Gentlewomen, E&s;quires, and others. She was excee|ding fair, and of an excellent Meen, being mounted on a white Palfrey, adorn'd with Hou&s;ings of flower'd Cloth of Gold, hanging down on every &s;ide. But when &s;he &s;aw the cruel Combat between the two Knights, and &s;o great a Troop, among&s;t whom &s;he di&s;cern'd tho&s;e at Liberty, whom &s;he was wont to keep Pri&s;oners, never was Woman more a&s;toni&s;ht: for &s;he had not yet under&s;tood any thing of her lo&s;s, which could not (had &s;he known it) have &s;o much troubled her, as did the Danger, in which &s;he perceiv'd him in the Green Armor, whom &s;he lov'd better than her &s;elf, to be: at which being wholly di&s;turb'd, and almo&s;t be&s;ide her &s;elf, &s;he was ready to &s;ink down in a &s;wound. But &s;hame hindring it, &s;he alighted off her Hor&s;e, becau&s;e her Knight was fighting on foot.</P>
<P>Then <HI>Li&s;vart</HI> approacht, and making her a very low Reverence, askt her, whe|ther &s;he pleas'd to have a Chair brought her out of the Ca&s;tle, that &s;he might place her &s;elf more at her ea&s;e.</P>
<P>She, &s;eeing him &s;o fair, humble, and well behav'd, thus an&s;wer'd him: <HI>Knight, if my Ea&s;e would be any greater for being &s;at, I would not refu&s;e this offer; but it is &s;o di&s;turb'd by &s;eeing the Danger of the&s;e two Combatants, that it would be impo&s;&s;ible to be more: I neverthele&s;s heartily thank you, and de&s;ire you to tell me, who you are.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Madam,</HI> an&s;wer'd <HI>Li&s;vart, who ever I am, you have in me, a Souldier, to &s;erve and honor you, as I u&s;e to do all &s;uch fair Ladies, as you are.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Ah!</HI> &s;aid the Infanta, <HI>The Day will come, when I &s;hall (perhaps) have a better Opportunity to thank you for this Civility.</HI></P>
<P>They had continu'd their di&s;cour&s;e longer, had not the Peril, &s;he &s;aw her Friend in, imploy'd her Thoughts on &s;omewhat el&s;e. Neverthele&s;s, neither of the two Knights could gain any thing over the other; but they &s;o bravely maintain'd them|&s;elves, that for the Space of two long hours it was not known, to whom the greater Glory was to be attributed, they growing both &s;o weary, that they were forc't to take breath, and re&s;t them&s;elves a little. I may well &s;ay <HI>a little:</HI> For the Green Knight, &s;eeing the fair <HI>Axiana</HI> full of Trouble, and her Countenance pale, and without colour, thro' the great Perplexity, &s;he was in, was &s;o mov'd, that parrying, what was left of his Shield, he recharg'd his Enemy with marvellous Fiercene&s;s. Nor
<PB N="108" REF="61"> was the other much behind him, &s;o revenging him&s;elf, that the Gra&s;s, on which they &s;tood, grew red again, and the Spectators certainly thought, that they would both there leave their Lives, their Animo&s;ity &s;till increa&s;ing; &s;o that they &s;eiz'd each other by the Arms, &s;triving to gain that by &s;trength of Body, which they could not obtain by their Swords. Neverthele&s;s it was impo&s;&s;ible for either of them to get any Advantage over the other; but after much and long &s;trugling, with all imagina|ble Indu&s;try, they return'd to their Swords, with which they laid &s;o de&s;perately about them, that they had &s;carce any Armor left, with which they might cover, or defend them&s;elves: So that their bare Fle&s;h was &s;een, the Blood &s;treaming down on all &s;ides, and their Armor ready to drop off by pieces, if they fought any longer.</P>
<P>Then <HI>Axiana,</HI> no farther able to hear her Friends Danger, began to wring her hands, and cro&s;s her Arms, like a Woman, pierc't with &s;orrow. Which the green Knight &s;eeing, took &s;uch Courage, that (thinking to cleave his Enemies Head) he lift up his Sword with both hands, to which the other oppos'd his Shield; and yet the Blow was &s;uch, that parting in two, what it met, the Point fell with &s;uch Force on his Helmet, that his Eyes &s;parkled, and he &s;tagger'd, ready to fall to the ground. Neverthele&s;s he &s;oon recover'd, and to revenge him&s;elf, flew with &s;uch Fury at him, who had &s;o much out-rag'd him, that &s;eizing the &s;traps of his Shield, he pull'd it &s;o violently to him, that he got po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it, and threw it behind him in great &s;pight. At which the Green Knight being amaz'd, as knowing the want he &s;hould have of it, &s;hew'd him&s;elf thence-forward more fearful, then he had till that time done: For he knew not, with what to cover him&s;elf, nor how any longer to re&s;i&s;t the other, who pre&s;s'd him &s;o clo&s;e, that every one evidently di&s;cern'd his Fortune to be adver&s;e, and that the Victory would certainly be the <HI>Knight</HI>'s <HI>of the burning Sword.</HI></P>
<P><Q REND="margQuotes">Ah! ha! poor <HI>Axiana!</HI> where it not better, you would find &s;ome means to &s;epe|rate them? Alas! why do you delay? You &s;ee your Friend at the la&s;t point of Dan|ger, and yet you remedy it not.</Q> And to &s;ay true, &s;he was &s;o troubled, and full of Bitterne&s;s, that &s;he could not utter &s;o much as one word.</P>
<P>At which <HI>Li&s;vart</HI> mov'd with Pity, could not forbear &s;aying to her: <HI>I wonder, Madam, why you con&s;ent thus to the Death of two &s;uch Knights in your Pre&s;ence: Indeed you will do very ill, if you permit them to &s;ight any longer, For God's &s;ake then, &s;ince you can remedy it, &s;eparate them, and de&s;ire them at your reque&s;t to be|come Friends: And if they will not con&s;ent for love, give order, that you be obey'd by force; or el&s;e the Lo&s;s of them will be an incomparable wound to all Knight|hood, they being &s;uch valiant men, as every one may &s;ee.</HI></P>
<P>Alas he exactly hit on the Evil, that tormented her, nor could he at that time have made her any Di&s;cour&s;e, more agreeable to her. And therefore following <HI>Li&s;varts</HI> Coun&s;el, &s;he took Heart, and went &s;traight to the Combarants, who (in re&s;pect to her) retir'd at her approach.</P>
<P>Then having her Face cover'd with Tears, &s;he began to &s;ay to them: <HI>I de&s;ire you, Knights, that you will for my &s;ake de&s;i&s;t, and make Peace together: Which, I be|lieve you will not refu&s;e me, &s;ince I beg it of you with &s;uch Affection. And be&s;ides,
<PB N="109" REF="61"> where Prowe&s;s and Valour is &s;o apparent, Courte&s;y cannot be far away, which you will favourably exerci&s;e on me, who am &s;uch, as My Pre&s;ence may te&s;tify.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Knight of the Burning Sword,</HI> hearing her &s;peake &s;o &s;weetly, was willing to let every one know, that he was no le&s;s affable, than valiant: wherefore he thus an&s;wer'd her: <HI>Madam I will obey you, if he, with whom I have to do, will con|&s;ent to it.</HI></P>
<P><HI>I undertake,</HI> &s;aid <HI>Axiana, he &s;hall do it: for he his mine, and will no way contra|dict, what I &s;hall command him.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Since it is &s;o, Madam,</HI> an&s;wer'd the <HI>Knight of the burning Sword, I be&s;eech you to tell me his Name, that I may henceforth know him, who has made me &s;uffer more than any other, I ever fought with.</HI></P>
<P><HI>That I will do for your &s;ake,</HI> &s;aid &s;he, <HI>and you &s;hall &s;ee him pre&s;ently bare-fac'd, to the end you may the better know him.</HI></P>
<P>Then taking off his Helmet, &s;he &s;aid: <HI>Now &s;ee, if you &s;hall know him again, and then I will tell you his Name.</HI></P>
<P><HI>In good faith, Madam,</HI> an&s;wer'd he, <HI>I &s;hould never have thought to find &s;o great Va|lour in &s;o fair and young a Gentleman.</HI> And to &s;ay the Truth, he was one of the mo&s;t excellent Per&s;onages, that could be &s;een.</P>
<P>Then <HI>Axiana,</HI> continuing her Di&s;cour&s;e, &s;aid: <HI>His Name is</HI> Lucencio; <HI>but we mu&s;t de&s;ire to be excus'd from giving you account of his Parentage: &s;ince neither he nor I know any thing of it.</HI></P>
<P><HI>As I live, Madam,</HI> an&s;wer'd the <HI>Knight, of the Burning Sword, it would be then very un&s;eemly for us two, between whom there is &s;o great a Conformity, to fight one again&s;t the other: for I know my Father and Mother as little, as he does his, and this makes me think, that perhaps we may be Kin&s;men.</HI></P>
<P>This, though &s;poken at random, was yet Truer, than he was aware: for they were both Co&s;ens, he being Son to <HI>Li&s;vart</HI> of <HI>Greece,</HI> and <HI>Lucencio</HI> to <HI>Per&s;on</HI> of <HI>Gaul,</HI> the Fathers and the Children, being all four A&s;&s;embled to|gether, the neither then, nor of a long time after, knowing one another. And to omit nothing that belongs to our Hi&s;tory, you &s;hall know, how <HI>Axiana</HI> brought <HI>Lucencio</HI> into this I&s;le of <HI>Argenes.</HI></P>
<P>You well remember, I believe the Dutche&s;s of <HI>Savoy</HI>'s Arrival at <HI>Con&s;tantino|ple,</HI> caus'd by a Tempe&s;t, which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ave her Ship on the Coa&s;t of <HI>Thrace,</HI> as &s;he was conducting the fair Gentleman into Great <HI>Britain,</HI> there to receive the Order of Knighthood, and in what manner <HI>Lucencio</HI> undertook to go and fight the Knight, who had took the Helmet from the Gentlewoman, as you were told at large in the beginning of this Book. Now <HI>Axiana</HI> was &s;he, by whom he recovered what he &s;ought for, and to whom he promis'd al&s;o a Gift, for the Accompli&s;hment of which, he entred into her Ve&s;&s;el, &s;ailing with her, till they came into the I&s;le of <HI>Argenes,</HI> where going a&s;hore, <HI>Lucencio</HI> was, by <HI>Axiana,</HI> requir'd to keep the Seventh Tower of the Ca&s;tle, in which was the Chamber of Trea&s;ure: and this &s;he did by the Coun|&s;el of her Mother <HI>Zirfea,</HI> who gave her the Direction and Means of finding him, yet
<PB N="110" REF="62"> without telling her any thing of his Lineage. She per&s;waded her indeed, that his Company would be very agreeable to her. And in this &s;he deceiv'd her not: for from their fir&s;t Enterview they &s;o mutually loved each other, that <HI>Axiana</HI> granted him, what &s;he mo&s;t e&s;teem'd, provided he merited it by his Valour, of which he &s;hould make proof, by keeping the Tower two whole Years. And he was now at the end of them, when Fortune brought into the I&s;land the <HI>Knight of the Burning Sword,</HI> with whom he fought: for returning from Hunting, to which <HI>Axiana,</HI> to keep him from Melancholly, often took him, &s;ix of his Knights met him in the black Arms, and fell upon him, hoping to take him, and impri&s;on him, according to the Cu&s;tom. Now the Infanta &s;taid behind with <HI>Lucencio;</HI> but he, that fled from his Companions at their need, ha&s;tned them; and they were both afterwards treated, as you have heard. Thus have we re&s;um'd the Thred of our Hi&s;tory, by returning to him, whom we had left at the beginning; but the Matter being now di&s;pos'd to bring him again upon the &s;tage, you &s;ee him return with his green Armor and Shield, on which was painted the Bow, the Quiver, and the Arrow, to te&s;tify the Pa&s;&s;ion of his afflicted Heart, loving (as he did) the Queen of <HI>Argenes</HI> fair Daughter, to whom the Emperor, to let her under&s;tand the Plea&s;ure, he receiv'd by the Agreement of the two Knights, &s;aid very re&s;pectfully: <HI>Indeed Madam, you this day oblige many worthy per&s;ons, by ending the Quarrel between two &s;uch Knights, as yours, and him</HI> of the burning Sword: <HI>And we mu&s;t confe&s;s, that the great Beauty, with which Nature has endow'd you, has more prevail'd over them, than all we toge|ther &s;hould have done.</HI></P>
<P>And becau&s;e &s;he had never &s;een the Emperor, <HI>Li&s;vart</HI> acquainted her, who he was. Now &s;he had hitherto thought him lo&s;t, and could not imagin, in what manner ei|ther he, or any of the re&s;t, came into <HI>Argenes:</HI> Neverthele&s;s converting at this time her wonder to a more &s;uitable Di&s;cour&s;e, &s;he with very great Re&s;pect &s;aid to him: <HI>Sir, I be&s;eech you to pardon me for not having at fir&s;t made you the Reception you merit, for, had I known you, I would certainly have paid you the Re&s;pect, due to your Quality, not con&s;idering the ill will, I naturally ought to bear you, who partly caus'd the death of my neare&s;t Relations. But &s;ince they cannot be recall'd to life, reflecting, that rather through their own Unhappine&s;s, than otherwi&s;e, the Fortune of VVar treated them in this manner, <HI>I</HI> will attribute nothing to you, intreating you (at lea&s;t) to tell me, how the Guards of this place have &s;o ea&s;ily &s;uf|fer'd your Abode here, and who has oblig'd them to &s;et at liberty tho&s;e, whom I held in my Pri&s;ons.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Madam,</HI> an&s;wer'd he, <HI>your Guards are defeated, and &s;lain, in revenge of the per|nicious Cu&s;tom, too long maintained by them under you, the&s;e three Knights and my &s;elf having been mi&s;erably inchanted, and laid to &s;leep in the place, where the Queen your Mother has detain'd us, and al&s;o all the&s;e poor captive Strangers in Dungeons in very great mi&s;ery.</HI></P>
<P>This News could not but be very di&s;plea&s;ing to her, tho' &s;he then &s;hew'd her &s;elf rather con&s;tant, than vanqui&s;ht with pa&s;&s;ion, &s;aying to the Emperor: <HI>How? Are
<PB N="111" REF="62"> my people then defeated? and is my place lo&s;t? VVell! Fortune however &s;hall never have the power to make</HI> Axiana <HI>lo&s;e the Magnanimity of Courage, which is natural to her, as being de&s;cended of &s;o noble a Race: for knowing her incon&s;tan|cy, and the Moveablene&s;s of her wheel, I know well, &s;he cannot continue, or &s;tand firm: and therefore I de&s;ire you to give me leave, at lea&s;t, to retire with this Knight of mine; my VVomen and Servants &s;hall, if you plea&s;e, &s;tay in this Ca&s;tle, which the Gods will at &s;ome other time put again into my hands: and in the mean while, I &s;hall learn in time to dige&s;t, what my heart thinks, and my Tongue con|ceals</HI></P>
<P>The Emperor, hearing her &s;peak &s;o di&s;creetly, and without a&s;toni&s;hment, greatly commended her in him&s;elf, and thus an&s;wer'd her: <HI>Madam, if you plea&s;e to keep us company, Night now approaching, we will do you all the Honour we can; but if you like better to take &s;ome other way, you may freely do it, and tho&s;e al&s;o, that will follow you.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Sir,</HI> reply'd &s;he, <HI>you &s;hew your &s;elf &s;o gracious to me, that I mu&s;t give you thanks for &s;o great Civility: Neverthele&s;s the gods forbid, I &s;hould grant my Enemy the Favour, which is in my power to deny him: I will go then (&s;ince you permit it) with a Re&s;olution never to re-enter this Ca&s;tle, till it be mine again, as it was.</HI></P>
<P>Then &s;he caus'd her Palfrey to be brought, on which the green Knight plac'd her, being very glad to &s;ee the Emperor of <HI>Trebi&s;ond,</HI> of whom he was de&s;cended. Ne|verthele&s;s fearing to di&s;plea&s;e <HI>Axiana,</HI> he wi&s;ely conceal'd his Thoughts, and fol|lowed the Infanta, who with her Company returned the way &s;he came. And arri|ving at her Hou&s;e of plea&s;ure, where &s;he had Dined, &s;he incontinently cau&s;ed her Knight to be di&s;armed, for he was wounded in &s;everal places; but the Old Man, that carry'd the Falcon; when he found the King and the Ladies near the fir&s;t Co|lumns, as you were told before, promis'd her, that he would &s;oon put him out of dan|ger, &s;o expert he was in &s;uch things.</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P>How the Knight in the black Arms was known by the Emperor, and the re&s;t: with the Di&s;cour&s;es, they had together.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>SCarce was <HI>Axiana</HI> gone a Bow &s;hoot, when the Knight in the black Armor, came to pay his Duty to the Emperor, and putting his Knee to the ground, would have ki&s;s'd his Hands: to which the Emperor would not any way con&s;ent; but lifting him up, &s;aid: <HI>Knight, pray, let me know your Name, that I may give you a fitting Reception and Entertainment.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Sir,</HI> an&s;wered he, <HI>I will obey your Maje&s;ty, in whatever you plea&s;e to command
<PB N="112" REF="63"> me: but for God's &s;ake tell me, whether</HI> Perion <HI>of</HI> Gaul, <HI>and</HI> Li&s;vart <HI>of</HI> Greece, <HI>who were taken with you, be yet living?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Living are they indeed, and there they are both,</HI> &s;aid the Emperor, &s;hewing them to him, who immediately went to &s;alute them, and embracing them both, cry'd out aloud: <HI>Now have I before me, what I have mo&s;t de&s;ir'd to &s;ee! Ah! my Lords, how great a plea&s;ure doth your pre&s;ence give me.</HI></P>
<P><HI>If we knew, who you are,</HI> &s;aid <HI>Perion, we &s;hould perhaps be partakers of your Joy.</HI></P>
<P><HI>My Lords,</HI> an&s;wer'd he, <HI>my Name is</HI> Balan, <HI>Son of</HI> Galeotes, <HI>who&s;e Father, and my Grand-Father was</HI> Bravor, <HI>Lord of the I&s;land of the</HI> Vermillian Tower. <HI>My Mother is</HI> Mada&s;ima, <HI>Daughter to</HI> Don Galvanes, <HI>Lord of the I&s;land of</HI> Mongaza, <HI>and I prote&s;t unto you, on my Faith, that I have no le&s;s de&s;ire to employ my &s;elf in your &s;ervice, than my Predece&s;&s;ors had, whom you know, hoping that the Amity you bare them, will not be le&s;s to me, who am their I&s;&s;ue.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Sir</HI> Balan, &s;aid <HI>Li&s;vart, you are very welcome: But tell us, what Adventure has brought you hither; and wherefore tho&s;e, whom you have vanqui&s;ht, a&s;&s;ail'd you thus?</HI></P>
<P>We &s;hall know that an&s;wer'd the Emperor, all in good time, but now let us re|tire. <HI>For the Night comes on, and I believe, both he, and the</HI> Knight of the burn|ing Sword, <HI>have more need of Re&s;t, than of longer Di&s;cour&s;e.</HI></P>
<P>This &s;aid, they went back to the Ca&s;tle, whither being come, <HI>the Knight of the Burning Sword</HI> de&s;ir'd, that he might have a Bed made ready in the &s;ame Chamber with <HI>Gradamart.</HI> Then were his Wounds &s;earcht, and found to he more deep and dangerous than tho&s;e of <HI>Balan,</HI> who, being with-drawn, could not take any re&s;t, not &s;o much for the Blows he had receiv'd, as for a &s;orrow, which continually &s;eiz'd his Heart, &s;o that he did nothing but lament and &s;l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="2 letters">h, with the cau&s;e of which, his Me|lancholly, I am going to acquaint you.</P>
<P>It is recorded in the Hi&s;tory of <HI>Amadis de Gaul,</HI> how <HI>Amadis</HI> marryed <HI>Bravor,</HI> Son to the Giant <HI>Balan,</HI> with the Daughter of <HI>Darioletta,</HI> and that of him de&s;cen|ded <HI>Galeotes,</HI> of whom mention is made in the &s;ixth Volume of that Hi&s;tory. This <HI>Galeotes</HI> being at <HI>London,</HI> had News of his Fathers Death, but before his Depar|ture, the King caus'd him to Marry <HI>Mada&s;ima,</HI> Daughter to <HI>Galvanes,</HI> whom he took along with him to the I&s;land of the <HI>Vermillion Tower,</HI> where they were re|ceiv'd by his Subjects, who did him Homage, as their True and Natural Lord. The Year following <HI>Mada&s;ima</HI> was brought to bed of a Son, whom from his great Grand|father they nam'd <HI>Balan,</HI> and this is he of whom we now &s;peak. He then being come to the Age of Eighteen Years, as <HI>Galeotes</HI> and his Wife were one day toge|ther with their Son, recreating them&s;elves on the Sea-&s;hore, not any way di&s;tru&s;ting Fortune, the Giant <HI>Gandalfe,</HI> Lord of the <HI>Sagittary I&s;land,</HI> Sailing along that Coa&s;t, Arm'd and Equipp'd like a Pyrate, as he was, went a&s;hore to refre&s;h him|&s;elf, where he &s;urpriz'd <HI>Galeotes</HI> and his Company, whom he carry'd away Pri&s;o|ners: for they had neither Arms, nor time to get any; nor yet to retire into their
<PB N="113" REF="63"> Ca&s;tle, of which the Giant made him&s;elf Ma&s;ter by &s;urprize. Then <HI>Balan,</HI> young, and full of Courage, &s;eeing this Misfortune befallen, and his Father and Mother Pri&s;oners, was ready to dye for &s;pight: and tho' he had not yet receiv'd the Order of Knighthood, he could not forbear &s;aying to <HI>Gandalfe.</HI></P>
<P><HI>As GOD &s;hall &s;ave me, Sir Knight, if the Right, you have u&s;urpt in this Countrey, were to be determin'd by Combat between you and me, I &s;hould not que&s;tion, but to make you know, that you have Cowardly and Unju&s;tly entred into it; and would &s;end your head to King</HI> Amadis, <HI>who&s;e Va&s;&s;als we are, and whom, by treating us in this manner, you Affront.</HI></P>
<P>The King of the <HI>Sagittary I&s;land,</HI> was not a little di&s;pleas'd at this his Speech, which put him in &s;uch a Rage, that he commanded <HI>Galeotes</HI> and <HI>Mada&s;ima</HI> to be taken and whipt with the Hor&s;es Reins in their Sons Pre&s;ence, to whom he &s;aid: <HI>Hearken,</HI> Balan, <HI>I leave thee at Liberty to go where thou li&s;t, and receive Knight|hood, &s;wearing to thee by the great God</HI> Iupiter, <HI>that I will &s;tay for thee, and fight with thee, as &s;oon as thou &s;halt Return. And that thou maye&s;t have more Rea&s;on to make ha&s;t, there &s;hall not, by my Fathers &s;oul, pa&s;s a day, but the&s;e, whom thou ha&s;t &s;een &s;o well &s;courged, &s;hall be yet more &s;everely handled in de&s;pight of thee, and thy King</HI> Amadis, <HI>that he and all others may know that I can cha&s;ti&s;e &s;uch fools, as believe in any Gods but mine.</HI></P>
<P>Then he commanded a Bark to be provided, into which <HI>Balan</HI> entred, very glad of the means, he had to pro&s;ecute his Revenge; but no le&s;s di&s;contented for the Torment, in which he left <HI>Galeotes</HI> and <HI>Mada&s;ima.</HI> To remedy which, he Sailed &s;traight into great <HI>Britain,</HI> and landed at the Port next to the Kay, where King <HI>Amadis</HI> was, daily beholding the great Actions, done by the Dutche&s;s of <HI>Savoys</HI> Knight. <HI>Balan</HI> acquainted the King with all, that had befallen <HI>Galeotes,</HI> who was much troubled at it, but, to comfort him, &s;aid, that by the Grace of GOD he would provide to remedy it. Thus eight Days pa&s;s'd, during which the Dutche&s;&s;es Knight behaved him&s;elf &s;o valiantly, that <HI>Balan</HI> be&s;ought the King, he might receive from him the Order of Knighthood. This &s;o pleas'd <HI>Amadis,</HI> that be|fore the end of the Week the Dutche&s;&s;es Knight gave <HI>Balan</HI> the Order, tho' not though in white Harne&s;s, according to the Cu&s;tom, but in black Armor, with the Shield, be|fore de&s;cribed to you, &s;ignifying the Lo&s;s of his Countrey, and the Impri&s;onment of his Parents. The new Knight then, having thank'd the King, and him, from whom he receiv'd that Honour, entred into his Bark, hoping in a little time to &s;ee and fight his Enemy. But it fell out quite contrary to his expectations; for the &s;econd day after there aro&s;e &s;uch a Tempe&s;t, that from time to and time he expected the lo&s;s of him&s;elf and his Ve&s;&s;el together, which being driven to fro, was at la&s;t ca&s;t upon the I&s;le of <HI>Argenes,</HI> where he went a&s;hore. And to know what Country it was, he took Hor&s;e, and riding towards the Ca&s;tle, where was then the Emperor of <HI>Trebi&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">nd,</HI> as you have been told, he was met by &s;ix of <HI>Axianas</HI> Knights who a&s;&s;ail'd him, to take him and impri&s;on him according to the Cu&s;tom. But he &s;o gallantly defended him&s;elf, that the Event was &s;uch, as you have heard.</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P>How the Infanta <HI>Axiana,</HI> being arriv'd at her Hou&s;e of Plea&s;ure, &s;ent to fetch the <HI>Knight of the Burning Sword</HI> and <HI>Gradamart,</HI> that they might be better lookt to, than where they were, having no Chirurgion, to dre&s;s their Wounds.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>TO continue then the Di&s;cour&s;e of our Hi&s;tory, you &s;hall under&s;tand, that on the morrow, <HI>Balan</HI> recited at large the &s;tate of his affairs to <HI>Perion</HI> and <HI>Li&s;vart.</HI> At which every one was grratly mov'd to compa&s;&s;ion, promi&s;ing him Aid and Suc|co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">, principally the <HI>Knight of the burning Sword,</HI> who de&s;ir'd to be his Friend and Companion: So that they pa&s;s'd afterwards many Fortunes together, as you &s;hall under&s;tand in the &s;equal of this Di&s;cour&s;e. Now it hapned, that the next day, as the Emperor, with the Ladies, and the re&s;t of the Knights, were walking upon the Bridge near the fir&s;t Tower, they perceiv'd coming towards them two Dam&s;els in very good Equipage, accompanying a Litter, cover'd with Velvet, carry'd by two ambling Mules. Being come a little nearer the Knights, they &s;topt, to ask, which among&s;t them was the Emperor of <HI>Trebi&s;ond.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Dam&s;els,</HI> an&s;wer'd the Emperor, <HI>I am he: What is your Plea&s;ure?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Sir,</HI> &s;aid one of the Dam&s;els, <HI>the Infanta</HI> Axiana <HI>my Mi&s;tre&s;s intreats you to &s;end her in this Litter the Knight, that fought ye&s;terday, a&s;&s;uring you, that he &s;hall be every way better treated than he can be in this place, where among&s;t other Reme|dies, there wants a Chirurgion, as &s;he very well knows: And this Courte&s;y &s;he will do him in acknowledgment of that, he &s;hew'd her ye&s;terday. And doubt not Sir, of his being very kindly entertain'd: For my Lady determins to honor him for his Virtue: Therefore con&s;ider, what An&s;wer to make.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Dam&s;el,</HI> reply'd the Emperor, <HI>I &s;hould be greatly &s;atisfy'd to &s;erve your Mi&s;tre&s;s: But as to the Reque&s;t &s;he makes me, I a&s;&s;ure you, I have no farther Power over the Knight, than what him&s;elf will give to my Entreaty. I &s;hall indeed, and willingly, per&s;wade him to obay her, and if you will go along with me, you &s;hall hear, what I will &s;ay to him.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Sir,</HI> &s;aid Balan, <HI>not to give you that trouble, I will, if you plea&s;e&punc; do the me&s;&s;age: And I believe, he will readily hearken to it, &s;eeing the Condition, he is in.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Go then,</HI> an&s;wer'd the Emperor, <HI>and bring us Word, a&s;&s;oon as po&s;&s;ibly you can.</HI></P>
<P>Then <HI>Balan</HI> departed, and went to the <HI>Knight of the Burning Sword,</HI> who was in his Bed by <HI>Gradamart, Gradafilea</HI> bearing them company, and entirely related to him <HI>Axiana</HI>'s Me&s;&s;age, telling him the De&s;ire, &s;he had to treat him, and that two of her Dam&s;els had brought him a Litter in very good Equipage.</P>
<PB N="115" REF="64">
<P><HI>My dear Friend,</HI> an&s;wer'd he, <HI>Axiana does &s;o much for me, that I know not how, during my whole life, I may be able to acknowledge this her Favour; yet will I not for&s;ake my Companion</HI> Gradamart: <HI>So that if &s;he will have one, &s;he mu&s;t have both together.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Well then,</HI> &s;aid <HI>Balan, I will go and give them this An&s;wer, and return to ac|quaint you with their Reply.</HI></P>
<P>Then going forth of the Chamber, he came to the Place, where the Emperor ex|pecting his Return, was di&s;cour&s;ing with the Dam&s;els to whom <HI>Balan</HI> declar'd the Intention of the <HI>Knight of the burning Sowrd:</HI> Which, when they had heard, they an&s;wer'd, that <HI>Axiana</HI> had in like manner commanded them to make the &s;ame Reque&s;t to <HI>Gradamart,</HI> if he were living: For &s;he lov'd him, and much doubted of his being in a wor&s;e Condition.</P>
<P>When <HI>Lucella</HI> under&s;tood, that her Friend was to remove, &s;he chang'd her Colour above ten times in le&s;s than a moments &s;pace, one while pale, pre&s;ently red, now pen&s;ive, then incon&s;tant, di&s;&s;embling neverthele&s;s, as much as was po&s;&s;iible, the amo|rous Pa&s;&s;ion, which caus'd &s;uch an Alteration in her: And with the be&s;t a&s;&s;urance, &s;he could, &s;he return'd to accompany the Queen, and the Dam&s;els, into the Chamber of the wounded Knights, who were without delay carry'd by four Servants, and put into the Litter.</P>
<P>Now the Me&s;&s;engers had not yet taken notice of <HI>Lucella</HI>'s Beauty, which they no &s;ooner beheld, but they dur&s;t to affirm, that Nature had never produc'd any thing, more excellent, or more worthy of Admiration. And immediatly they took their Leave of the Company, the two Knights promi&s;ing the Ladies to make a &s;peedy Return, if it pleas'd Heaven to be a&s;&s;i&s;ting to their Cure.</P>
<P>Removing then, they went gently on, for fear of di&s;turbing the Wounds of the Knights, yet neverthele&s;s they came before Sun-&s;et to <HI>Axiana</HI>'s Palace, which was wonderfully built: For the whole Building was of Ia&s;per, Porphiry, white, gray, and black Marble, with a va&s;t Number of Towers and Turrets, along which were many guilded Pipes, receiving the Waters from four great Parts of the Hou&s;e in a Square, the Walls of which, within and without were enricht with the mo&s;t curious work, that <HI>Apelles</HI> ever wrought, either in Imagery or Painting. To this Palace was adjoyning a Park, containing in compa&s;s &s;ix great Leagues, full of &s;o many Curio&s;ities, that I know not, whether the Palace of <HI>Apolidon</HI> could &s;hew any thing beyond them: For <HI>Zirfea</HI> had employ'd all her Skill to render it perfectly curious, having beautify<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">d with whatever Art or Nature could afford, as you &s;hall hereafter under&s;tand. And tho' the two wounded Knights were in &s;o much Pain, that Re&s;t was much more convenient for them, than their Amu&s;ing them&s;elves, either in beholding or di&s;cour&s;ing about Buildings; yet having heard the Dam&s;els by the way relate the Perfection of the Place, they took &s;o great Plea&s;ure in viewing its Out-&s;ide, that they &s;carce thought of entring in, when <HI>Axiana,</HI> in|form'd of their Arrival, by a Page, came to receive them with &s;uch a Countenance, as
<PB N="116" REF="65"> &s;hew'd her more content and &s;atisfy'd, than if &s;he had regain'd her Ca&s;tle, and Cham|ber of Trea&s;ure, &s;he had lo&s;t.</P>
<P>Which the <HI>Knight of the Burning Sword</HI> perceiving, &s;aid to her: <HI>Madam, you have been &s;o mindful of our Healths, that &s;hould we dye a thou&s;and times in your &s;ervice, yet can we never recompence favour we receive from you: But the as the Sun is natually bright, and cannot be otherwi&s;e; &s;o you being de&s;cended of the hou&s;e, you are, and &s;o well educated, cannot &s;hew your &s;elf other than wi&s;e, prudent, fair, and ver|tuous, u&s;ing Sweetne&s;s and Courte&s;y, as that, with which you are born, and which naturally, accompanies you to render you the mo&s;t accompli&s;ht of Ladies.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Sir Knight,</HI> an&s;wer'd &s;he, <HI>you give me great and unde&s;erv'd Prai&s;es, for that which I could not have omitted, without offending again&s;t the three principal Points, requi&s;it to a Per&s;on of my Condition. The fir&s;t of which is, to acknow|ledge in time of Adver&s;ity the Plea&s;ure one has receiv'd from ones Enemy, letting every one know, that he, who, when afflicted, can requite a Favor, has al&s;o the Means to avenge him&s;elf of the Injuries &s;uffer'd, during his Misfortune. The &s;e|cond, to &s;hew ones &s;elf at all times civil and compa&s;&s;ionate, as occa&s;ion requires. And the third, never &s;o to trouble ones Mind, for any Di&s;contents or Cro&s;&s;es, which may happen, but that Rea&s;on and Di&s;cretion &s;till keep the upper hand. And the&s;e three Points are evidently nece&s;&s;ary to all generous Per&s;ons, for the pre&s;erving their Greatne&s;s always firm and unchangeable: For undecaying Virtue renders a per&s;on much more noble and exalted, than all the corruptible Goods of Fortune, which are always &s;ubject to her Pa&s;&s;ions and Incon&s;tancy, and but too often be&s;tow'd on &s;uch, as never de&s;erv'd them. But 'tis quite otherwi&s;e with Virtue; for he alone obtains it, who does Acts worthy the gaining it: And for it alone, ought men to be e&s;teem'd, and honour'd, yea, and reputed Richer, than if they po&s;&s;e&s;s'd all the Trea|&s;ures of the word: Becau&s;e the true and never fading Riches, is the Renown of good and heroick Actions, perform'd by the vertuous Per&s;on.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Knight of the Burning Sword,</HI> hearing her &s;peak with &s;uch a Grace, conceiv'd a very great E&s;teem for her: But &s;he was Daughter of one of the di&s;creete&s;t Ladies in <HI>A&s;ia,</HI> and of Prince <HI>Olorius</HI> of <HI>Spain,</HI> a mo&s;t wi&s;e and prudent Knight, from whom it would have been difficult for her to have degenerated. And to &s;peak true, when we con&s;ider the tenderne&s;s of her Age joyn'd with her Di&s;cretion, Nature &s;hew'd in her a Ma&s;ter-piece, admirably well de&s;erving the highe&s;t Commendations. Wherefore he re&s;ol'd to do her all the Honor, he could, and &s;he very courteou&s;ly embrac'd him. Then were he and <HI>Gradamart</HI> brought into a fair Chamber, where, being laid in two &s;everal Beds, they were vi&s;ited by the old Knight, whom we formerly mention'd, who, thro' his great skill, and long Experience, &s;av'd their Lives, as he had done of many other valiant men, who held them&s;elves therefore very much oblig'd to him.</P>

<P><HI>FOur whole days did the</HI> Knight of the burning Sword <HI>and</HI> Gradamart, <HI>continue under the Old Mans Hand, without any di&s;cerning of Amendment in them, till towards the end of the Week, when the Feavor left them, and their Wounds be|gan to Heal.</HI> Axiana <HI>in the mean time treated them in the be&s;t manner, &s;he could imagin, and &s;ent to de&s;ire the King of</HI> Sicily, <HI>that he would come and vi&s;it them.

<P><HI>They then being come to the Infanta's Hou&s;e, whil&s;t</HI> Gradafilea <HI>was entertain|ing her Brother</HI> Gradamart, <HI>the King of</HI> Sicily <HI>di&s;cours'd with the</HI> Knight of the burning Sword, <HI>who falling from one matter to another, the Knight began to &s;ay to him:</HI> Sir, tho' the little Service I have hitherto done you, is &s;o far from de&s;er|ving any Recompence, that it merits not the lea&s;t Thanks, neverthele&s;s, con&s;ider|ing your Goodne&s;s, Liberality, and courteous Di&s;po&s;ition, as you al&s;o, I believe, have already &s;ome A&s;&s;urance, how much I am yours, and into what danger I would put my Per&s;on for any thing, that might redound to your Service; I have taken the boldne&s;s to make you the Reque&s;t, you will hear. You know, Sir, in what man|ner the <HI>Chamber of Trea&s;ure</HI> was Conquer'd, and the Guards &s;lain, at which (as 'tis to be thought) the Infanta <HI>Axiana</HI> receiv'd a double Di&s;content: And never|thele&s;s for my de&s;i&s;ting at her Reque&s;t from the Combat again&s;t her Knight <HI>Lu|cencio,</HI> which was as great a Benefit to my &s;elf, as to him, &s;he has taken &s;uch care of my Health, that, laying a&s;ide all the ill Will, &s;he might rea&s;onably bear me, &s;he has &s;o preferr'd Virtue, that 'twere impo&s;&s;ible for the greate&s;t Prince in the World to be more honour'd, or better treated: Which has con&s;train'd me, Sir, humbly to be&s;eech you, that you will be pleas'd to give me, what we have won from her, to the end I may make her a Pre&s;ent of it, acknowledging in &s;ome manner the great Civility &s;he has &s;hewn me.</P>
<P><HI>The King, who de&s;ir'd nothing more than to plea&s;e and &s;atisfy him, being very glad of this Overture, thus an&s;wer'd him:</HI> My dear Friend, I could wi&s;h you had askt al&s;o of me the three be&s;t Citys of my Kingdoms, that I might have had an Op|portunity of &s;hewing you how &s;en&s;ible I am of the Obligations you have laid on me, who owe you even my Life: as for what you now reque&s;t of me, you alone have the Ab&s;olute Right to di&s;po&s;e of it, at your plea&s;ure, having purchas'd it with your blood; it &s;eems therefore injurious to me, to ask me that which is already your own, and in which I have no part: but if you plea&s;e to accept of any thing that belongs to me, you &s;hall freely have it, how dear &s;oever it is to me.</P>
<PB N="118" REF="66">
<P><HI>The</HI> Knight of the burning Sword <HI>very humbly thank'd him. This Di&s;cour&s;e was &s;carce ended, when the Infanta, who had been to vi&s;it her Friend</HI> Lucencio, <HI>came in. The King immediately went to &s;alute her, with his Knee, in a manner, to the Ground, and &s;he, who was of an Accompli&s;ht Behaviour receiv'd him very humbly. Then they &s;at down in two Chairs, near to the Knight, who, addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to her, thus began his Di&s;cour&s;e:</HI> Madam, you have already done me &s;uch Favours, that 'tis impo&s;&s;ible for &s;o poor a Knight, as I am, ever to return you &s;ui|table Thanks: I have neverthele&s;s, by my Entreaties, &s;o far prevail'd with the King, that he has, of his Liberality, been pleas'd to be&s;tow on me the Place, you lo&s;t &s;ome few days &s;ince, to the end I may re&s;tore it into your hands, which I very willingly do: entreating you, that of your wonted Goodne&s;s, you will pardon me the death of your people, who (undoubtedly) ended their daies, more thro' the ill Cu&s;tom of the place, they kept, than for any De&s;ire I had to do you a di&s;courte&s;y. Therefore, Madam, with Thanks to the King, you will plea&s;e to accept this pre|&s;ent, and to e&s;teem me, as one, who would hazard his life, and whatever el&s;e is dear to him, for your Service.</P>
<P><HI>Tho'</HI> Axiana <HI>was exceedingly overjoy'd at her &s;o ea&s;y recovering, what &s;he de&s;pai|red of, yet concealing the Exce&s;s of her Ioy, &s;he mode&s;tly thus an&s;wer'd him:</HI> In|deed, good Knight, the Offer you &s;o liberally make me, and the Di&s;plea&s;ure I have receiv'd in lo&s;ing, what you have gain'd from me and mine, put me in great confu|&s;ion; becau&s;e, con&s;idering in what manner my place has been conquer'd, and then re&s;tor'd, and put into my hands, my honour &s;eems not however to be &s;atisfied, un|le&s;s the Death of my men were reveng'd as &s;everely as the greatne&s;s of the Offence de&s;erves, not &s;o much in re&s;pect of them, as of my per&s;on, again&s;t which, the prin|cipal Injury has been committed, and which ought to have a &s;uitable &s;atisfaction. And on the other &s;ide, the Favour, Benefit, and Honour I receive from the King and you, &s;ummons me to forget all pa&s;t Offences, not &s;o much for the value of the thing you pre&s;ent me, as to take away the Opinion, that might be conceived, not only of my ingratitude, but that the cau&s;e of my Refu&s;al proceeds from a De|&s;pair of ever being able to return you the like: Which, the Gods forbid &s;hould befall <HI>Axiana,</HI> and much le&s;s, that &s;he &s;hould &s;hew in the State and Rank &s;he bears any mean &s;piritedne&s;s, which is a Fault, that never &s;he or any of her Lineage were guilty of. And therefore conforming the Time to my Fortune, my Thanks for the Re&s;titution you make me, &s;hall be &s;uch, that I wait for &s;ome time to requite you, not as for a Benefit be&s;tow'd on the Queen of <HI>Argenes</HI> Daughter, but as a bounty, proceeding from &s;uch noble Per&s;ons to me, who expected it not. In the mean time you &s;hall have, for a pledge, my good Will, with what ever el&s;e is in my power.</P>
<P>Ah! Madam, <HI>&s;aid the King,</HI> I will no longer contend with you&punc; well knowing, that your Courte&s;y can overcome a much better &s;peaker than I am: but let it &s;uffice you, that all tho&s;e, who &s;ee you, fall into a De&s;ire of doing you &s;er|vice,

<P><HI>Now</HI> Axiana <HI>had not yet perceiv'd</HI> Gradafilea, <HI>who, to hear what they &s;aid, left her Brother, and came towards her. Then they &s;aluted each other very courteou&s;ly.

<ARGUMENT>
<P>How the Emperor of <HI>Trebi&s;ond,</HI> the King of <HI>Sicily,</HI> and all the others, as well Knights, as Ladies, and Gentlewoman, that were in the Ca&s;tle of the Cham|ber of Trea&s;ure, went to &s;ee <HI>Axiana:</HI> And of the Wonders &s;he &s;hew'd them.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>SO well did the did Knight order tho&s;e he had undertaken to cure, that he &s;et them on their Legs &s;ound and lu&s;ty: At which the Infanta <HI>Axiana</HI> much rejoycing, and de&s;irous to treat the Emperor and his Company, reque&s;ted the <HI>Knight of the Burning Sword,</HI> and <HI>Gradamart,</HI> to go, and de&s;ire their Company at her hou&s;e, where &s;he de&s;ign'd to fea&s;t them.

Then the two Knights told tho&s;e of the Ca&s;tle <HI>Axiana</HI>'s De&s;ire, to &s;atisfy which, they re&s;olv'd to &s;et forth immediatly.

<P>Now as &s;he &s;aluted them one after the other, &s;eeing the great Beauty of <HI>Lucella,</HI> of which &s;he had been told, &s;he could not forbear &s;aying to her: <HI>In my Con&s;cience, Madam, you are the compleate&s;t Beauty, I ever &s;aw in my life and I no more wonder, that the Adventure of my Ca&s;tel is ended, the Gods having be&s;tow'd on you &s;o great Excellence.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Li&s;vart,</HI> who heard this Di&s;cour&s;e, and the Prai&s;es, which <HI>Axiana</HI> gave the Prince&s;s, de&s;iring in &s;ome &s;ort to acknowledge the Plea&s;ure, he receiv'd by it, &s;pake thus to her: <HI>By my Faith Madam you have in my opinion no cau&s;e to complain of them: For if they have given this Infanta any Beauty, you al&s;o have &s;o good a &s;hare of it, that you come not far behind her.</HI></P>
<P>And to &s;peak Truth, after Lucella, one could not ea&s;ily have found any one, that equall'd her; and yet &s;he could not forbear &s;miling and blu&s;hing together. She would not however conte&s;t any longer, but changing the Di&s;cour&s;e, brought them in|to the Hail, where the Tables were cover'd for d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">nner, and they were &s;o abundantly &s;erv'd with all &s;orts of Delicacies, that 'twas to be admir'd.</P>

<P><HI>Yes indeed</HI> an&s;wer'd the Queen, <HI>'tis what we reque&s;t of you.</HI></P>
<P>Then they arofe from their Places, and not to tire them&s;el<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">es over much, &s;ent for their Hor&s;es, on which being mounted, they entred fir&s;t into a great Park, part of which was curiou&s;ly planted with Rows of Orange-trees, Lemon-trees, Myrcles, Pomegranates, Cypres, Lawrels, Lentisk, Pines, Fir-tres, Palm-trees, Olive-trees, and &s;everal others, wonderfully plea&s;ant. A little higher, on a &s;mall ri&s;ing, was a Thicket of Codars &amp; Plain-trees, whither repair'd all &s;orts of Animals, wild and tame. And at the foot ran a Rivulet, proceeding from many plea&s;ant Foun|tains, which water'd the Place, where 'twas convenient; in the mid&s;t of which there was an high Pillar of Amber, that ca&s;t forth &s;uch abundance of Water, as made a &s;pacious Lake. Then going on the left hand, they entred into a long Walk, &s;et on each &s;ide with Elms, Lime-trees, and Sycomores, which &s;o &s;haded it, that the Sun in the height of Summer could not have offended the Eye of any one, and to re&s;t ones &s;elf, there were, on the Sides of it, Arbors of Woodbines and Box, entermix'd with Laurels and Laylacks. And in the mid&s;t was a Round of an hundred yards over, where were <HI>Pallas, Juno,</HI> and <HI>Venus</HI> of white Marble, who look on <HI>Paris,</HI> &s;leeping on a Rock of Chry&s;tal, whence i&s;&s;u'd another Fountain, in which they all took &s;o much Plea&s;ure, that they had not any thoughts of Returning, when there aro&s;e &s;o ob&s;cure &amp; dark cloud a Cloud, that they all lo&s;t &s;ight of each other, and &s;uddenly heard a &s;er|pent hi&s;s, and beat his Wings, &s;o that the whole Park re&s;ounded the Noi&s;e.

Yes certainly were you, and in &s;uch manner, that you thought immediately to dye: For the la&s;t mention'd Fountain was chang'd into &s;o great a Fire, that the Flames &s;eem'd by little and little to have &s;eiz'd on the whole Park, tho&s;e who beheld this wonder, expecting nothing but a mi&s;erable and de&s;perate end, and cur&s;ing <HI>Axiana,</HI> who had &s;o &s;ubtilly b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ought them thither, to take, as they thought, vengeance for the Di&s;plea&s;ure, &s;he had receiv'd of them.

Then the Darkne&s;s vani&s;h|ing, and the Heavens becoming clear and bright, they all found them&s;elves in the

<P>Wherefore the Knights, knowing their Illu&s;ion, and pa&s;t Fear, fell a laughing; &s;o did not the Ladies, but trembled like the Leaves on the Tree, what fair Words &s;oever <HI>Axiana</HI> gave them, who would have brought them farther: But <HI>Lucella</HI> very farely told her, &s;he would not for any thing in the world go on, unle&s;s &s;he promis'd to free her from the&s;e Planta&s;ms.

<P>Wherefore <HI>Axiana</HI> gave her <HI>Li&s;vart</HI> Sword, &s;aying to her: <HI>Madam, the better to &s;ecure you, take this Staff, which has &s;uch Vertue, that no Enchantment can hurt the Per&s;on, who bears it: And for this cau&s;e did I reque&s;t the Lord, who&s;e it is, to lend it me at our entrance into this Park. Which he did, and I deliver it to you, to defend your&s;elf &amp; the re&s;t, if you are a&s;&s;aulted with the like fear, as you have been.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Certainly</HI> an&s;wer'd <HI>Li&s;vart, I &s;hould willingly choo&s;e &s;uch Defence from her, and &s;o, that I am ready to confe&s;s, that &s;he and &s;uch like have more Power over me tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter"> any one, who &s;hould be arm'd, and in a will to &s;ight me.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Well then,</HI> &s;aid <HI>Lucella, on this word I receive it, and will defend you, if Occa|&s;ion offers.</HI></P>
<P>They thus je&s;ting one at the other, the <HI>Knight of the burning Sword,</HI> who thought, that <HI>Li&s;vart</HI> &s;pake thro' Affection, and that he was in love with <HI>Lucella,</HI> en|tred into &s;o &s;trong a Iealou&s;y, that he would gladly have found a Pretence to have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ought him pre&s;ently: But neither Place nor Opportunity being di&s;pos'd for it, he kept in his heart this ill Will, to make him &s;ometime repent it, tho' this Su&s;picion was very unju&s;tly conceiv'd.

</ARGUMENT>
<P>IN the beginning of this Hi&s;tory, you have been told, how King <HI>Amadis</HI> took a &s;ingular Delight, in &s;eeing the Feats of Arms, every day perform'd by the Dut|che&s;s of <HI>Savoys</HI> Knight, who kept the Kay, whether he had caus'd his Tents and Pavilions to be brought, &s;o that he &s;tay'd there four whole Months: during which 'tis incredible, what a Number of Shields were lo&s;t by &s;everal gallant Men, accor|ding to the Cu&s;tom, e&s;tabli&s;ht at the Pa&s;&s;age. At which, the King conceived &s;uch a Love for the Knight, that, to draw him to his Service, and continual Re&s;idence about his Per&s;on, he &s;hew'd him great Honour and Sign of Love.</P>
<P>Now it hapned one day among&s;t others, that his Hunt&s;men brought him Word of a great Wild Boar, which they had found in a Thicket near the Sea-&s;ide. The King, who lov'd Hunting, commanded pre&s;ently the Toils to be &s;pread, and with his Grey-hounds, Hounds, and other great Dogs brought him to a Bay, and at la&s;t kill'd him with a Bore-Spear. And becau&s;e he found him&s;elf weary, he went to re|fre&s;h him&s;elf on the Sand, where he had not been long, when he &s;aw a Boat, brought to the Shore by two Mariners, and with them a Dam&s;el, carrying on her Shoulders two Giants Heads, one a Mans, the other a Womans. She, of whom I &s;peak to you, &s;hew'd &s;o much &s;orrow, that a pityle&s;s heart would have been mov'd to com|pa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>The King, and tho&s;e who were with him, drew near to hear the Cau&s;e of this Sorrow, and what Adventure brought this Woman thither. But &s;he prevented them, asking them with Tears in her Eyes, if they could direct her to King <HI>Amadis,</HI> the Rampart and Refuge of &s;uch de&s;olate Per&s;ons, as &s;he was.</P>
<P>The King hearing, that &s;he de&s;ir'd to &s;peak with him, an&s;wer'd mildly: <HI>Dam|&s;el, I am he, what would you have with me?</HI></P>
<P>At this word the Giante&s;s pro&s;trated her &s;elf at his Feet, and increa&s;ing her tears and &s;ighs &s;aid to him: <HI>Alas! if in the time, when you were a Knight Errant, you &s;ought &s;trange Adventures, to repair Wrongs and Outrages, e&s;pecially &s;uch, as were done to Widows and Orphans, now that you are King, Rea&s;on obliges you not to leave this &s;o good, holy, and ju&s;t Cu&s;tom. For GOD be&s;tows not his Favours and great Benefits on &s;uch, as you are, but for the Pre&s;ervation of Ju&s;tice, and A&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Poor, who are all &s;tript of Relief, as I am.</HI></P>
<P><HI>My Friend,</HI> an&s;wer'd the King, <HI>you &s;ay true, and certainly I will do &s;o, if I can, whenever I &s;hall have Opportunity: Wherefore delay not to acquaint me with your Grief, a&s;&s;uring you, that I will remedy it as far as I am able.</HI></P>
<PB N="125" REF="69" MS="y">
<P><HI>O good Prince,</HI> &s;aid &s;he, <HI>with this hope I am come to you, and mo&s;t humbly be|&s;eech you to grant me a gift, which 'tis nece&s;&s;ary you &s;hould do, if you intend to re|venge me of the wrong that is done me.</HI></P>
<P><HI>I grant it you,</HI> an&s;wer'd the King.</P>
<P><HI>Under&s;tand, Sir,</HI> &s;aid &s;he, <HI>that the Gift you have given me, is, that you alone, being Arm'd, enter pre&s;ently into my Boat, to the end you may revenge me of the wicked Per&s;on that has &s;lain my Father and Mother, who&s;e Heads the&s;e are: and the Remainder, Sir, I will tell you at lei&s;ure, as we are &s;ailing.</HI></P>
<P><HI>In good faith,</HI> an&s;wer'd the King, <HI>it &s;hall not be my fault, if your Will is not ex|ecuted: for I will follow you, where-ever you de&s;ire.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Certainly,</HI> &s;aid the Dam&s;el, <HI>this Confidence I have always had in your Vertue and Goodne&s;s, therefore &s;end for your Arms, and let us go.</HI></P>
<P>The King call'd the Count <HI>Gandalin,</HI> and commanded him to fetch them with out &s;aying a word to the Queen, or any other, till &s;uch time as he was departed. The Count obey'd his Command, tho' very unwillingly: but knowing his Ma&s;ters di|&s;po&s;ition, who would rather dye, than break his word, he went on. Nor was it long, e're he return'd, and the King arm'd him&s;elf, bidding King <HI>Arban</HI> acquaint the Queen, with what he had &s;een, and de&s;ire her in his Name not to be troubled for him. Then he went into the Boat, and, without knowing whether he went, be|gan to Sail, leaving his People in a wonderful fear of lo&s;ing him.</P>
<P>And becau&s;e you may, Readers, think it &s;trange, that this good King, who was four&s;core years old, could yet undertake the Execution of &s;uch an Adventure, you mu&s;t under&s;tand, that in his time the mo&s;t magnanimous Knight, and of the greate&s;t Courage, that could be found. Nor were the days of Men &s;o &s;hort then, as they are now: for they liv'd &s;ome Two Hundred, nay &s;ome Three Hundred Years and lon|ger. And which is more, the Vertue of the Water, wherewith <HI>Urganda</HI> the <HI>Un|known</HI> wa&s;ht him in the Palace of <HI>Apolidon,</HI> when &s;he enchanted him, was very Advantageous to him in this Affair.</P>
<P>But to return to our Story, King <HI>Arban,</HI> having follow'd King <HI>Amadis</HI> with his Eye, till he was out of &s;ight, came to the Queen, and acquainted her with the King's Command, at which &s;he became &s;o troubled, that fetching a deep &s;igh, &s;he began to &s;ay: <HI>Good GOD, the King's great Heart is an Enemy to his Per&s;on, and to me, &s;eeing the Dangers it expo&s;es him to at every turn! Alas! is it not time for him now to re&s;t, and leave &s;uch youthful matters to be undertaken by &s;o great a Number of good Knights, who de&s;ire nothing el&s;e?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Madam,</HI> an&s;wer'd <HI>Angriote, you &s;ay true: but what? the King, who is born to gain to him&s;elf alone the Honour of all, de&s;ires thus to do, and to leave nothing behind for us, thinking, by the great Benefits, he be&s;tows on us, &s;ufficiently to &s;atisfy us for the Service and good Will, we bear him.</HI></P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P>How <HI>Malfadea</HI> the Giante&s;s related her Misfortune to King <HI>Amadis:</HI> and of the Di&s;cour&s;e, they had together.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>KIng</HI> Amadis, <HI>being thus gone off from the Coa&s;t of great</HI> Britain, <HI>and &s;eeing his Guide a little pacify'd, reque&s;ted her to acquaint him with the occa&s;ion of her Parents Death, and her Di&s;content.</HI></P>
<P><HI>This &s;he willingly granted, &s;aying to him:</HI> Your Maje&s;ty will be pleas'd to un|der&s;tand, that my Father was Lord of the great <HI>Siclades,</HI> &s;o call'd for being lon|ger and larger than any other of the four and fifty I&s;lands. And tho' he was a Giant, yet had he many good and vertuous Cu&s;toms: he was very ju&s;t, compa&s;&s;ionate, and a Practi&s;er of friendly Ho&s;pitality towards his Neighbours. One of which, who was a wicked and traiterous Di&s;&s;embler, abu&s;ing this my Fathers Courte&s;y and good Nature, pretended to be &s;o much his Friend, that he lov'd him above all others.</P>
<P>He, of whom I &s;peak, and who is nam'd <HI>Ma&s;caron,</HI> came not above fifteen days &s;ince, with a Cou&s;in of his into the great <HI>Siclades,</HI> where they were very well re|ceiv'd. Now the next day after dinner, this Villain askt my Father, that he might have my Company to walk in the Garden. My Father, innocent of the Ra&s;cals Malice, commanded me to go along with him: and <HI>Ma&s;caron</HI> and I were &s;ome time together without his &s;peaking any thing that might di&s;plea&s;e me: but at la&s;t he pray'd me to grant him my Love.</P>
<P>I then, being much amaz'd, frankly an&s;wer'd him, that I would rather dye, than do this Injury to my Lineage, &s;etting before his Eyes the good Entertainment, and great Reception, my Father had given him, to which he ought to have regard.</P>
<P><HI>Say you &s;o?</HI> &s;aid he. <HI>Yet mu&s;t you obey me, whether you will or no: neverthele&s;s</HI> I <HI>pray you, it may be by Amity, and not by force.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Certainly,</HI> an&s;wer'd I then to him, <HI>I would fir&s;t kill my &s;elf with mine own hands.</HI></P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding this, my Refu&s;al hindred him not from attempting to defile me by force, which made me cry out &s;o loud, that my Father, who was then di&s;cour|&s;ing with <HI>Ma&s;carons</HI> Cou&s;in, came to my A&s;&s;i&s;tance, asking me the cau&s;e of my Cry.</P>
<P><HI>Alas,</HI> &s;aid I, <HI>this Villain would have di&s;honour'd me by force.</HI></P>
<P>My Father, not without cau&s;e, provokt hereat, &s;toop'd down to take up a &s;tick, which lay at his Feet, and before he could get up again, the Traytor, drawing a Scymeter, which hung at his &s;ide, gave him &s;uch a Blow on the neck, that he &s;e|parated his head from his Body.</P>
<PB N="127" REF="70">
<P>Then I poor wretch began in &s;uch &s;ort to howl and lament, that my &s;orrowful Mother came to me, who finding my Father thus murder'd, and the Scymeter in the hands of his murderer, flew at him, and like a furious Lione&s;s, which &s;ees her man, overwhelmed with De&s;pair, could in &s;uch a ca&s;e do. And &s;he had with|out doubt kill'd him, but that the other, taking his part, fir&s;t threw my Mother on the Ground, and then drawing his Sword, murder'd her.</P>
<P>Then <HI>Ma&s;caron</HI> took me by the hair, telling me, that, to make me &s;uffer the more he would not kill me, as he had done the re&s;t, but would force me on the Bodies of my murder'd Parents, that I might receive the greater injury: and thus he executed his damn'd and unhappy Will, what Re&s;i&s;tance or Threat &s;oever I made him.</P>
<P>Then he kickt me on the Belly, &s;aying to me: <HI>Go, wretched Creature, &s;eek who may honour thee more, or re&s;tore thee the E&s;tate, thou expected&s;t to enjoy for the future.</HI></P>
<P>And leaving me alone, he, and his Cou&s;in return'd to the Ca&s;tle, where ha|ving mo&s;t inhumanly butcher'd many poor Servants, they took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it, and keep it &s;till.</P>
<P>Which I &s;eeing, took the Heads, you may here behold, and entred into this Boat, attended by this Servant of mine, who has brought me to you for Refuge: and &s;o indeed I commanded him, having often heard it affirm'd, that you never fail'd your A&s;&s;i&s;tance to any poor de&s;olate Woman.</P>
<P>In this manner, Sir, all has pa&s;t, and this is the unhappy end of tho&s;e, from whom I had my Life.</P>
<P><HI>Then &s;he fell a weeping &s;o bitterly, that it &s;eem'd, as if &s;he would have melted into Tears. At which the Kings heart was in &s;uch manner touch'd with Compa&s;|&s;ion, that he could &s;carce forbear weeping: wherefore he &s;aid to her:</HI> This certainly is the greate&s;t and mo&s;t Villamous Trea&s;on, that could be imagin'd, and which I have good hopes not to leave unpuni&s;h'd.</P>
<P>Alas, Sir, <HI>an&s;wer'd &s;he,</HI> I be&s;eech GOD to be aiding to you herein.</P>
<P><HI>Thus went King</HI> Amadis <HI>and</HI> Malfadea <HI>di&s;cour&s;ing with &s;o good a Wind, that the Thirteenth Day after they arriv'd within Twenty Miles of the great</HI> Siclades. <HI>Which the Mariners let the King under&s;tand, a&s;&s;uring him, they &s;hould come to Harbor the next day before eight a Clock.</HI></P>
<P>Well then, <HI>an&s;wer'd the King,</HI> we &s;hall &s;ee whether <HI>Ma&s;caron</HI> or I &s;hall have the faire&s;t Mi&s;tre&s;s.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXXVI.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>How the Emperor of <HI>Trebi&s;ond,</HI> the King of <HI>Sicily,</HI> and their Company, failing by Night, there pa&s;s'd by them a Boat, in which was a Knight, and a Lady that wept bitterly.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>WE not long &s;ince told you, in what manner the Emperor and his Company put to Sea at their departure from the I&s;le of <HI>Argenes,</HI> at which there was not any of them, but was greatly pleas'd, hoping to go &s;trait to <HI>Trebi&s;ond:</HI> but they counted without their Ho&s;t; and indeed very great Dammage would have been caus'd by it: to prevent which <HI>Alquifa</HI> was &s;ent to them, as you will under&s;tand in the following Chapter.</P>
<P>This Company then Sailing the &s;pace of a whole Month, without knowing whi|ther, or which way they went, the Ve&s;&s;el being guided of it &s;elf without any Pilot or Governour, (for &s;o had the wife <HI>Alquifa</HI> ordain'd) it one night hapned, that the <HI>Knight of the burning Sword,</HI> not being able to Sleep for thinking on his Love, heard the Moans of a Woman, lamenting, as he thought, and bitterly weeping: wherefore he awakned his Companion <HI>Gradamart,</HI> to whom he bare a &s;ingular Friend&s;hip, and askt him, whether he had heard this Complaint: <HI>for,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>it &s;eems to me to be &s;ome of our Dam&s;els.</HI></P>
<P><HI>I have well heard the Complaint,</HI> an&s;wer'd <HI>Gradamart, but it comes from far|ther off, and to &s;hew 'tis &s;o, the Water carries away the noi&s;e by little and little.</HI></P>
<P><HI>God never help me then,</HI> &s;aid the <HI>Knight of the Burning Sword, if I do not go to know, what it means.</HI></P>
<P><HI>And do you think,</HI> an&s;wer'd <HI>Gradamart, that I will &s;tay behind?</HI></P>
<P>Then they got ha&s;tily up, and wrapping them&s;elves in their Cloaks, came upon the Deck, where they enquir'd of the Mariners, if they had &s;een any one pa&s;s that way, who wept or made any noi&s;e?</P>
<P><HI>Yes,</HI> an&s;wer'd &s;ome of them, <HI>'twas a Dam&s;el, whom a Knight carries away in a Boat, with two Oars.</HI></P>
<P><HI>As God &s;hall help me,</HI> &s;aid the <HI>Knight of the burning Sword, he forces her then, and 'twould ill become me to have &s;o long born Arms, and not to remedy it; and 'tis probable, I heard not this noi&s;e without the Will of the Heavenly Powers, who would have me to look after it. And therefore, Sir</HI> Gradamart, <HI>I de&s;ire you to help me arm my &s;elf: for I would not for any thing in the world delay to follow them in our Skiff, with one or two of our Mariners.</HI></P>
<P><HI>How,</HI> an&s;wer'd <HI>Gradamart, do you think my Friend&s;hip to you &s;o little, that I would let you go thus alone? On my &s;oul, tho' you &s;o far di&s;dain'd me, yet will I not for&s;ake you, without having &s;hare in the good or evil, that may befall you by it.</HI></P>
<P>When the <HI>Knight of the burning Sword</HI> heard him &s;peak with &s;uch Affection, dou|ting, that he had di&s;pleas'd him, he embrac'd him, and &s;aid to him: <HI>Pardon me, my
<PB N="129" REF="71"> dear Friend, for I &s;wear to you by our great Gods, that no other thing made me u&s;e this Language to you, but the fear of over toiling you: for I have more plea|&s;ure in your Company, than in any other I can keep. And therefore I promi&s;e you, that I will not henceforth tran&s;gre&s;s your Commands, but di&s;po&s;e of me, as you &s;hall plea&s;e.</HI></P>
<P>Then <HI>Gradamart</HI> made a &s;ign to the Mariners to let down the Skiff into the Sea, and in the mean time they went to Arm them&s;elves the mo&s;t &s;ecretly they could, fear|ing, le&s;t the King, or &s;ome other, might divert their Enterprize. Being Arm'd, they went forth of the great Ship, taking only two Men to guide them, whom they commanded to &s;teer their Cour&s;e that way, they had heard the voice complain charg|ing the others on their Lives to &s;ay nothing of their Departure, till the next mor|ning, when they &s;hould, in their Names, be&s;eech the Emperor to &s;tay for them two days, if it were po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>Then the Skiff began to Sail, and tho&s;e of the Ship did, as he had commanded them: for day being come, the King of <HI>Sicily,</HI> thinking to go and vi&s;it the <HI>Knight of the burning Sword,</HI> and not finding him, where he was wont to te&s;t, knew from the Mariners, in what manner <HI>Gradamart</HI> and he, was departed, at which he was very much di&s;pleas'd, as was al&s;o <HI>Lucella,</HI> till &s;he knew, what they had reque&s;ted of the Emperor, which was to &s;tay for them.</P>
<P>But a Tempe&s;t, ari&s;ing at break of day, contradicted it: &s;o that 'twas impo&s;&s;ible for them to bring the Ship to Anchor, but they were forc'd to remove, whether they would or no, and follow Fortune, <HI>Alquifa</HI> per&s;wading them, that all this was or|dain'd by My&s;tery, add that the <HI>Knight of the burning Sword</HI> and <HI>Gradamart</HI> would be found again in time.

<ARGUMENT>
<P>How King <HI>Amadis</HI> went a &s;hore in the great <HI>Siclades,</HI> and &s;ought again&s;t <HI>Ma&s;ca|ron:</HI> And of the Danger, he was in, from which he was deliver'd by the <HI>Knight of the Burning Sword,</HI> and <HI>Gradamart,</HI> who came thither in good time for him.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>GRadamart,</HI> and the <HI>Knight of the Burning Sword,</HI> caus'd their two Mariners to row with all the &s;peed they could, that they might overtake him, who carry'd away the Dam&s;el, as you have been told, whom they di&s;cover'd about break of day, at wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ch they receiv'd great Satisfaction, hoping he &s;hould never e&s;cape from them. And following him with great ha&s;t, when it had been now day a full hour, they &s;aw him go a &s;hore on a neighbouring I&s;land, and one of tho&s;e, who guided the Boat, en|ter into a &s;trong Ca&s;tle, whence he &s;oon return'd to the Knight, who &s;tay'd for him on the Sand.</P>
<PB N="130" REF="72">
<P>Then they &s;tay'd a while together, and a little after perceiv'd coming towards them a Giant compleatly arm'd, and with him another Giant, and &s;ome Number of Peo|ple unarm'd: Wherefore the Knight embrac'd his Shield, &amp; lacing down his Hel|met, took his Sword in his hand, and march'd &s;traight to the Giant, who put him|&s;elf in like readine&s;s to fight. Then they began &s;o furiou&s;ly to charge each other, that the &s;parks of Fire flew from their Armor, as from a Furnace, blown with a Smiths Bellows. And thus they held on, curting each others Shields, and un|riveting their Armor, &s;o that the be&s;t of them was in a manner naked, the Knight of The Boat &s;hewing him&s;elf &s;o Active, Couragious, and Nimble, that he often made his Enemy lo&s;e his Blow, and treated him &s;o ill, that the Blood ran out in many places from his Fle&s;h.</P>
<P>At which the Giant grew very fearful, and &s;eeing his End near, cry'd out with a loud voice: <HI>Cou&s;in, Cou&s;in, and you my men, revenge me of this Devil: For if he were Mortal, he could never have done, what you have &s;een.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Ah Villain,</HI> &s;aid the Knight, <HI>do&s;t thou think thus to pre&s;erve thy Life? By my head, all the help of the&s;e Traitors &s;hall not &s;ave thee from my hands.</HI></P>
<P>Having &s;aid this, he began to pre&s;s him more clo&s;e, than he had done all the day, and the Giant did nothing but parry to his Blows, expecting his Men, who were all gone to fetch their Arms at the Ca&s;tle. Whence they ha&s;tily return'd, and fell upon the Knight of the Boat, whom they encompa&s;t on all &s;ides.</P>
<P>Now a little before the <HI>Knight of the burning Sword</HI> and <HI>Gradamart,</HI> who had from a far, &s;een the beginning of the Fight, began to &s;ay to one another: <HI>Behold, how much we were deceiv'd: He, who, we thought, carry'd away the Dam&s;el by force is come to revenge her of &s;ome Injury, &s;he has receiv'd from this Giant: Let us ap|proach, and &s;ee, how 'twill go.</HI></P>
<P>Then they commanded their Mariners to draw to the &s;hore, and the nearer they approacht, the more they wondred, who he was, that fought &s;o valiantly, and, as they might plainly &s;ee, manag'd his Enemy at his Plea&s;ure. But they perceiv'd the A&s;&s;i&s;tance come, and a&s;&s;ail him on all &s;ides: Neverthele&s;s the Knight &s;o well defen|ded him&s;elf, &s;eeing his Death before his Eyes, that he &s;eem'd, as if he had not &s;truck a Blow all the day, tho' he had to do with two Giants, and twenty others, as well Servants, as E&s;quires, by whom he was &s;o mole&s;ted, that 'twas a Wonder, how he could bear up again&s;t them.</P>
<P><HI>Gradamart,</HI> and the <HI>Knight of the burning Sword</HI> who were in their Skiff, making towards the Shore, drew near the Boat, in which the Dam&s;el was remaining, who, wringing her Hands, and tearing her Hair, made the dolefule&s;t Lamentation in the world, cur&s;ing and banning Fortune, which was &s;o contrary and injurious to her. Then the <HI>Knight of the burning &s;word</HI> askt her, why &s;he lamented in that manner.</P>
<P><HI>Alas! Sir</HI> an&s;wer'd the, <HI>if there is in you any goodne&s;s&punc; for GOD's &s;ake &s;uccor this good Knight, who has, for my right, undertaken this hard Combat again&s;t the
<PB N="131" REF="72"> mo&s;t cruel and traitorous Giant, that ever was born of Woman, who, violating his Faith and Promi&s;e: thus di&s;loyally cau&s;es King</HI> Amadis <HI>to be a&s;&s;aulted, whom you may &s;ee in the danger he is for my &s;ake.</HI></P>
<P>When the <HI>Knight of the Burning Sword</HI> heard the Dam&s;el &s;ay, that he, who fought again&s;t &s;o many, was the King of Great <HI>Britain,</HI> he greatly wondred, and &s;pake thus to <HI>Gradamart: Indeed, I believe that whatever Fame has heretofore publi&s;ht of him, is true, and yet it is nothing in re&s;pect of what I &s;ee with my two Eyes: Wherefore I will never con&s;ent to his being thus outrag'd by the&s;e Villains, but will help him to my power, tho' I am &s;ure he hates me more than any man living. And neverthele&s;s, I think my &s;elf happy, that I am come in time to let him know, that (&s;etting hatred a&s;ide) I am more a Lover of Vertue than Enmity: It being a more commendable thing to vanqui&s;h ones &s;elf, than all others. Therefore my Companion, I be&s;eech you, let us cha&s;ti&s;e the&s;e Traitors: For Knight-hood is principally ordain'd for &s;uch occa&s;ions.</HI></P>
<P>Then they went upon the Sand, and Embracing their Shields, fiercely A&s;&s;ailed tho&s;e, who held the King thus be&s;ieged, the <HI>Knight of the burning Sword,</HI> crying: <HI>Be gone, Villains, be gone you &s;hall all dye for having thus laid hands on the be&s;t King in the World.</HI></P>
<P>And at the &s;ame time, he gave &s;uch a Blow with his Sword, to the fir&s;t he met, that he cleft his Iron Cap, and his Head, even to the Shoulders. Then thru&s;ting him&s;elf into the Croud, he &s;truck on the right and left with &s;uch force, that whom he firmly hit, had no need of a Chirurgion. <HI>Gradamart</HI> on the other &s;ide, did not much le&s;s, as, who was of a Giantly Rare, an hardy and valiant Knight, and he would gladly let King <HI>Amadis</HI> know, that for &s;ake of <HI>Li&s;vart</HI> of <HI>Greece,</HI> with whom his Si&s;ter was &s;o much in Love, he willingly employ'd his Per&s;on in his Service.</P>
<P>Now <HI>Amadis</HI> was at that time very much wounded, neverthele&s;s, finding him&s;elf a&s;&s;i&s;ted, and by &s;uch gallant men, had his Heart &s;o rais'd, that he recover'd new &s;trength, and &s;mote <HI>Ma&s;caron</HI> &s;o home, that he &s;eparated his head from his &s;houlders, crying with a loud voice: <HI>This day, Traitor, thy Life and thy great Di&s;loyalties &s;hall come to an end together.</HI></P>
<P>In the mean time, <HI>Gradamart</HI> was fighting with the other Giant, who perceiving his Co&s;in <HI>Ma&s;caron</HI> in &s;o piteous a condition, began to lo&s;e heart, and recoile bark, &s;tep by &s;tep, that he might e&s;cape being kill'd: but the <HI>Knight of the burning Sword,</HI> finding him in his way, gave him &s;o great a blow on the Shoulder, that he cut off his right Arm in &s;uch manner, as one might &s;ee his Liver, whereon he fell imme|diately dead. The re&s;t of the A&s;&s;ailants were &s;o terrify'd at this, that they betook them&s;elves to their heels flying as fa&s;t as they could towards the Fortre&s;s.

<P>King <HI>Amdais,</HI> who, during the&s;e Di&s;cour&s;es, beheld them attentively, had his Heart wholly mov'd; For he began to think his Grand <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">on <HI>Li&s;vart,</HI> whom he re|&s;embled, and &s;u&s;pected immediately by the Marks, which had been given him, that 'twas undoubtedly he, who had conquer'd the <HI>Defended Mountain,</HI> and fought in his Pre&s;ence with the Dutche&s;s of <HI>Savoy</HI>'s Knight: Wherefore having more De&s;ire to know the Truth, he &s;aid to him: <HI>Knight, I heartily thank you for the Benefit, I have receiv'd by you, and the more, becau&s;e the Enmity, which you &s;ay, you bare me, did not divert you from doing &s;o good an Act.

<ARGUMENT>
<P>How the <HI>Knight of the Burning Sword</HI> and <HI>Gradamart,</HI> &s;ailing on the Sea, arriv'd by Fortune in the I&s;le of the <HI>Vermilion Tower,</HI> where <HI>Gandalfe</HI> was combated, and defeated and <HI>Galeotes</HI> and <HI>Madafima,</HI> the Father and Mother of <HI>Balan,</HI> de|liver'd out of Pri&s;on.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>AFter the <HI>Knight of the burning Sword,</HI> and <HI>Gradamart,</HI> had taken leave of King <HI>Amadis,</HI> and were return'd to Sea, they commanded their Mariners to &s;teer their Cour&s;e to the Place, where they had left their Company: And this they did, hoping to be quickly there, and relate to them, what they knew of King <HI>Amadis</HI> who expected them, as you have been told. But no more finding either the Ship, or any Man, of whom they might enquire, what was become of it, the <HI>Knight of the burning Sword</HI> was ready to dye for di&s;plea&s;ure, tho' <HI>Gradamart</HI> comforted him as much, as po&s;&s;ibly he could, knowing, whence this his Di&s;content proceeded. They re&s;olv'd then, as ha&s;t, to return to King <HI>Amadis,</HI> and take their way together to Great <HI>Britain,</HI> where perhaps they might have News of what they &s;o much de&s;ir'd: <HI>For,</HI> &s;aid <HI>Gradamart, 'twould be difficult for &s;uch Per&s;ons, as the Emperor, and the King of</HI> Sicily, <HI>to be long conceal'd, without being di&s;cover'd.</HI></P>
<P>For this cau&s;e they acquainted the Seamen with their Intention, who, re&s;itting their Ve&s;&s;el began to Sail with a favourable Wind, which la&s;ted but a little while, for there aro&s;e &s;uddainly &s;uch a Tempe&s;t, that they were often in Danger of being Ca&s;t away, and were &s;orc'd to abandon their Sails and Oars to the good Plea&s;ure of Fortune, which drove them four whole days without &s;ight of Land, or of any thing, that might give them the lea&s;t hopes in the World to E&s;cape. But on the fifth mor|ning their Bark came to the &s;hore of an I&s;land, into which they made a De&s;cent, gi|ving thanks to their gods for this Relief, tho' they knew not the Countrey, where they perceiv'd, not far from them, a Ca&s;tle&punc; built of &s;tone, as red as Blood, and pre|&s;ently the <HI>Knight of the Burning Sword</HI> call'd to mind, that <HI>Balan</HI> hear &s;uch an one for his Device: wherefore he &s;aid to <HI>Gradamart:</HI></P>
<P><HI>Never tru&s;t me, dear Friend, if we are not arriv'd in the</HI> I&s;land of the Vermi|lion Tower, <HI>and if this Place is not the Ca&s;tle, where the Father and Mother of</HI> Balan <HI>are detain'd Pri&s;oners, which greatly moves me to go &s;ee</HI> Gandalfe, <HI>and de|&s;ire him for courte&s;y to deliver them, and the Land al&s;o to whom it belongs</HI></P>
<P><HI>The&s;e a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">e words,</HI> an&s;wer'd <HI>Gradamart, I have heard</HI> Gandalfe <HI>&s;o much blam'd, that Vertue has no part in him: Nor will he do any thing but by force.</HI></P>
<P>And as they were thus Di&s;cour&s;ing, they &s;aw come towards them, an E&s;quire, ri|ding on a Nag, who, without &s;aluting them, &s;aid to them: <HI>Knights,</HI> Gandalfe, <HI>King of the</HI> Sagittary I&s;land, <HI>greatly wonders, what has mov'd you to &s;et Foot
<PB N="135" REF="74"> in this Countrey, which is his, without acquainting him, and &s;ends you word by me, that you come willingly to his Pri&s;ons, otherwi&s;e, he will put you to the cruel&s;t Death, he can imagine: however, if perhaps</HI> Balan, <HI>Son of</HI> Galeotes <HI>is one of you, he would have him under&s;tand, that he is very glad of it, not for any Good he de|&s;ires him, but in hopes to take off his Head, and &s;end it with his Fathers and</HI> Ma|balimas, <HI>to that wicked King</HI> Amadis, <HI>with whom he &s;o braggingly threaten'd him. But he thinks, that the per&s;on, I &s;peak of, has no lei&s;ure to return, for fear &s;uch an Happine&s;s &s;hould befall him, &s;eeing 'tis &s;o long, &s;ince he promis'd to come back and fight him.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Knight of the burning Sword</HI> was exceedingly mov'd at the hearing him&s;elf threatned with a Pri&s;on, and angrily an&s;wer'd the E&s;quire: <HI>Friend, return to thy Ma&s;ter, and tell him, that he &s;hews him&s;elf, by thy Me&s;&s;age, a more fooli&s;h and proud King, than we are ra&s;h, for having entred into the Countrey, which he &s;hall &s;hort|ly lo&s;e; and where we know that he has nothing of right. Tell him al&s;o, that the coming of</HI> Balan <HI>will make him as &s;orry, as he brags he &s;hould be glad: And for to give him certain a&s;&s;urance of it, I am</HI> Balan, <HI>who could come no &s;ooner to fight him, not for any fear of him, but for want of Time and Opportunity convenient. And therefore let him perform to me, what he is oblig'd to, and I will likewi&s;e on my part keep my promi&s;e with him, which is to pre&s;ent his Head to King</HI> Amadis, <HI>a Prince more Vertuous and Debonnair, than he is Traitorous and wic|ked.</HI></P>
<P>The E&s;quire, having heard him, began to &s;hake his head and &s;miling, to &s;ay to him in mockery: <HI>In good &s;aith I well know now, that your Brain is weaker, and more di&s;turb'd, than I thought for: Neverthele&s;s, your being a Fool, is no Argument to hinder your being cha&s;tis'd as you de&s;erve. But &s;tay, I am going to fetch one that will teach you henceforth to &s;peak more dutifully, and re&s;pectful, than you have done of the Per&s;on of &s;uch a Prince as King</HI> Gandalfe <HI>my Ma&s;ter.</HI></P>
<P>Then he turn'd his Bridle, and &s;etting Spurs to his Hor&s;e, went back the way he came, leaving <HI>Gradamart</HI> very much di&s;pleas'd, that the <HI>Knight of the burning Sword</HI> had alone granted him &s;o great a Matter: For he knew by Report that <HI>Gandalfe</HI> was one of the cruel&s;t and &s;tronge&s;t Giants in the world, and for this cau&s;e he &s;aid to his Companion: <HI>As GOD help me, &s;ince you concern your &s;elf &s;o much in the Affairs of others, you ought much more to take &s;ome care of your own, and I won|der how you have &s;o lightly undertaken this Combat, without giving me &s;ome part in the Danger or Honour that may come of it: Since I much better re&s;emble</HI> Balan, <HI>both in Stature and Countenance than you do, and &s;hould be pleas'd that</HI> Gandalfe <HI>&s;hould think me &s;o, and that you your &s;elf would a&s;&s;ert it to him. By your doing this I &s;hall know that you are willing to recompence the Love I bear you: otherwi&s;e not.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Ah! my great Friend,</HI> an&s;wer'd the <HI>Knight of the burning Sword, the farther we go, the more (methinks) is our Mutual Love manife&s;ted, wherefore there is
<PB N="136" REF="75"> now no need to make any Proof of it: And as for the care, you &s;ay, I take of o|thers Affairs, indeed they are not others, but our own; &s;eeing you &s;ufficiently know the good Will that</HI> Balan <HI>bears us, which obliges us to defend, what con|cerns him, as it were our own. Yet will I not excu&s;e the wrong, I have done you in not asking your Coun&s;el, before I an&s;wer'd the E&s;quire: But the Indignation, he put me in by his Threats, and the high Words, he gave us, made me thus forget my &s;elf, for which, I be&s;eech you to pardon me.</HI></P>
<P>Whil&s;t, they were debating the&s;e matters, the E&s;quire went to carry the King the An&s;wer of the two Knights, at which he was like to run mad for &s;pite. Then he ha&s;tily d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">manded his Arms, and Arm'd him&s;elf, ordering his Servants to take e&s;pe|cial heed, that <HI>Balan</HI> did not fly: <HI>for,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>I will have him burnt with tho&s;e I keep Pri&s;oners.</HI></P>
<P>And immediately he commanded a great Fire to be kindled without the Ca&s;tle, over again&s;t which he caus'd <HI>Galeotes</HI> and <HI>Mada&s;ima</HI> to be bound. Now they knowing nothing of the Combat, which was to be fought, but thought they &s;hould &s;urely dye, when they perceiv'd the two Knights, that expected <HI>Gandalfe,</HI> who &s;eeing the&s;e poor Captives in &s;uch Mi&s;ery, having their Fle&s;h to<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">n, and all bloody with the Torments they daily &s;uffer'd from the Ro&s;ts and Scourges could not forbear weeping, e&s;pecially for the Moan they made, calling for the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of their Son, who&s;e Arrival in time they never expected.</P>
<P>Then came <HI>Gandal&s;e,</HI> to whom the <HI>Knight of the burning Sword</HI> addre&s;s'd him|&s;elf, &s;aying to him: <HI>King, 'tis ju&s;t that before our fight, thou &s;wear to me, that, if the Victory be on my &s;ide, none of thine &s;hall do me any hurt.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Ah! wretched Creature?</HI> an&s;wer'd he, <HI>do&s;t thou think to fall into this hazard? No, no, I will take care to keep thee from it: and to the end thou may&s;t not doubt of it, I &s;wear to thee by the great god</HI> Iupiter, <HI>that if I can po&s;&s;ibly avoid it, I will not kill thee in this Combat, but will take thee alive, to give thee afterwards at lei&s;ure a thou&s;and Deaths one after another. Therefore from this time look to thy &s;elf.</HI></P>
<P>At this word the <HI>Knight of the burning Sword</HI> advanc'd, and the two Champions entred into &s;o wonderful a Combat, t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">at at the two fir&s;t Blows, had not their Hel|mets been &s;trong and well Steel'd, they had broken each others Heads. But at length, the <HI>Knight of the burning Sword,</HI> being exceeding light and dextrous, avoi|ded the Edge of his Enemies Sword, whom he &s;o endamag'd, that finally the wor&s;t was on his &s;ide: yet did he not &s;hew him&s;elf the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">efore the lea&s;t di&s;heartned, but know|ing, that the longer they la&s;ted, the Knight was &s;till lu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">tier, and him&s;elf more out of breath, thought to &s;eize him about the Body, and endeavour with all his Force to &s;ti|fle him.

Being therefore grap<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">led, the Knight be|hav'd him&s;elf &s;o well, that they were both overthrown, tumbling one upon the other,
<PB N="137" REF="75"> &s;ometimes upper, &s;ometimes under, not having means to offend each other with the&s;e Swords. But to what purpo&s;e is it to de&s;cribe particularly all the&s;e Stratagems, and &s;o many Blows? being finally both tir'd, and out of breath, they got up again, and, as if they had yet receiv'd no Dammage, began afre&s;h to a&s;&s;ault each other with greater violence. In the mean time <HI>Gradamart</HI> approacht <HI>Galeotes</HI> and <HI>Mada&s;ima,</HI> who were bound naked to a Po&s;t, as you have been told, and unty'd them, remon&s;tra|ting to them, that this Combat was undertaken for their Liberty, and that they &s;hould therefore pray to GOD for the Victory of the good Knight: <HI>for be&s;ides,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>that your Affairs would go ill, if he &s;hould mi&s;carry, 'twould be very great Dammage that he &s;hould dye.</HI></P>
<P>They, who had to this time been ignorant of the Occa&s;ion of the Combat, lifted up their Hands to Heaven, and weeping bitterly, made devout Prayers and Ori&s;ous. In the mean time the two Combatants, who us'd their utmo&s;t endeavours to defeat each other, were con&s;train'd again to take breath, and go back. Neverthele&s;s this re&s;t la&s;ted little: for the <HI>Knight of the burning Sword,</HI> &s;eeing his Shield hackt, and his Armor in &s;everal places dy'd with his blood, was &s;o animated, that bo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ing down his h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ad he re-charg'd <HI>Gandalfe,</HI> pre&s;&s;ing him &s;o with his Sword, that his h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="3 letters">t be|gan to fail him, and grow heavy in his Harne&s;s, &s;o that he, who was du&s;t, and li<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="2 letters">|pi&s;h of Nature, lo&s;t as it were the means of lifting up his Arms, either to defend or revenge him&s;elf. At which exceedingly di&s;pited, he turn'd to his Gods, and con|juring and cur&s;ing them at every moment, he lifted up his great Cutla&s;s with both his hands, hoping well, that the blow would be advantageous: but the Knight &s;lipt a&s;ide, and parry'd his Shield before it, into which it entred above a great hands breadth, of which neverthele&s;s, he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ad well reueng d him&s;elf, had not his Sword turn'd in his hand with &s;o much misfortune that it &s;truck &s;o fiercely with the flat in&s;tead of the edge, that it brake into Three pieces.

<P>Then they entred into the Fortre&s;s, where the Servants of <HI>Galeotes,</HI> who had been long kept Pri&s;oners by the Giant, were immediately relea&s;ed.

<P>This Charge was committed to <HI>Macetta,</HI> one of <HI>Mada&s;ima</HI>'s Women, whom the <HI>Knight of the burning Sword</HI> fully in&s;tructed, in what &s;he had to do: <HI>And if you &s;hall not,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>find the King, addre&s;s your &s;elf to the Queen from</HI> Balan, <HI>who, to keep his word &s;ends her this pre&s;ent.

<P>THe Ship, in which the Emperor was accompany'd as you have heard, continu'd at Sea, after the Departure of the <HI>Knight of the burning Sword,</HI> for the Sp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ce of three Weeks, without &s;taying, or their knowing, towards what Countrey it droke: But at the end of that time, one <HI>Monday</HI> early in the Morning, it came to &s;urge along a Coa&s;t near a great Forre&s;t. The Emperor and his Company were very glad to have an Opportunity of going a&s;hore, and refre&s;hing them&s;elves, particularly, for the Nece&s;&s;ity they had of &s;weet Water: For that of their Ve&s;&s;el &s;tunk. Wherefore they caus'd their Hor&s;es to be &s;et a&s;hore, them&s;elves al&s;o landing, and commanding tho&s;e, whom they appointed to look to their Ve&s;&s;el, not to part thence, till they had News from them. Then the Knights arm'd them&s;elves, and conducting their Ladies, well
<PB N="140" REF="77"> accoutred, and maskt, that they might not be known, entring into the thickne&s;s of the Wood. In this Company were the Emperor, the King of <HI>Sicily, Li&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">art, Perion, Olorius,</HI> the Prince <HI>Elinius, Adariel, Suycius,</HI> and <HI>Abies</HI> of <HI>Ireland, Alarin</HI> Brother to the Duke of <HI>Ortilen&s;a,</HI> and the Count of <HI>Ala&s;trum,</HI> who all, de&s;iring to find &s;ome Body, that might tell them what Country they were in, followed a beaten Path, in which they had not Travel'd long, when they &s;aw coming to them a Dam|&s;el, riding on a black Hackney, who &s;tay'd to behold them pa&s;s, and in their pa&s;&s;ing, &s;aluted them, &s;aying to them: <HI>Perhaps, my good Lords, you are going to try your &s;elves again&s;t the Devil that keeps a Kay here-by, for the &s;ake of a Dam&s;el, who accompanies him, and there are already &s;ix Months, that he has perform'd this en|terpri&s;e, in which he has behav'd him&s;elf &s;o valiantly, that his Renown is &s;pread through all this Countrey, &s;o that there is no longer any Knight who dares At|tempt to fight him, he has vanqui&s;ht &s;o many.</HI></P>
<P>When the King of <HI>Sicily</HI> heard her &s;peak, he &s;aid to the Emperor: <HI>My Lord, a&s;&s;ure your &s;elf that we are in</HI> Great Britain, <HI>and the Knight, of whom &s;he talks &s;o much, is he, of whom I have heretofore told you.</HI></P>
<P><HI>'Tis true,</HI> &s;aid the Dam&s;el, <HI>that you are in</HI> Great Britain: <HI>and I advi&s;e you to take another way, if you w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ll not be mole&s;t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">d.</HI></P>
<P>At this Coun&s;el all the Knights fell a laughing, re&s;olving neverthele&s;s to pa&s;s on. Wherefore &s;he recommended them to the keeping of our Lord le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ving them very Ioyful for their Arrival &s;o opportunely in a Countrey, where they hop'd not only to be well receiv'd by King <HI>Amadis;</HI> but al&s;o to have the plea&s;ure of &s;eeing the Iu&s;ts, held by the Knight, Lover of the Dutche&s;s, again&s;t whom <HI>Perion</HI> de&s;iring to try him&s;elf, be&s;ought the Emperor and the re&s;t to let him have the fir&s;t Cour&s;e, which was granted him. And pa&s;&s;ing on, they came to a cro&s;s way, where they were joyn'd by a Lady, mounted on a very hand&s;ome Nag. She was cloth'd in black Silk, and had her Face &s;o cover'd, that there was nothing but her Eyes to be &s;een, &s;he was ac|company'd by ten Knights, compleatly Arm'd and four very fair Dam&s;els. She &s;aluted them courteou&s;ly, and they return'd her &s;alutation, asking her, whither &s;he was going?</P>
<P><HI>My Lords,</HI> an&s;wer'd &s;he, <HI>we are going to &s;ee the Wonders done by a Knight, who keeps a Kay hard by, and who&s;e Renown is &s;uch, that I am come expre&s;ly from my Countrey to &s;ee him.</HI></P>
<P><HI>In truth,</HI> &s;aid the Emperor, <HI>we will then accompany you thither: for &s;ome of ours de&s;ire to try them&s;elves again&s;t him.</HI></P>
<P><HI>In good time,</HI> an&s;wer'd the Lady, <HI>I am very glad of it, we &s;hall &s;ee, whether 'tis true that is &s;aid of him.</HI></P>
<P>As they were di&s;cour&s;ing thus, they went out of the Forre&s;t, and perceiv'd in the Plain, two Rich Tents, &s;et up in a Grove of Elms, again&s;t one of which there were many Lances leaning, and under the &s;hade was a Chair of State, in which was &s;it|ting a very fair Dam&s;el, and near her a Knight compleatly Arm'd, who &s;eeing this

<P><HI>Perion,</HI> who was the fir&s;t to enter into play, took the word before all the re&s;t, and an&s;wer'd her: <HI>Dam&s;el, we are come on no other occa&s;ion, and therefore 'tis not needful to &s;ay any more of it: wherefore return to your Mi&s;tre&s;s, and tell her, that we will keep the Law which is e&s;tabli&s;h'd.</HI></P>
<P><HI>So much the better,</HI> &s;aid &s;he, and, &s;uddenly turning her Hor&s;e, went back.</P>
<P>In the mean time the Knight of the Kay, knowing that <HI>Perion</HI> was making him|&s;elf ready to Iu&s;t, charg'd a great Lance, and covering him&s;elf with his Shield, march'd &s;lowly to meet him: but approaching the Career, they ran &s;o &s;tifly one again&s;t the other, that their Staves flew in &s;hivers, them&s;elves meeting with Shields Bodies and Head, &s;o that they both came to the Ground, and their Hor&s;es under them. Ne|verthele&s;s they got up again, and putting their hands to their Swords, began to A&s;&s;ault each other &s;o outragiou&s;ly, that they well &s;hew'd them&s;elves to be no Pren|tices in that work. For this fir&s;t A&s;&s;ault continued above two hours without their taking breath, or without its being known, who had the better or the wor&s;e: and their Shields were &s;o hack'd, and their Armor &s;o endammaged, that not being able to re|&s;i&s;t any longer the edge of their Swords, the pure blood was &s;een to trickle down from their Bodies to the Gra&s;s.</P>
<P>The Dutche&s;s who piteou&s;ly beheld her Knight, chang'd colour every moment, becau&s;e the longer <HI>Perion</HI> continu'd the more brisk and couragious he appear'd, mak|ing him&s;elf &s;o much dreaded by his Enemy, that he thought he never found any Man, except the <HI>Knight of the burning Sowrd,</HI> that put him &s;o much to it: a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">d for this cau&s;e praying within him&s;elf, he &s;aid: <HI>O GOD, who ha&s;t &s;o long kept my Honour, abandon me not, I be&s;eech thee, to this devil, who will di&s;honour me if he can. A devil certainly he is, though he has the &s;hape of a Man: for if he had been other, he could not have treated me &s;o rudely: wherefore, permit me not, O Lord, in five days, which remain to accompli&s;h my Oath in the keeping this Pa&s;s, to fall into any &s;hame, or danger of my body.</HI></P>
<P>Now <HI>Perion</HI> thought no le&s;s on his &s;ide: Neverthele&s;s he would rather have cho&s;e never to have been di&s;enchanted than to be &s;o unhappily vanqui&s;ht, and that in <HI>Great Britain:</HI> the thoughts of which &s;o enrag'd him, that he redoubled his blows, whereof the Dutche&s;&s;es Knight made little Account: nor could any Ad|vantage be di&s;cern'd more on the one &s;ide than on the other, tho they were hath &s;o dy'd with blood, that their Harne&s;s, before bright, was become red, which very much di&s;plea&s;ed <HI>Li&s;vart,</HI> who thought, 'twould be impo&s;&s;ible, <HI>Perion</HI> &s;hould not h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ve an ill I&s;&s;ue of it.

<PB N="142" REF="78"> with &s;hame, mix'd with Anger, he lift up his Arm, and thinking to &s;trike his Ene|my with all his force on the head, his Sword entred &s;o far into his Adver&s;aries Shield, that it cleft it, the point only reaching to his Forehead, which it wounded in &s;uch manner, that he &s;tagger'd two or three Paces backward. This, when the Dutche&s;s &s;aw, &s;he chang'd Colour, which was perceiv'd by her Knight, who, de&s;ir|ous to recover his Reputation, and rejoyce her, who was almo&s;t dead at the &s;ight of his misfortune, flew at <HI>Perion</HI> giving him &s;uch a blow on the Helmet, that, if it had not been one of the be&s;t in the world, his life had been infallibly gone. But by mi&s;|fortune, his Sword brake, leaving nothing in his hand but the hilt: yet through the great fiercene&s;s of the blow, the Laces of <HI>Perions</HI> Helmet brake, &s;o that his head re|main'd di&s;armed, and he was fain to clap one hand on the Ground to keep him&s;elf from falling. But ri&s;ing nimbly up, he took his Sword in both hands, and was ready to give his Enemy the like, when the Dam&s;el, whom they had met in the way, attended by &s;o fair a Company, alighted from <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="2 letters">r Hor&s;e, and catching hold of <HI>Perion,</HI> &s;topt him, &s;aying: <HI>Ah! ah! my Lo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">d, 'tis enough! for GOD's &s;ake forbear; for he, whom you are going to kill, is your Son</HI> Don Florelus, <HI>and &s;he that holds you is his Mother.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Perion,</HI> much a&s;toni&s;ht at her Words, &s;uddenly knew her to be the Dutche&s;s of <HI>Au&s;tria,</HI> who came to &s;eek him in <HI>Trebi&s;ond,</HI> to defend her Land, which he re-conquer'd for her, as you have been told in the &s;ixth Book of <HI>Amadis</HI> of <HI>Gaul,</HI> whereat he then receiv'd great Ioy. And neverthele&s;s, as if he had been in the Pre&s;ence of his Lady <HI>Gricileria,</HI> he could not forbear to blu&s;h, fearing &s;he would be di&s;contented at it: But finding <HI>Florelus</HI> to be &s;o good a Knight, that there was not known any Diffe|rence between them, he per&s;waded him&s;elf, &s;he would ea&s;ily forgive him this Fault, <HI>Flo|relus</HI> then under&s;tanding, by his Mothers Di&s;cour&s;e, that he was Son of <HI>Perion,</HI> was the joyfulle&s;t man in the world: &s;he had indeed formerly told him of it, but he had never &s;een him, and therefore re&s;olv'd as &s;oon as his Enterpri&s;e was fini&s;ht, to go and &s;eek him where-ever he might be. Wherefore &s;eeing him&s;elf deliver'd from this Travel; and the Offence, he had committed, he threw his Helmet on the Ground, and kneeling down to ki&s;s his Hands, &s;aid to him with Tears in his Eyes: <HI>Alas! My Lord, pardon me this Fault, for which I am certainly very well cha&s;tis'd, tho' I e&s;teem my Wounds as nothing, and le&s;s the Re&s;i&s;tance, I have made again&s;t you: For if there is any Goodne&s;s in me, it proceeds from you, who are my Father.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Perion,</HI> being un&s;peakably glad, took him up, and ki&s;&s;ing, and Embracing him, an&s;wer'd him thus: <HI>In good Faith Son, where there is no Offence, there is no need of Pardon: And moreover 'tis I, that have failed in having thro' Gaye|ty of Heart, fooli&s;hly undertaken that which I might well have let alone: But if I have done it, I heartily repent it, &s;ince by the great Prowe&s;s, which is in you, every one may know, that the wor&s;t of the Combat was on my &s;ide.

<P><HI>My Lord,</HI> &s;aid the Dutche&s;s of <HI>Au&s;tria, never was woman more di&s;contented, than I have been for a time: For he left me, and my Country, without taking leave of me, to go, as <HI>I</HI> have &s;ince under&s;to<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">d, into</HI> Savoy, <HI>whither I was already on my way to Follow him, when News was brought me, that he was in the&s;e parts, where I have found him opportunely, both for you and him.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Madam,</HI> an&s;wer'd <HI>Florelus, I be&s;eech you to pardon me.</HI></P>
<P>And as he would have made his Excu&s;es, the Emperor and the other Knights, having heard and &s;een things, as they pa&s;s'd between the Father, Mother, and Son, were alighted, and intending no longer to conceal them&s;elves, came to them, the Emperor &s;aluting the Dutche&s;s of <HI>Au&s;tria,</HI> and &s;aying do her: <HI>Madam, you have rea&s;on to be contented with your Voyage, for without your &s;o &s;ea&s;onable Arrival, the flower of your friends had this day been in wonderful danger.</HI></P>

<P>The Noi&s;e of this ran immediately through the whole Palace, &s;o that it came to the Ears of <HI>Arban</HI> King of <HI>North-wales, Angriot d' E&s;travaux,</HI> and &s;everal other good Knights, all which came to the Queen, who made them&s;elves partakers of her Plea&s;ure: nor did <HI>Alquifa</HI> forget to tell them, in what a wonderful manner the Em|peror and his Company had been di&s;enchanted by the <HI>Knight of the burning Sword.</HI></P>

<P><HI>Madam,</HI> &s;aid King <HI>Arban, it is then my opinion, that I go (if you plea&s;e) to them to morrow, and intreat them in your Name to come to</HI> London: <HI>for I am &s;ure, the King would be much di&s;plea&s;ed, if the Emperor and the King of</HI> Sicily <HI>&s;hould not be received, as the greatne&s;s of their Quality de&s;erves.</HI></P>
<P><HI>I be&s;eech you do &s;o,</HI> an&s;wer'd the Queen, <HI>and take with you &s;uch per&s;ons from hence, as you &s;hall think good.

Tell my Children al&s;o, that they by no means delay to come and &s;ee me, and bring all the re&s;t with them.</HI></P>
<P>King <HI>Arban</HI> then parted the next day, and with a good Company of Knights and E&s;quires went to the Kay, where he found the Emperor with the re&s;t hearing Ma&s;s, to whom he related the Queens Me&s;&s;age, inviting and reque&s;ting them in the be&s;t manner he could.</P>
<P><HI>Certainly,</HI> &s;aid the Emperor, <HI>we would in no wi&s;e fail &s;o good a Prince&s;s; but I doubt our Sick Men will not be able to remove, they are &s;o exceedingly wounded but let us go &s;ee them, and we &s;hall know their Opinion.</HI></P>
<PB N="146" REF="80">
<P>Then they went into the Pavilion, where <HI>Perion</HI> and <HI>Florelus</HI> were. <HI>Perion,</HI> who pre&s;ently knew King <HI>Arban,</HI> &s;tretching forth his Arms, embrac'd him, and ask'd him, whether the King and Queen were in good Health.</P>
<P><HI>My Lord,</HI> an&s;wered he, <HI>I can give you no account of the King, who is ab&s;ent; but the Queen de&s;ires you and</HI> Li&s;vart <HI>to come and &s;ee her, as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible you can, and to bring with you the&s;e Lords and Ladies.</HI></P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>AFter King <HI>Arban</HI> had left the Emperor and the re&s;t at the Kay, the Dutche&s;s of <HI>Savoy,</HI> knowing that they were all to part for <HI>London</HI> gave Order for the making a Litter to carry <HI>Florelus</HI> and <HI>Perion.</HI> So they pa&s;s'd the Remainder of that day in all plea&s;ure, and the next day every one of them took Hor&s;e, except the two wounded Men, who were carry'd in Mens Arms, that they might not be too much &s;hockt by the way. And behind them came the Dutche&s;s of <HI>Savoy</HI> in a great Chariot, cover'd with Cloth of Gold. At her Neck hung the rich Sword and Shield, and round about her were the Shields of the vanqui&s;ht Knights, and their Names underneath, for a Te&s;timony of <HI>Florelus</HI>'s Victory, and Triumph, which &s;o plea&s;ed <HI>Perion,</HI> that he &s;ent her his, praying her to put it in the rank with the others, or el&s;e he &s;hould be di&s;plea&s;ed.</P>

<P>Then &s;he askt for a Lance, to the Head of which &s;he caus'd the Shield to be fa&s;tned, and rai&s;ed it up to the top of the Chariot, &s;ending her own rich one, with the Sword, to hang at <HI>Perions</HI> Litter, who would not at fir&s;t permit it, and in &s;uch Equipage, they entred into the City of <HI>London,</HI> there going forth to meet them King <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">rban, Angriote d' E&s;travaux,</HI> with &s;everal Dukes&punc; Earls, Barens, Knights and E|&s;quires.

<P>Then came the Queen <HI>Oriana,</HI> clad in black Cloth, for the Ab&s;ence of King <HI>Ama|dis,</HI> and at the Entrance of the Hall, gave them a very great and &s;umptuous Re|ception.

</ARGUMENT>
<P>THis Noble Company being at Table, making the be&s;t Chear they could devi&s;e, except <HI>Balan,</HI> who thought on nothing but going to Fight his Enemy, and deliver his Father and Mother from the cruel Pri&s;on, in which they were detain'd, there entred into the Hall a Dam&s;el, carrying in her hands the Head of a Giant, which &s;he held by the hair. This Woman was &s;oon known by <HI>Balan:</HI> for 'twas <HI>Macetta,</HI> to whom the <HI>Knight of the burning Sword</HI> had delivered King <HI>Gandalf</HI>'s Head, to pre&s;ent it to King <HI>Amadis.

<P><HI>Dam&s;el,</HI> an&s;wered the Emperor, <HI>he is not here at this time, for which we are much troubled.</HI></P>
<P><HI>It may well be,</HI> &s;aid <HI>Macetta, that he is not yet arrived, but his return will not be much longer delayed: and in the mean time I pray you to &s;hew me, which of the&s;e Ladies is Queen</HI> Oriana, <HI>to whom, in the Kings Ab&s;ence, I am commanded to addre&s;s my &s;elf.</HI></P>
<P><HI>My friend,</HI> an&s;wered the Queen, <HI>I am &s;he: would you have any thing with me?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Madam,</HI> an&s;wered the Dam&s;el, <HI>the</HI> Knight of the burning Sword, <HI>the mo&s;t ac|compli&s;ht of all men this day living, &s;ends you this Head of the King of the</HI> Sagit|tary I&s;land, <HI>to acquit</HI> Balan, <HI>&s;on of</HI> Galeotes, <HI>of the promi&s;e, he had made. And to let you under&s;tand how all goes, this Valiant Knight, de&s;irous to amend the Wrong and great Outrage, which this wicked King</HI> Gandalfe <HI>did to</HI> Galeotes <HI>and</HI> Mada&s;ima, <HI>who&s;e Servant I am, had the mo&s;t cruel and wonderful fight with him, that ever was &s;een: but in the end, GOD, the true Ju&s;tice, has given the Victory

<P>This News indeed very much plea&s;ed all that heard it, who more and more prai|&s;ed the Prowe&s;s of the <HI>Knight of the burning Sword,</HI> and among&s;t the re&s;t <HI>Balan,</HI> who in his heart, be&s;ought Almighty GOD, to give him an opportunity &s;ometimes to acknowledge to him the Favour, he had done him.</P>
<P>Then the Queen an&s;wered <HI>Macetta: In good faith, Dam&s;el, the King and I are bound to the good Knight, whom I heartily wi&s;h in this Company: for</HI> Balan <HI>is now delivered from the great pain, and his promi&s;e well performed.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Dam&s;el,</HI> &s;aid the King of <HI>Sicily, can you tell me any thing of a Knight, who car|ried away by force a Dam&s;el, to follow whom the Knight you &s;peak of left our Ve&s;&s;el.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Yes indeed Sir,</HI> an&s;wered &s;he, <HI>that Knight forced neither Lady nor Dam&s;el, but went with her, you mention to fight a Traytor who had killed her Father and Mo|ther. And you may be plea&s;ed to under&s;tand, that it was King</HI> Amadis, <HI>who was never in &s;uch danger, had it not been for the A&s;&s;i&s;tance given him by the</HI> Knight of the Burning Sword <HI>and</HI> Gradamart, <HI>who arrived there very Opportunely.</HI></P>

And the Head of <HI>Gandalfe</HI> was at the Reque&s;t of <HI>Balan</HI> &s;et up over the principal Gate of the Palace, to be &s;een by every one. This done, <HI>Balan,</HI> having taken leave of the Emperor, and the whole A&s;&s;embly, he Em|barkt with <HI>Macetta,</HI> going &s;trait to the I&s;land of the <HI>Vermillion Tower,</HI> not without being both reque&s;ted by <HI>Lucella,</HI> to pre&s;ent an infinity of humble Recommendations to the <HI>Knight of the burning Sword,</HI> and to de&s;ire him, that, to accompli&s;h the Pro|mi&s;e made to the King her Father, he would come to them with all the &s;peed he po&s;|&s;ibly could, a&s;&s;uring him, he &s;hould be well received, and as one, whom &s;he much long|ed to &s;ee. <HI>Macetta</HI> willingly took this, and very well performed it at her Arrival, which was &s;ome days after.

<P><HI>The King in whom the De&s;ire of knowing, what they would have with h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">m, in|creas'd more a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">d more, an&s;wer'd:</HI> My Lords, he parted from me not many dayes &s;ince, and 'twould be difficult for me to tell you at this time, where he is, and more difficult, as I believe for you to find him. But fora&s;much as I greatly love and e|&s;teem him, if you plea&s;e to acquaint me with the Bu&s;ine&s;s, you have with him, I will
<PB N="152" REF="83"> endeavor to tell you farther, what I know of him. And if I can, there is nothing how grievous &s;oever, that I will not in his &s;tead undertake, to do him Plea&s;ure and Service.</P>
<P>On this a&s;&s;urance, <HI>an&s;wer'd the old man,</HI> and al&s;o becau&s;e you &s;eem to me a vali|ant man, I will &s;atisfy you. Under&s;tand, Sir Knight, that this Lady, whom you &s;ee lying here, is Queen of <HI>Saba,</HI> Wife to King <HI>Magadan,</HI> who&s;e near Kin&s;men we are. This King taking Plea&s;ure to make u&s;e of white Per&s;ons, &s;ome of his gave him about ten or twelve years &s;ince a Child, call'd the <HI>Gentleman of the burning Sword,</HI> for the Repre&s;entation of a Sword, which he has naturally printed on his Stomach, red as blood, with certain white Characters, which have not yet been under&s;tood by any one, as we know of. The King did him &s;o much Honor, as to breed him up with his Son <HI>Fulurtin,</HI> and gave them both Order of Knighthood, &s;o that in&s;tead of <HI>Gentleman</HI> he is at this day nam'd the <HI>Knight of the Burning Sword,</HI> We are now &s;eeking him, and to find him, are parted from <HI>Saba</HI> in the Equipage you &s;ee. And to the end you may the better under&s;tand the Affair, this <HI>Knight of the burning Sword</HI> being yet in <HI>Saba</HI> a Gentleman, Son to one of the greate&s;t Princes of <HI>Morona,</HI> acquainted the King, that he, of whom I &s;peak, com|mitted Trea&s;on again&s;t his Maje&s;ty abu&s;ing the Queen <HI>Beruca,</HI> who is here pre|&s;ent, at which the King exceedingly di&s;pleas'd, thought to a&s;certain this unworthy Act, by &s;urprizing them together; but he was deceiv'd: For the <HI>Knight of the Burning Sword</HI> was advertiz'd of it, and ab&s;ented him&s;elf, &s;o that &s;ince we have had no News of him. And, for this cau&s;e the King commanded the Queen to be tak|en, and kept &s;trickly, till &s;uch time as he had recover'd the Adulterer, to burn them in the &s;ame Fire. Neverthele&s;s &s;eeing, that this cruel &s;entance had been already ma|ny dayes delay'd, and that the other was no longer in his Countrey, he re&s;olv'd to put it in Execution again&s;t the Queen.</P>
<P>But &s;he offered to prove her innocence by a Knight, who &s;hould fight <HI>Maudan:</HI> For &s;o was her Accu&s;er nam'd. To which the King would in no wi&s;e have given Ear, had not we, who are his Uncles, and many other princes of his Blood, mov'd with Compa&s;&s;ion, per&s;waded him to grant it: Which being come to <HI>Maudans</HI> knowledge he came with a great Bravado to remon&s;trate, that he would not only de|fend his A&s;&s;ertion, but would bring a Coufin of his, that &s;hould maintain it to the Death, and that they two together would enter the Field again&s;t two others, &s;uch as the Queen could find. And having &s;o &s;aid, he threw down his pledge, but, tho' the Queen has many great kindred, yet none advanc'd to take it up, not for any doubt of her Innocence, but for the great Prowe&s;s, that is &s;aid to be in the two A&s;&s;ailants. Then was Prince <HI>Fulurtin</HI> &s;o &s;orry, that he took up the pledge and Offered him|&s;elf alone to fight in per&s;on for the Ju&s;tification of his Mother. Which they re|fus'd, &s;aying, that they would never put hand to Sword again&s;t the only Son of their Soveraign Lord. Thus was the good Lady, di&s;titute in a manner of all Re|medy,
<PB N="153" REF="83"> imploring with join'd hands the Kings Mercy, with &s;ix months time, to &s;eek &s;ome &s;tranger, that would defend her, &s;ince there was not any one in <HI>Saba</HI> and <HI>Morana,</HI> that offer'd him&s;elf. And tho' <HI>Magadan</HI> at fir&s;t &s;eem'd deaf, yet impor|turn'd by us two, he in fine granted her Reque&s;t, on condition we &s;hould accompa|ny her whither &s;he would have us, and at &s;ix months end on pain of Death bring her back again. Which we &s;olemnly &s;ware to do.</P>
<P>Then we caus'd this Ship to be equipp'd, and from the <HI>Nile</HI> entred into this Sea, where we have been already above the&s;e twelve weeks, enquiring with great Diligence for the <HI>Knight of the burning Sword,</HI> in whom lies all the Queens hopes: Becau&s;e he alone knows better, how this Affair goes, than all other men be|&s;ides. And this good Lady, well knowing his great Courage, makes no doubt, but a&s;&s;oon as he &s;hall have News of it; he will leave all things to defend this Quarrel. Now have you at length under&s;tood the Occa&s;ion of our Voyage: therefore we affe|ctionately de&s;ire you, if you know any Remedy to teach it us: Otherwi&s;e if the gods provide not for it, this good Lady is in very great danger, both of her Honor and Life.</P>
<P><HI>During the Di&s;cour&s;e the Queen &s;o wept and lamented, that the harde&s;t Heart in the world would have been touch'd with Compa&s;&s;ion, and it fell into King</HI> Ama|dis<HI>'s Mind, that &s;he was really innocent: Which made him &s;uddenly think, that he had a very good occa&s;ion to requite the</HI> Knight of the burning Sword <HI>for the A&s;&s;i|&s;tance, he had receiv'd of him in the great</HI> Siclades, <HI>and for this cau&s;e he &s;aid to the old Man.</HI></P>
<P>If the Queen will &s;wear to me on her &s;oul, that &s;he is fal&s;ly accus'd by <HI>Maudan,</HI> I will go with you, and fight him: For perhaps you will not in ten years find him, whom you &s;eek, and in the mean time her Affairs would go very ill.</P>
<P>Ah! ah! Sir Knight <HI>an&s;wer'd the Queen:</HI> I &s;wear to you by the high Name of <HI>Iupiter,</HI> that we never &s;o much as thought of the Di&s;loyalty, with which we are charg'd.</P>
<P>Madam, <HI>&s;aid</HI> Amadis I believe your Word, have therefore good hopes in GOD: For he is ju&s;t, and will do you Ju&s;tice, if you are ju&s;t.</P>
<P><HI>Then were the two old Knights very joyful for having thus &s;hortned their Iour|ney, and &s;o fitly found a Knight, that would fight</HI> Maudan, <HI>and maintain the Queens Right who very affectionatly thanking him, as did al&s;o her two Vncles, be&s;ought him to come into their Ship.</HI></P>
<P>I will do it <HI>an&s;wer'd he</HI> on the Prote&s;tation, you all three make me, that the Ac|cu&s;ers Quarrel is fal&s;e: 'tis al&s;o very requi&s;it, that you have more hopes in your good Right, than in my &s;trength; Otherwi&s;e thinking to pre&s;erve you, Madam, <HI>&s;aid he to the Queen,</HI> I &s;hould ruin you, and my &s;elf al&s;o.</P>
<P>Alas, Sir Knight, <HI>&s;aid &s;he:</HI> I be&s;eech you to believe that knowing the good Will, you have to defend me, if my Cau&s;e were in the lea&s;t dubious, I would not hazard your life for the Pre&s;ervation of mine own, which is already &s;o trouble&s;ome to me, that I e&s;teem it le&s;s than nothing.</P>
<PB N="154" REF="84">
<P>And in this belief <HI>an&s;wer'd</HI> Amadis, I will take the Charge of it: And de&s;ire you not to wonder at what I have remon&s;trated to you, &s;eeing every Knight who enters into the Field of Battle, greatly fails, if he goes not with a&s;&s;urance, that the Right is on his &s;ide.</P>
<P>That I &s;wear to you again, <HI>&s;aid the Queen.</HI></P>
<P>'Tis &s;ufficient <HI>an&s;wer'd</HI> Amadis, let us go when you plea&s;e.</P>
<P><HI>Then he went into the Ship, and di&s;charging his Bark, chang'd his Name, cau&s;|ing him&s;elf to be call'd the</HI> Vermilion Knight, <HI>becau&s;e his Arms were all red, being tho&s;e which</HI> Alquif <HI>&s;ent him, when he embarkt after his Di&s;enchantment, to go to the Siege of</HI> Con&s;tantinople. <HI>Thus tho&s;e of</HI> Saba <HI>return'd back, di&s;cour&s;ing toge|ther of the mo&s;t agreeable Matters, they could, till they entred into the Mouth of the</HI> Nile, <HI>along which they &s;ail'd, and went a&s;hore at</HI> Terrodin; <HI>where the Queen &s;aid to</HI> Amadis,</P>
<P>Good <HI>Vermilion Knight,</HI> we are now in the Country, where <HI>I</HI> hope in our gods, in you, and in the good Right I have, that you will make the wicked, who accu&s;e me, acknowledge their Trea&s;on: For 'tis not above a dayes Journey from hence <HI>to Sa|ba,</HI> where we &s;hall find the Court.</P>
<P>So much the better Madam, <HI>an&s;wer'd he.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Now the Citizens were incontinently advertiz'd of their Prince&s;s Return, and the Aid, &s;he brought with her: Wherefore they went to receive her, and do her Honor: For &s;he was greatly lov'd of them all for her Vertues. And for this Cau&s;e they pre&s;ented her Hor&s;es, and what was nece&s;&s;ary for her going to the King. Before whom, a&s;&s;oon as they were come into</HI> Saba, <HI>his two old Vncles pre&s;ented</HI> Buruca, <HI>and the &s;trange Knight.</HI> Magadan, <HI>&amp; the Lords of his Court wondring at the Queens &s;o &s;udden Return, and yet more at him, who would fight the two Knights, that accus'd her, began to ca&s;t their Eyes on</HI> Maudan, <HI>to &s;ee, what Countenance he kept, when</HI> Buruca <HI>brake forth into this following Di&s;cour&s;e to the King.</HI></P>
<P>Sir, to &s;hew you, that the Traytor, whom <HI>I</HI> &s;ee here pre&s;ent, has unju&s;tly, fal&s;ly, and di&s;loyally accus'd me of Adultery, <HI>I</HI> pre&s;ent you this Knight, who, if i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter"> plea&s;es our gods, will &s;o perform his Du<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">y, that my innocency &s;hall be verify'd, and the wicked Accu&s;er puni&s;ht according to his De&s;ert.</P>
<P>Madam, <HI>an&s;wer'd the King,</HI> if your Knight does &s;o much for you, you will be exceedingly oblig'd to him. Let him come forward then, and declare with his own Mouth, what he has undertaken.</P>
<P>King <HI>Magadan, &s;aid</HI> Amadis then, becau&s;e I have under&s;tood, that the Accu&s;ati|on, which is brought again&s;t this Noble Lady, was invented with the greate&s;t Ma|lice in the world, I am ready to fight the Traytors, to and prove again&s;t them, by force of Arms, that they have fal&s;ly, and maliciou&s;ly accus'd her, and that in all the Evil, they have &s;aid of her, and the <HI>Knight of the burning Sword,</HI> they have ly'd in their Throats.</P>
<P><HI>No &s;ooner had he fini&s;ht this Di&s;cour&s;e, but</HI> Maudan <HI>&s;tept forward, and holding his Co&s;in by the Hand, an&s;wered with great Boldne&s;s:</HI> By my Head, poor Stran|ger,

And becau&s;e thou art &s;o forward, I tell thee, that thou thy &s;elf ly'&s;t, and that you both de&s;erve the Fire, or el&s;e to be drawn by four Hor|&s;es thro' the &s;treet of this Town.</P>
<P>Ah Villain, <HI>an&s;wer'd he in the red Arms,</HI> if thou knowe&s;t as well how to fight, as to rail, thou mu&s;t be a brave Fellow: Neverthele&s;s one thing per&s;wades me, that thou art no &s;uch, &s;ince to &s;econd thee in &s;o wicked an Act, thou tak'&s;t as hone&s;t a man as thy &s;elf. Thus are you both nothing worth, and again&s;t both will I maintain the words, I have &s;poken before the King's Maje&s;ty, and &s;o many Lords here pre|&s;ent; and here is my Pledge to defend it in open Combat, and that pre&s;ently, if it plea&s;e the King.</P>
<P><HI>Then he &s;tretcht forth the fore-part of his Armor; which</HI> Maudan <HI>took hold of, and pull'd &s;o roughly to him, that King</HI> Amadis <HI>was ready to fall, at which he was &s;o di&s;pleas'd, that putting his hand to his Sword, he was about to draw, had not the Con&s;ideration of the Place, where he was, with held him, as al&s;o that King</HI> Magadan <HI>concern'd him&s;elf in it.

<P>How now? Is it fit for you to be &s;o pre&s;umptuous in my Pre&s;ence?

Thus they marcht toge|ther in good Order to the Place, appointed for the Combat, which, when they had rid thrice round with the found of Trumpets and Clarions, they placed him at one end, under a Pavilion, expecting the two A&s;&s;ailants. <HI>Maudan</HI> and <HI>Azaruc,</HI> who in like State entred a little after into the Li&s;ts, without which, a little a&s;ide, there was a

Which was done &s;oon after, for by the Command of <HI>Magadan, Maudan</HI> and <HI>Azaruc</HI> being on the one &s;ide, accompany'd with two Counts their Kin&s;men, who &s;erv'd them for Sureties, and the <HI>Vermilion Knight</HI> on the other, between the two old men, who had brought him thi|ther; a King of Arms made Proclamation aloud, that none &s;hould be &s;o daring, or pre&s;umptuous, for any Good, or Evil, that might befal the Combatants to give them any &s;ign, by any Look, Word, or otherwi&s;e, either to incite, or di&s;courage them: And this on pain of Death. Then he cry'd out with a loud voice three &s;eve|ral times in the&s;e following words: <HI>Let the good Combatants go and do their Duty.</HI></P>
<P>At this Cry the Sureties on both &s;ides retir'd, and the Trumpets began to &s;ound. Then the two Co&s;ins &s;et forward again&s;t the &s;trange Knight, who ran directly a|gain&s;t <HI>Maudan,</HI> who&s;e Death he de&s;ir'd for the in&s;olency, he had &s;hewn at his pre&s;ent|ing him the Pledge of Battle, and met him &s;o fiercely, that breaking his &s;taff even to the handle, a Truncheon &s;tuck in his Shoulder-piece, and pierc't him through with &s;o much Pain, that he fell out of his Saddle to the Ground. Which Queen <HI>Buruca</HI> &s;eeing, was very glad tho' this Ioy la&s;ted her but little: For <HI>Aza<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">uc,</HI> couching his Spear low, wounded <HI>Amadis</HI>'s Hor&s;e in the Shoulder, &s;o that he fell down, and his Ma&s;ter under him, who neverthele&s;s got up again, before <HI>Azaruc</HI> had fini&s;ht his Car|reer, and taking his Sword in h s hand, went towards <HI>Maudan,</HI> who was already on his feet, and, as if he felt no Pain from the wound, he had receiv'd in his Arm, fierce|ly pull'd out the Truncheon, and threw it far from him.</P>

<P>How the Emperor <HI>Arqui&s;il</HI> being in the City of <HI>Mentz,</HI> there arriv'd at the Court <HI>Acayus,</HI> Son to the King of <HI>The&s;&s;aly,</HI> whom <HI>Mana&s;&s;es,</HI> Son to the Duke of <HI>Buillon,</HI> &s;lew thro' his Jealou&s;y of the Infanta <HI>E&s;clariana.</HI></P>

<P><HI>ARqui&s;il,</HI> Emperor of <HI>Rome,</HI> &s;ojourning in his good City of <HI>Mentz,</HI> with the Empre&s;s <HI>Leonorina, Dinerpious,</HI> and his wife <HI>Bri&s;enna,</HI> Daughter of King <HI>Amadis,</HI> thinking on nothing but Fea&s;ting and rejoycing in the be&s;t manner, they could, the Court being then fill'd with Princes, as well Natives, Forreigners, the

And for this cau&s;e he parted from his Country, &amp; with a fair and great Train came to <HI>Mentz:</HI> Where <HI>Arqui&s;il</HI> receiv'd him courteou&s;ly and honorably, as well for the &s;ake of his Father the King of <HI>The&s;&s;aly,</HI> as becau&s;e he was a fair, young, and good-con|dition'd Prince. <HI>Acayus</HI> was greatly pleas'd with it, and much more, when he had &s;een and di&s;cour&s;ed with <HI>E&s;clariana.</HI> Whom he found means to acquaint with the occa&s;ion of his Arrival at Court, promi&s;ing her, if &s;he thought good, to reque&s;t the Emperor's, and the King of <HI>The&s;&s;aly</HI>'s Con&s;ent to the Marriage of him and her. The Infanta, not us'd to &s;uch Di&s;cour&s;es, blu&s;ht at fir&s;t, thanking him neverthele&s;s for the Honor, he did her, and as a di&s;creet, and well advis'd Lady, excus'd her &s;elf from making any further An&s;wer.</P>
<P>Now there hapned to be pre&s;ent, when <HI>Acayus</HI> and <HI>E&s;clariana</HI> were di&s;cour&s;ing to|gether, another young Prince, nam'd <HI>Mana&s;&s;es,</HI> Son to the Duke of <HI>Buillon,</HI> who, pretending to the &s;ame Happine&s;s, <HI>Acayus</HI> did, felt in his Soul a great Di&s;turbance at the good looks, they gave each other, and thence entred into &s;uch a Iealou&s;y, that it produc'd afterwards a great deal of Mi&s;chief, as you &s;hall under&s;tand. This Son to the Duke of <HI>Buillon</HI> was a young, lu&s;ty, and good Knight, as one &s;hall &s;ee, but <HI>E&s;clariana</HI> knowing, that he came from a Race of Traytors, made no Account of him, what Love and Service &s;oever he offered her, or &s;he took notice of: So that &s;he would not, to be Empre&s;s of the whole world, have had him for her Husband. And what incen&s;ed him more was, that he had found Means to under&s;tand part of the Offers which <HI>Acayus</HI> had made the Prince&s;s at which he was &s;o inflam'd, that he re&s;olv'd to be revenged of his Corrival, and by killing him to get wholly rid of him. And what, much contributed thereto: Vnder&s;tand, that the Emperor had, on occa&s;ion of &s;o great a Court, caus'd Li&s;ts to be &s;et up for turneying, and Scaffolds round about: Where|fore <HI>Acayus</HI> put him&s;elf in the be&s;t Equipage, he could, hoping in &s;avour of his Mi&s;|tre&s;s, to Do feats of Arms, and &s;hew him&s;elf &s;uch, as he was. And to the end, &s;he might the better know him, one day among&s;t others he came to the Palace, where the Tables were cover'd for Dinner. Great and &s;umptuous was the Service, during which <HI>Acayus</HI> could not be &s;atisfyed with having his Eye continually on her, whom he loved with all his heart. And tho' &s;he minded it not, as being young, and not in|fected with the like Di&s;temper, yet was <HI>Mana&s;&s;es</HI> &s;trangely unea&s;y, and at every turn gnawed his Nails, till the Tables were taken away, and the Knights and Ladies went into the Court, where they found their Hor&s;es ready to go &amp; &s;ee, who could ride be&s;t that Afternoon. Now <HI>Acayus</HI> &s;tirred not from <HI>E&s;clariana,</HI> but took the Reins of her Hor&s;e, and led her, di&s;cour&s;ing her, as tho&s;e are wont to do, who de&s;ire their Mi&s;tre&s;&s;es Favors. At which <HI>Mana&s;&s;es</HI> grew more enraged, but not being able at that
<PB N="162" REF="88"> time to remedy it, he con&s;idered to prejudice them both to put him&s;elf by their &s;ide, and hear them, or keep them from &s;peaking privatly to one another.

<P><HI>Madam, if you be plea&s;ed &s;o far to favor me, as to give me &s;ome Sleeve, and command me to wear it to morrow at the Furney, methinks, no ill could befal me, and my Forces would on your occa&s;ion be redoubled.</HI></P>

<P><HI>Mana&s;&s;es,</HI> who heard him, could no longer hold, but &s;pake thus to <HI>Acayus: Prince, you might well have forborn making this Di&s;cour&s;e to my Lady: Since if &s;he would &s;o far extend her Liberality, &s;he might do it to another, who can better &s;erve her than you: And to vaunt your &s;elf thus, you &s;hould not have left the King your Fathers Countrey, and come hither, where is the flower of all Chi|valry.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Truly Knight,</HI> an&s;wer'd <HI>Acayus, it may well be, that another &s;hould &s;erve her; but not better than I, or with more occa&s;ion of Right, or Merit.

<P><HI>Acayus,</HI> who&s;e Head and Anger had heated, was &s;o di&s;plea&s;ed, that he thus an&s;|wer'd <HI>Mana&s;&s;es.

<P><HI>Mana&s;&s;es,</HI> tru&s;ting to a Croud of Kindred, he had about him, could di&s;&s;emble no more, but &s;uddenly put his hand to his Sword, charging the Prince of <HI>The&s;&s;aly,</HI> &s;aid to him: <HI>Ra&s;cal, does it belong to you thus ba&s;ely to threaten a better than your &s;elf?</HI></P>
<P>Then he gave him &s;uch a Blow on the Head, as kill'd him, &s;o that he fell dead from his Hor&s;e to the Ground, at which there was a great Commotion: For the Princes Attendants, &s;eeing &s;uch an Outrage ran upon <HI>Mana&s;&s;es;</HI> but he was defended by his, &s;o that many on both &s;ides there ended their Dayes: And yet wor&s;e had it been, had not the Emperor taken order, who putting him&s;elf between the two Parties, com|manded both on their Lives to retire.

<P>At this cry the Prince&s;s <HI>Bri&s;enna</HI> found no better remedy than to take her Daugh|ter, and flying under the Vaults of the Palace, came to a Sally-port on the &s;ide of the River, where they perceived a Fi&s;her-boat, into which they entred: and &s;etting it a drift, the Stream began to carry it down with &s;o much &s;wiftne&s;s, that they came to the Sea before it was day. In the mean time tho&s;e who lay concealed in the Dukes Hou&s;e, and who only waited for the Slaughter, ran forth &s;trait into the Market-place, killing and wounding all they met. There was a pittiful and horrid Specta|cle: for the&s;e wicked Men often &s;pared not the poor Women, who with their Hair about their Ears lamented, one for her Husband, another her Father or her Brother.

<P>AFter the L<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="2 letters"> were faln a&s;leep, he, who had la&s;t beheld <HI>E&s;clariana</HI> with an Vncha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter"> Eye, as we have told you, was &s;o inflam'd with her Love, that he did nothing all Night but Sigh, Mu&s;ing how he might attain to his de&s;ires. And in this thought, hearing his Companions &s;hort, he aro&s;e &s;oftly up, and came to the Door of the Cabin, where the Ladies were which he opened: And becau&s;e they &s;lept &s;oundly, he came very near them, and the more he beheld the Infanta, the more did the Fire, already kindled in his Entrals, increa&s;e, &s;o that he &s;aid within him&s;elf: <HI>Alas! if I do not &s;oon enjoy this Woman, 'tis impo&s;&s;ible that I can live!

<P>Then he began to think with him&s;elf, that he might ea&s;ily carry her away with|out noi&s;e: wherefore he went, and arm'd him&s;elf, and returning &s;peedily into the Ladies Cabin, he took the Fa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">r One gently in his Arms and without ever waking her, &s;o &s;oundly did &s;he &s;leep, carry'd her into a Skiff, fa&s;tned to the Ship, which he &s;uddainly unty'd: and covering <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">is Prey with his Cloak, began to Sail away with|out being perceiv'd by any one.

<P>When <HI>E&s;clariana</HI> heard him &s;peak thus, &s;he was &s;o enraged, that without fearing any thing, &s;he thus an&s;wered him: <HI>Sir Knight, carry me &s;peedily back to the Place, from whence you have taken me, without making me any more of the&s;e Di&s;cour&s;es: for I am not &s;o incon&s;iderable, that you &s;hould be admitted to &s;uch a Familiarity with me. And GOD forbid I &s;hould ever &s;o much &s;tain my Family: certainly I would fir&s;t kill my &s;elf before you with mine own hands.</HI></P>
<P>Very much amaz'd, and &s;orry together, was the Knight, who, hurried on by the Violence of his Pa&s;&s;ion, was about to u&s;e Force, neverthele&s;s he would fir&s;t en|deavour to gain her by words, &s;aying to her: <HI>How? do you think your &s;elf better than me?

<P><HI>E&s;clariana,</HI> who heard the&s;e Threats, &s;aw well, that 'twas in earne&s;t, neverthe|le&s;s without appearing any way daunted, &s;he &s;peedily an&s;wered him: <HI>Do you threa|ten me? have a care what you do: for you would be made to pay dear for &s;uch force, were it only by him who is in Heaven, and who will not, if he plea&s;es &s;uffer it.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Ha, ha,</HI> &s;aid the Knight, &s;miling, <HI>I will now &s;ee whether HE concerns him&s;elf with &s;uch matters.</HI></P>
<P>Then he went about to throw her down, and pro&s;ecute his bea&s;tly Intent: But &s;he taught hold of his Hair, and crying out with a loud voice, begged the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of Almighty GOD, who graciou&s;ly and mercifully heard her: So that at that very In&s;tant there pa&s;&s;ed by a Boat, and one Mariner, carrying a Knight, who, hearing this Voice, immediately commanded his Guide to make towards it with his Boat, that he might &s;ee, what the Matter was.

<P>When &s;he, who was in a manner out of Breath, heard him &s;peak, you may ima|gin how much &s;he was rejoyced, and imploring his Aid, &s;he &s;aid to him: <HI>Alas, my Lord, help me again&s;t this Traytor, who will di&s;honour me.</HI></P>

<P>This &s;aid, they charged one another, and their Combat was at the beginning ve|ry fierce: for the Pirat was nimble and dextrous; yet could he not long re&s;i&s;t the Knight; but was forced, whether he would or no, to give back, and the other entred into the Skiff. Then began the break of Day to appear, and the Infanta perceived, that he, who fought for her Defence, was Tall, Well-proportioned, and Armed in black Armor, without any Device, except in his Shield, where he bare <HI>Or,</HI> an Heart divided <HI>Gules.</HI> And becau&s;e the Victory began to appear vi&s;ibly on his &s;ide, &s;he de|voutly pra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ed our Lord, that he would pre&s;erve him to the end, which happened &s;oon after: For the Knight of the Boat gave the other two &s;uch blows together with his Sword, that he was fain to put his knee to the ground: which being redoubled, Death followed, and he fell into the Sea.</P>

<P>At which &s;he being grieved, as thinking <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">im wounded, &s;he &s;aid to him: <HI>Alas, good Knight, I be&s;eech you bear your &s;elf up: for to &s;ee your Looks, I can have no Joy in my heart: &s;eeing the Obligation I have to you, and what you have done for me. Alas, if you are wounded, &s;hew me where, that I may remedy it in the be&s;t manner I can.</HI></P>
<P>At this gracious word the black Knight found him&s;elf un&s;peakably ea&s;ed, and put|ting both his knees to the ground, an&s;wered her: <HI>Pardon me, Madam, if I have not at fir&s;t &s;hewn you the Re&s;pect I ought: for your excellent Beauty &s;o alienated the &s;ounde&s;t Parts both of my Heart and Spirit, that I found my &s;elf in an in&s;tant free, and immediately a Captive wounded with &s;o mortal a Wo nd, that no other Re|medy can do it good, but your gracious Favour, which I be&s;eech you to grant me, telling me your Name, and what Adventure brought you hither, that I may &s;erve you as you &s;hall command me.</HI></P>
<P>She, who had &s;een him Fight &s;o well, hearing him &s;peak with &s;uch a Grace, and perceiving him to be one of the faire&s;t Knights in the World, wi&s;ht &s;uddainly with|in her &s;elf, that he were of a Family worthy to be her Husband; neverthele&s;s &s;he at that time di&s;&s;embled this Thought, and feigning not to under&s;tand him, made him this An&s;wer: <HI>Indeed, good Knight, I cannot &s;ufficiently thank you for the

<P>And this indeed was the Truth: For the Emperor of <HI>Trebi&s;ond</HI> having Marryed <HI>Griliana</HI> to the Duke of <HI>Breigne,</HI> he grew &s;o di&s;contented, that he went <HI>incognito,</HI> wandring through the World, and had a Combat with <HI>Li&s;va<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">t,</HI> as you may find in the Sixth Book of <HI>Amadis</HI> of <HI>Gaul,</HI> after which he pa&s;s'd into many I&s;lands, fini&s;hing &s;everal Adventures, by which he gained great

<P><HI>I am very glad of it,</HI> &s;aid the Prince&s;s.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t they were thus Di&s;cour&s;ing, a Storm began to ari&s;e, which hourly increa&s;ing, &s;o to&s;&s;ed their little Ve&s;&s;el, which their Mariner was f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">in to leave to the Mercy of the Winds, that they were often in hazard of Drowning, for during the &s;pace of eight days, they knew not which way they went, and yet <HI>Flore&s;tan</HI> was &s;o contented with having his Mi&s;tre&s;s near him, that he minded not the Danger he was in. Being thus Driven by the Tempe&s;t, they were carryed at la&s;t to a very fair I&s;land, well planted with Trees, where they went a&s;hore. Then <HI>Flore&s;tan</HI> took <HI>E&s;clariana</HI> by the Hand, and as he was walking with her to refre&s;h her under the &s;hade, li&s;tning to the Notes of many little Birds there flew over their Heads two great Griffins, who &s;o frightned the Prince&s;s, that without the A&s;&s;urance given her by <HI>Flore&s;tan,</HI> &s;he had dyed. Yet did they not therefore &s;top, but went on to a Clear Fountain, which, i&s;&s;uing from the Rock, made a little Lake, in the mid&s;t of which was placed an high Pillar of Marble, having on it the Effigies of a Lady, car|ved
<PB N="173" REF="93"> in Porphry, with a very fair Crown on her Head, and in the Marble were en|graven certain <HI>Caldean</HI> Letters, which <HI>Flore&s;tan,</HI> though skilled in many Langua|ges, could not read.</P>
<P>The Water of this Fountain appearing very Fair and Clear, <HI>E&s;clariana</HI> had a de&s;ire to drink, but &s;he had &s;carce &s;wallowed the fir&s;t Draught, when &s;he was changed into an horrible Serpent, which, beating its Wings, and &s;haking its Tail, leaped into the Depth of the Lake, leaving <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">lore&s;tan</HI> the mo&s;t amazed Man in the World. But pre&s;ently after ri&s;ing up again, &s;he came upon the Water, where &s;he &s;tayed not long, before &s;he entred into the Hollow of the adjoyning Rock. Wherefore <HI>Flore&s;tan,</HI> in a manner De&s;perate, followed her, &s;aying in him&s;elf: <HI>GOD never help me if I thus for&s;ake my Lady.</HI></P>
<P>Then running after her, he had no &s;ooner &s;et his Foot within the Rock, but met the mo&s;t terrible Mon&s;ter imaginable&punc; for he re&s;embled a Wild Man &s;ave that he was without an Head, and had his eyes in his Stomach, being bigger than the tale&s;t Giant that ever were &s;een. In his Hand he had a great Club with which he &s;truck <HI>Flore&s;tan</HI> &s;uch a blow on the Head, that, being ready to fall, he was forced to put his knee to the ground: Neverthele&s;s he got ea&s;ily up again, and approaching of the Mon&s;ter, gave him &s;uch a blow with his Sword, that he &s;eparated one of his Legs from his Body, &s;o that he fell down to the Ground, giving a great Cry. Then <HI>Flore&s;tan</HI> fell upon him, and made an end of killing him, when he perceived near him a Lady, having on long white Vails, and leaning on a Staff, who &s;aid to him in great Wrath: <HI>In an ill hour, Sir Knight, had you ever &s;o much Power, as &s;o light|ly to kill the Guard of my Cave.</HI></P>
<P>This &s;aid, &s;he &s;tretched out her Arm, and with all her &s;trength &s;truck him on the Helmet, &s;aying, <HI>Well, you &s;hall &s;erve me then, and &s;hall be put in his place.</HI></P>
<P>Scarce had <HI>Flore&s;tan</HI> received the blow of the Staff, but he &s;tood upright, and like a Man deprived of his Sen&s;es, thought on nothing but keeping the Entrance of the Cave. Then the Lady returned whence &s;he came. And in the mean Time the Ma|riner, who &s;tayed in the Boat, &s;eeing that <HI>Flore&s;tan</HI> and <HI>E&s;clariana</HI> did not return, brought his Ve&s;&s;el to an Anchor and went to look for them. Then he &s;ought every where, till he came to the Fountain, where he drank, and was immediately without any knowledge of him&s;elf, only perceiving that two Dam&s;els carryed him away, he knew not whither, till at length he found him&s;elf in an Ob&s;cure Dungeon, Impri|&s;oned with &s;everal others, whom he could not &s;ee for the Darkne&s;s of the Place.

<P>How the Prince&s;s <HI>Bri&s;enna,</HI> when &s;he awaked, not finding her Daughter, was ex|ce<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">dingly di&s;contented, and of what happened, and the manner how &s;he was at la&s;t delivered.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>YOu have heard in what manner the Infant <HI>E&s;clariana</HI> fell into the hands of the Villain, who would have forced her, and how &s;he was carried away, as &s;he was &s;leeping near her Mother, without her, or any others perceiving it. Now the good Lady awaked &s;oon after, the Trouble of her mind not permitting her any long Re&s;t. Then &s;he &s;tretched forth her Arms to perceive how her Daughter did, but not finding her, ro&s;e up, and with a Torch that was burning in the Chamber, loo|ked all about, to &s;ee whether &s;he had not hid her &s;elf, that &s;he might &s;leep more &s;ecure|ly. Then &s;he well knew &s;he was &s;tol<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter"> away: Wherefore going forth on the Deck, &s;he began to cry and roar like a mad Woman &s;o loud, that <HI>Maragnon</HI> (&s;o was the principal Pirat named) heard this Noi&s;e, and wondring at it, askt the Prince&s;s, what &s;he ailed</P>
<P><HI>Alas! Sir.</HI> an&s;wered &s;he, <HI>what have you done with my Daughter! She has been l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">tely taken from me.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Maragnon</HI> was exceedingly &s;urpri&s;ed to hear of this Lo&s;s, and doubted, his Com|panion <HI>Brutus</HI> had pla<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ed him &s;ome <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">rick: And for that he &s;peedily armed him&s;elf, and wit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">out an&s;wering <HI>Bri&s;enna,</HI> took a Torch, and went to <HI>Brutus</HI>'s Cabin, who &s;eeing him com<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter"> in that manner, asked him who di&s;turbed him.</P>
<P><HI>Who?</HI> an&s;wered <HI>Maragnon: You your &s;elf, who have taken away the fair Dam|&s;el, we took Ye&s;terday.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Faith,</HI> &s;aid the other, <HI>it is not &s;o, but you your &s;elf have &s;toln her:</HI> And im|mediately would have her &s;ought for even in the retiring place, hoping to defeat <HI>Ma|ragnon</HI>'s De&s;ign, and recover <HI>E&s;clariana.</HI> But if the one was di&s;turbed, the other was not at re&s;t: Neverthele&s;s they laboured in vain, as you have under&s;tood.</P>
<P>In the mean time the Di<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">olate Mother made pityful Moan, of which <HI>Brutus</HI> taking Comp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;&s;ion, and more di&s;contented to &s;ee him&s;elf fru&s;trated of his Intent, put his hand to his Sword, &s;aying to <HI>Maragnon: By my Faith you have taken away the Dam&s;el, and I will have this for my &s;elf, whether you will or no.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Indeed?</HI> &s;aid the other: <HI>and what &s;hall I have?</HI></P>
<P>Then they drew near each other, and were about to fight. Which their People would not permit, but interpo&s;ing between them, de&s;ired them to have a little pati|ence, till a more diligent &s;earch was made for the lo&s;t Dam&s;el, and if &s;he were not found, that they would ca&s;t Lots who &s;hould have the Lady. This Advice &s;eemed rea&s;onable unto them, and there was no Cabin, great or little, nor any hole or corner in the Ship, left unran&s;ackt: till at la&s;t they perceived that one of their Compani|ons
<PB N="175" REF="94"> was mi&s;&s;ing, and had certainly carry'd her away in the Shiff. This augmented the Tears and Lamentations of the poor Mother, who having before her eyes the damnable Intention of the Picars, that were about to ca&s;t Lots for her, the lo&s;s of her Daughter, whom &s;he certainly thought to have been forc'd both in Body and Ho|nour, and the Remembrance of her Husband, &s;o lately Murthered, was ready to fall into Di&s;pair, and at the point of throwing her &s;elf into the water, rather than &s;uffer|ing any more. Which &s;he had undoubtedly done had not the fear of lo&s;ing her &s;oul withheld her: as al&s;o the coming on of a great Adventure put a &s;top to their De|&s;igns.</P>
<P>Some of the Ship di&s;covered a Ve&s;&s;el, which the Storm had driven into tho&s;e parts: which they no &s;ooner perceived, but there began an Alarm among&s;t them, crying out to go pillage it, and take tho&s;e that were in it Pri&s;oners. Then the Pi|rats put them&s;elves in a readine&s;s to fight, and drew near the Ve&s;&s;el, which they joyn|ed with Hooks and Grapling-Irons. But they entred not into it &s;o ea&s;ily as they thought for: For a Knight, covered with very Rich Arms, who was in it accompa|nyed with fifteen others, pre&s;ented them&s;elves well Armed, and with a very good will, not only to re&s;i&s;t them, but al&s;o to defeat them, if they pa&s;&s;ed any farther. And what gave them yet more occa&s;ion &s;o to do, was, that he, who was &s;o well Armed, pre&s;ently knew the Prince&s;s <HI>Bri&s;enna</HI> making her Lamentation, and calling to GOD for &s;uc|cour: at which he had &s;uch compa&s;&s;ion and di&s;plea&s;ure, that without demurring any longer, he ran upon the Pirats, and &s;upported by his Companions, entred into their Ship: then with his head bow'd down, what hinderance &s;oever they gave him, he took the Prince&s;s by the arm, and led her into his Ve&s;&s;el, whil&s;t his Companions made him way. So he delivered her to the guard of his E&s;quires, and returned &s;peedily to the Battle, where all behaved them&s;elves &s;o valiantly, that there was never &s;een a more cruel Sea-fight, for the few people they were. For he in the Rich Arms and <HI>Maragnon,</HI> joyning each other, &s;ufficiently, &s;hew'd the little Amity there was between them: So that by their well fighting, each of the two Pirats took Courage, and grew bold, they being indeed all &s;tout Knights, e&s;pecially <HI>Brutus.</HI> Neverthele&s;s the Cor&s;aires began at la&s;t to &s;tagger, and retreat into their Ve&s;&s;el: for <HI>Maragnon,</HI> be|ing beaten down, was carryed in by two Servants, thinking to &s;ave his life. Nor could the others any longer re&s;i&s;t him in the rich Armor, when it fortun'd, that there came by a Boat with two Oars, in which there Sai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ed a Knight, arm's with white Armor, the faire&s;t and mo&s;t curiou&s;ly wrought, that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">v<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">r was &s;een. He of whom I &s;peak, went to the place where <HI>Maragnon</HI> lay, and &s;eeing &s;o different a Combat, en|quired &s;ecretly the occa&s;ion.</P>
<P><HI>Sir Knight,</HI> an&s;wered <HI>Maragnon, a Ra&s;cal whom you &s;ee there in rich Armor, has Wickedly A&s;&s;aul ed me to take from me a Lady, whom I love more than my &s;elf: and has her at this pre&s;ent actually in his Ve&s;&s;el.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Is it &s;o?</HI> &s;aid the white Knight: <HI>if I can, I will make him repent it.</HI></P>
<P>Then he commanded his Boat to go near, and taking his Sword in his hand, he
<PB N="176" REF="95"> put him&s;elf among the Combatants, on the Pirates &s;ide, and &s;triking every way, met with one of the others, whom he &s;lew upon the place. Then <HI>Bru|tus,</HI> and his Companions, took heart again; and the others began to give back, till they came near the place where the Prince&s;s was: At which he, in the Rich Armor, being vext, and knowing, that this Misfortune befell them by the Effort of the white Knight, made up to him, and gave him &s;uch a blow on his Helmet, that he was very &s;en&s;ible of the weight of it, and would willingly have revenged him&s;elf; but they were &s;o near to one another, that the white Knight had not room to lift up his Arm: Wherefore he &s;tretched forth his left hand, and caught hold of the &s;traps of his Adver&s;arys Shield, w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ich he pulled to him&s;elf with &s;uch force, that he, in the rich Armor, was brought, whether he would or no, with his no&s;e to the ground.</P>
<P><HI>Now indeed,</HI> &s;aid the other, <HI>will I make you re&s;tore the Ladies which you t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ke away by force.</HI></P>
<P>And taking hold of his Helmet, pluckt it from his Head, and was lifting up his Sword to &s;trike him, when he pre&s;ently knew him: For 'twas <HI>Gan|dalin,</HI> who, as you have been told, went to look for King <HI>Amadis,</HI> in the great <HI>Siclades,</HI> and finding him to be removed, would not return into great <HI>Britain</HI> without him. Therefore he &s;till went about &s;eeking him, till he fell into the hands of him in the white Arms, which was <HI>Amadis,</HI> whom the Storm had dri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">en into that Sea.</P>
<P>That the King was both amazed, and glad at this meeting, you may ea|&s;ily believe: Wherefore he &s;uddainly held his hand, &s;aying to him he had un|der him: <HI>Ah!</HI> Gandalin, <HI>is it po&s;&s;ible, that you are grown a Taker of La|dies by force! VVhat will the Counte&s;s your wife &s;ay, when &s;he knows of it?</HI></P>
<P>At this word <HI>Gandalin</HI> under&s;tood his Ma&s;ter's Voice, and being more joyful, than he had been &s;orrowful, an&s;wered him: <HI>How, Sir, do you call it forcing of Ladies, when I fought to deliver my Lady</HI> Bri&s;enna, <HI>your daugh|ter, from the&s;e Cor&s;airs, who were carrying her away again&s;t her will? By my Head, you have been exceedingly deceived: for you have almo&s;t vanqui&s;ht us all.</HI></P>
<P>The King, &s;eized with Amazement and Fury, could not an&s;wer him: But left <HI>Gandalin,</HI> and turned again&s;t the Pirates, of whom he made &s;uch a &s;laugh|ter, that the mo&s;t part of them were put to the Sword, and the re&s;t fell in|to the Sea. Then the King commanded that all their Speil &s;hould be car|ried into <HI>Gandalins</HI> Ship, and the other &s;et on Fire, which was immediately done. Then <HI>Amadis</HI> went to his Daughter, who, finding her &s;elf delivered from the Danger &s;he had been in, and &s;eeing the King in good health; the Lamentations, &s;he was before making, were converted into prai&s;es of our Lord, and &s;he threw her &s;elf at his feet, having her heart &s;o &s;eized, that &s;he
<PB N="177" REF="95"> could not &s;peak one word to him. But he took her up, asking her, what Fortune had &s;eparated her from the Emperor.</P>
<P><HI>Alas! alas! Sir,</HI> an&s;wered &s;he, <HI>You may well name it Fortune, the &s;trange&s;t and mo&s;t wretched, that ever befell poor de&s;olate woman!

<P>So many other Rea&s;ons did <HI>Amadis</HI> alledge, that &s;he was, in &s;ome mea&s;ure comforted: And the King di&s;arming him&s;elf, turned to <HI>Gan|dalin,</HI> for whom, that he might change the Di&s;cour&s;e, complaining of the great Blow with the Sword, he had received, he &s;aid in &s;port:

<P>YOu have been told in the foregoing Chapters, that the Emperor of <HI>Tre|bi&s;ond,</HI> and the King of <HI>Sicily</HI> promi&s;ed Queen <HI>Oriana</HI> to &s;tay two whole months for King <HI>Amadis:</HI> But at the end of that time, &s;eeing that he did not return, they re&s;olved to depart, to wit the Emperor into <HI>Trebi|&s;ond,</HI> and King <HI>Alpatracy</HI> into <HI>Gaul,</HI> hoping to recover his Kingdom of <HI>Metz:</HI> Wherefore the Queen knowing, that &s;he &s;hould do them wrong to &s;tay them any longer, would no farther importune them, &s;ave that for de&s;ired the King of <HI>Sicily</HI> to leave with her, whil&s;t his War la&s;ted, the Queen and her Daughter, which he liked very well, as did the Ladies al&s;o: For this Reque&s;t came in part from them.

<P>They were no &s;ooner removed, but two young Prince&s;&s;es arrived at <HI>Lon|don,</HI> to be bred up with the Queen: The one Daughter to King <HI>Galaor,</HI> named <HI>Galercia,</HI> and the other to <HI>Dom Bruneo,</HI> called <HI>Altimonea,</HI> both fair in perfection, and who took &s;o great Lode to the Infanta <HI>Lucella,</HI> that they could not be one without the other.

The <HI>Knight of the burning Sword</HI> and <HI>Gradamart,</HI> Sailing in full Sea, &s;ometimes with fair Weather, and very often with Storms, there came upon the <HI>Knight of the burning Sword</HI> a Remembrance of the Fair <HI>Lucella,</HI> which di&s;qui|eted him Night and Day: &s;o that he became wholly Solitary, taking plea&s;ure in nothing, but being alone, and mu&s;ing, &s;aying &s;ometimes to him&s;elf.</P>
<P><HI>Ah! ah! poor Wretch, had it not been better, thou had&s;t, remained for ever Enchanted, and pierced with the Sword, which</HI> Grada&s;ilea <HI>thru&s;t into thy Stomach near the</HI> Chamber of Trea&s;ure? <HI>Alas!

And neverthe|le&s;s your charming look has &s;o intimidated him, that he is become your Slave and Pri&s;oner, no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter"> being able to endeavour the doing, or de&s;iring any thing, but what it plea&s;es you to ask him, which is the Complement of his Unhappine&s;s. Ah, ah, poor Wretch! knowing thy little merit, and her Highne&s;s, the greate&s;t Benefit that can befall thee, is to dye &s;peedily! for 'twere not rea&s;onable that &s;o great a Lady as &s;he is &s;hould aba&s;e her&s;elf to regard the Good or Evil, that is De&s;tined to thee. And moreover, if &s;he &s;hould endeavour to cure thee, 'tis certain, that her Reputation would be le&s;&s;ened: Thus in&s;tead of receiving Service by th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">e or from thee &s;he
<PB N="182" REF="98"> would have Dammage. And &s;ince thou calle&s;t thy &s;elf Servant, the good Ser|vant ought rather to &s;eek the Honour of his Lord, than his own Life, &s;ince in ca&s;e of nece&s;&s;ity he ought to &s;acrifice him&s;elf for him, who&s;e he is, nay to dye more than once, if it were po&s;&s;ible.</HI></P>
<P>Then he fell into a Fit of De&s;pair and Di&s;content, that he was almo&s;t gi|ving up the Gho&s;t: and the more he thought to extingui&s;h, or le&s;&s;en his flame, the more did he re&s;emble him, that throws a little Water on a burning Fur|n ce. Which <HI>Gradamart</HI> perceiving, u&s;ed all po&s;&s;ible Endeavours to divert his Thoughts. Whence it happened one night that as they were di&s;cour&s;ing together, in&s;tead of &s;leeping, they heard the &s;ound of an Harp, joyn'd with the Voice of a Gentleman, which together made a wonderful &s;weet Harmony. They both ro&s;e up, and perceived a Fleet of Ships, in one of which were twelve Flambeaus lighted under a Canopy of Cloth of Gold, where lay a young and hand&s;ome Knight, who Sung and Play'd on that In&s;trument. He, of whom I &s;peak, had his Armor on his back, but his head and hands bare, and at his Beds-head was &s;et a Perron of Alaba&s;ter, very well wrought, and on it the Statue of a Lady, divinely fair, and &s;o exqui&s;itely carv'd, that it wan|ted nothing but Speech. In her right hand &s;he had a Chain of Gold, which in the form of a Co&s;lar went about the Knights Neck, and on her Head a Crown with a Writing, containing the&s;e words: <HI>Onoria <HI>of</HI> Apolonia, <HI>Prin|ce&s;s of Beauty.</HI></HI> In her left hand &s;he had three other little Chains, with which were fa&s;tned by the Neck three Statues of Dam&s;els, crown'd with Royal Cronws, &s;itting at her Feet, and having each of them her Writing, of which the fir&s;t was <HI>Luciana;</HI> the &s;econd <HI>Imperia</HI> Prince&s;s of <HI>Bohemia;</HI> and the third <HI>Alegria</HI> Infanta of <HI>Macedonia.</HI> And a little a&s;ide behind the Per|ron, hung a great Shield, of the brighte&s;t Steel, without any painting, with the Knights Helmet and Sword. At his Feet were al&s;o two other Knights, lying on a Carpet, compleatly armed, except Helmets and Gantlets. <HI>Grada|mart</HI> and the <HI>Knight of the burning Sword,</HI> wondring at that Adventure, cau&s;ed their Ve&s;&s;el to approach that, in which the Torches were.</P>
<P>At that very time the Knight, who had been &s;inging, break forth in the&s;e Words: <HI>Ah,</HI> Lucella, <HI>Prince&s;s of</HI> Sicily, <HI>how great Misfortune is be|faln me, by having heard &s;o great Commendations of you and your Beauty: For, from the day that my heart and mind have had a Te|&s;timony of your perfections, I have neither Re&s;t nor Ea&s;e.</HI> Then he held his Peace, without cea&s;ing to &s;igh.</P>
<P>The <HI>Knight of the Burning Sword,</HI> who felt him&s;elf &s;tung by the&s;e Affe|ctions, became &s;o melancholly and pen&s;ive, that he was even ready to Dye, when he heard him name her, who&s;e pa&s;&s;iona<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">e Servant he was, and &s;aid to <HI>Gradamart: Brother do you perceive the Arrogance of this Fool, who a&s;pires to that, which he is not able &s;o much as to look at?
<PB N="183" REF="98"> Before he gets from me, I will make him change his Opinion, if I can, or it &s;hall co&s;t one of us his Life.</HI></P>
<P><HI>In good faith,</HI> an&s;wered <HI>Gradamart, you will not do wi&s;ely: For neither he nor any other can do you any injury, by loving where he &s;hall think good: Since if he places his Affection on an Object, not de&s;erved nor attainable by him, he prepares for him&s;elf a greater Tor|ment than any one can give him.</HI></P>
<P><HI>'Tis true,</HI> &s;aid the <HI>Knight of the burning Sword, and I certainly know it my &s;elf: And neverthele&s;s 'twould be impo&s;&s;ible for him to &s;uffer &s;o much pain, as &s;he, of whom he &s;peaks, de&s;erves prai&s;e. But be&s;ides, what grea|ter Glory can he pretend to, than the placing his Thoughts &s;o high? If then &s;uch a Thought turn to his Honour and Content, &s;hould I not be a very Novice to &s;uffer in my pre&s;ence the Gra&s;s to be thus cut under my feet, Ah! I &s;hould think my &s;elf unworthy ever to bear the name of Knight: Since al&s;o I vi&s;ibly know, that he carrys this Statue, thus &s;et up, expre&s;ly for Love of her. Therefore I be&s;eech you trouble my Head no farther: for in matters of Love, Coun&s;el is no way approv'd.</HI></P>
<P>As he &s;peak this, the very Fire appeared in his Eyes, and from the &s;ide of his Ve&s;&s;el, he called to the Knight, that held the Harp, &s;aying to him: <HI>You Sir Knight, who can &s;ing otherwi&s;e of Love than you de&s;erve: Come near, good Sir, or I &s;hall go to you, to let you know how di&s;ordered your Head is, &s;ince it belongs not to you, nor any that re&s;embles you, to &s;peak of her whom you prai&s;e, and for whom you thus &s;uffer.</HI></P>
<P>When the other, who was in &s;uch a Mu&s;e upon his Love, that he had not till then perceived him, heard this Threat, he &s;uddenly threw off the Chain, he had about his Neck, and lacing on his Helmet, took his Shield, and went bravely towards the other Ve&s;&s;el, where he &s;aw <HI>Gradamart</HI> and his Compani|on, whom he calmly an&s;wered: <HI>Certainly, Knight, I will not deny either to you, or any other, but that I am guilty of folly, for loving in the place that my heart hath cho&s;en: for all the merits in the World are in my La|dy. And neverthele&s;s my Loyalty being &s;o great, that it exceeds my fol|lys, I have pre&s;umed to venture on &s;o high an Attempt: Yet I am of Opi|nion that neither of them have a greater Share in me, than Pride and pre|&s;umption have in you, who make me &s;o uncourteous a Di&s;cour&s;e, full of Threats and Injuries. And to the end you may another time forbear gi|ving of Coun&s;el to tho&s;e, that ask it not of you, the edge of my Sword &s;hall teach you, that you &s;hould have held your peace, when you began for to &s;peak.</HI></P>
<P>Scarce had he uttered this Word, but he went up on the &s;ide of his Ship, and there began between him and the <HI>Knight of the burning Sword</HI> the tru|ele&s;t Fight, that ever was &s;een. At which <HI>Gradamart</HI> was very much d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;|pleas'd,
<PB N="184" REF="99"> yet exceedingly wondring at both their valours. Which the two Combatants them&s;elves al&s;o thought &s;trange; for the more they proceeded, the more they were to begin, &s;o that tho&s;e, who beheld them, expected nothing but their Death, or at lea&s;t &s;o many wounds on their Bodies, that they would not be quit for a Months keeping their Chamber. Becau&s;e that when the one had given a blow that drew the blood, his Enemy an&s;wered him in the &s;ame manner; &s;o that 'twas difficult to di&s;cern to which of them Fortune pro|mis'd the mo&s;t: and <HI>Gradamart</HI> would have &s;eparated them, could <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">e have &s;ound a means to do it. But at la&s;t, &s;eeing that they were not weary, and that their Combat had continued for the &s;pace of three long hours, he be|thought him&s;elf, that he might keep <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="2 letters">em from wor&s;e to gain them by Pray|ers, &s;aying to them: <HI>Hold, my Lords, hold, for my &s;ake &s;pare your &s;elves: for 'twould be a great Simplicity for you to kill one another on &s;o &s;mall an Occa&s;ion.</HI></P>
<P>This Speech &s;o di&s;pleas'd the <HI>Knight of the burning Sword,</HI> that looking on <HI>Gradamart</HI> with a di&s;contented eye, he thus an&s;wered him: <HI>Ah! Brother do you not wrong me, to e&s;teem that little, which I value more than any thing, that ever befell me? In&s;omuch, that if this Knight does not ac|knowledge his Folly, and &s;wear to me never to love her of whom he vaunts, I know not any man, nay not any god, who&s;e Commands can make me put an End to this Battle.</HI></P>
<P><HI>By my Head, Sir Knight,</HI> &s;aid the other, <HI>you are then very far f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">om what you imagin: &s;ince for this very Rea&s;on, which you alledge I &s;hould &s;ight, altho' I were dead.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Come on then</HI> an&s;wered he <HI>of the burning Sword.</HI></P>
<P>Then they began afre&s;h, and with &s;uch Ob&s;tinacy, that they mind<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">d more <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">o &s;trike than to ward one anothers blows, &s;o that their blood ran down on all &s;ides, without any Advantage bring di&s;cern'd to either of them: But they thought indeed to continue &s;o long, till their &s;trength failing, their life &s;hould end al&s;o.</P>
<P>At which, <HI>Gradamart,</HI> much troubled, and knowing no Remedy for it, call'd the two Knights, who were on the o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">her &s;ide, and &s;aid to them: <HI>My Lords, for GOD's &s;ake, cau&s;e the Torches to be put out&punc; they will at lea&s;t have &s;ome Relaxation.</HI></P>
<P>They, who no le&s;s de&s;ired the breaking of this &s;o cruel Fight, than he who gave them that Coun&s;el, did as he reque&s;ted them; in that the lights being immediately put out, they were all in Darkne&s;s. The two Combatants neverthele&s;s, who were wholly enraged, cea&s;ed not, &s;triking this way and that way at a venture. Which <HI>Gradamart</HI> &s;eeing, reque&s;ted them to part the Ve&s;&s;els, and &s;et Sail.

<P>This put <HI>Gradamart</HI>'s Companion in &s;uch a Fury, that he could &s;carce forbear Outraging him, &s;aying: <HI>In an ill hour, Sir Knight, have you bro|ken my De&s;ign; but you &s;hall repent it.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Gradamart,</HI> knowing the Rage he was in, an&s;wered him not a word, and in the mean time their Ve&s;&s;el &s;till Sailed, getting &s;o far from the other, as, it being very dark, they knew not what became of it. By means whereof part of this Fury pa&s;s'd off by little and little, and they Sailed all night, &s;o that by break of day they came to a certain I&s;land, where they went a &s;hore, to cure the <HI>Knight of the burning Sword,</HI> who was &s;o wounded, that his Life was much doubted. And neverthele&s;s, he had &s;uch a &s;pight again&s;t <HI>Gradamart,</HI> that he vouch&s;aft not &s;o much as to &s;peak to him, or look on him with a good eye, &s;wearing and prote&s;ting, that as &s;oon as he was well enough to bear Arms, he would not &s;tay an hour till he had fought the Ra&s;cal, who had &s;o much offended him, that he would have his life.

<P>Who the Knight was which had that fierce Combat with the <HI>Knight of the Burning Sword,</HI> and the Occa&s;ion why he Sailed in &s;uch an Equipage.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>DOn Brian de Mania&s;te,</HI> King of <HI>Spain,</HI> had two Sons, of which the Elde&s;t was named <HI>Olorius,</HI> a very valiant Knight, of whom our Hi|&s;tory has heretofore made mention. The &s;econd, called <HI>Birmartes,</HI> is he, of whom we now intend to &s;peak, who was &s;o accompli&s;ht both in Beauty of Countenance, P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">rfection of Members, and all other things, requi&s;it to ren|der a Man excellent, that there could hardly be found any one, that exceeded him. This <HI>Birmartes</HI> was Six Years younger than his Brother <HI>Olorius,</HI> when he was Enchanted: And afterwards his Age encrea&s;ing, there encrea|&s;ed in him al&s;o the de&s;ire to follow Arms. To which he was farther moved, by the Report of the great G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">fts, wherewith Nature had endow'd <HI>Lucella,</HI> Daughter to the King of <HI>Sicily,</HI> with whom he fell in Love through Opinion,
<PB N="186" REF="100"> only, without having ever &s;een her: So that he re&s;olved to go to <HI>Alpatracys</HI> Court, and do him &s;o much Service, that he &s;hould willingly give her to him for Wife. And in this Intention, finding one day a fit opportunity, he hum|bly be&s;ought his Father to give him the Order of Knighthood. Which he refu&s;ed him not, but Armed him, and the Solemnity of it was very great through all <HI>Spain.</HI> But the &s;ame day, as they aro&s;e from Table, he put him|&s;elf on his knees before the King, and, with a very Good Grace asked him a Gift. <HI>Don Brian,</HI> who loved him as him&s;elf, was Liberal in promi|&s;ing.</P>
<P><HI>Sir,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>you will permit me then to make a Journey into</HI> Sicily, <HI>to &s;ee the Infan a</HI> Lucella, <HI>who is at this day e&s;teemed the mo&s;t perfectly fair and be&s;t behaved Lady in</HI> Europe: <HI>And if it is &s;o, I will endeavour &s;o to &s;erve the King her Father, that he &s;hall give her to me afterwards for Wife, if I ask her or him.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Don Brian,</HI> glad to &s;ee his Son in this Re&s;olution, commended him, and was content, he &s;hould take &s;uch Knights of his Court as he would choo&s;e, with Money, and Equipage, nece&s;&s;ary for &s;o high an Enterpri&s;e.

But his Labour was in vain, becau&s;e he found there no body but the Governour, whom <HI>Alpatracy</HI> had left, by whom he was acquainted with what was pa&s;|&s;ed. Which wonderfully di&s;plea&s;ed him, and he cur&s;ed his Fortune for ha|ving deprived him of &s;o fair an Occa&s;ion, by which he might have gained what he much doubted to lo&s;e.

<PB N="187" REF="100"> Harbor in <HI>Sicily,</HI> the Sea grew &s;o tempe&s;tuous, that they were, by Fortune, e|ven again&s;t their wills, driven to the Kingdom of <HI>Apolonia,</HI> where they went a&s;hore. And to refre&s;h them&s;elves, being weary of the Sea, they de&s;ign'd to &s;pend a Month in Vi&s;iting the Country. And for this cau&s;e commanding their Marriners not to depart from the Port, all the Knights mounted their Hor&s;es, taking their Way &s;trait to the great City of <HI>Apolonia.</HI> And, as they travell'd, they learnt, how <HI>Branzahar</HI> Duke of <HI>Clarence,</HI> guarded in a Tower <HI>Onoria,</HI> Prince&s;s of <HI>Apolonia,</HI> who was reputed to be one of the fair<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;t Ladies on the Earth. And that you may under&s;tand the manner and Rea&s;on of this Guarding, you will know, that this Duke of <HI>Clarence</HI> was a very powerful Knight, but hard favoured, deform'd, Ill-behav'd, and be&s;ides de|&s;cended of a Giantly Lineage. Now the great Beauty of <HI>Onoria</HI> had been &s;o advantageou&s;ly related to him, that his Heart was &s;mitten with the Re|port: And to &s;ee her, he came to the King her Fathers Court, accompany'd by two Giants his Co&s;ins: But the Ladies Pre&s;ence &s;o depriv'd him of his Liberty, that he thought, he &s;hould dye, if he had her not for Wife. Where|fore with great Earne&s;tne&s;s and Importunity he reque&s;ted her of the King, who knowing him to be &s;uch an one, that is Daughter would never con&s;ent to it, excus'd him&s;elf, by pretending, that &s;he had no Inclination to marry. The Duke, much a&s;toni&s;ht at this News, was ready then to di&s;pair: Ne|verthele&s;s for the la&s;t Remedy he &s;aid to the King, that &s;ince Fortune had been &s;o unkind to him in denying him the thing, he mo&s;t lov'd in this world, he &s;hould never have any Ioy in his Heart; yet in recompence of the Pains, he had taken to come to his Court, he de&s;ired him that he would be plea&s;ed to grant him a Gift. Which the King would not deny him, provided his Daughters Honour were not offended by it.</P>
<P><HI>That certainly Sir,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>it &s;hall not be: For I would &s;ooner con&s;ent to my own Ruin. But &s;ince &s;he will &s;pend her Life without an Husband, and that her Beauty puts tho&s;e who &s;ee her in an unparallel'd Torment, 'tis rea&s;onable for the avoiding &s;o much Mi&s;chief, that &s;he be henceforth &s;hut up in a Tower, where &s;he &s;hall be &s;een by none but you, the Queen, and tho&s;e that &s;hall be ordained to &s;erve her. And I and the&s;e two Giants will keep the three fir&s;t Entrances, &s;o that none &s;hall pa&s;s them, unle&s;s it be by force of Arms. And moreover he mu&s;t, for her Service, accompli&s;h the Conditions, which I &s;hall cau&s;e to be written, and hung upon certain &s;tones, that &s;hall be erected in this Tower: by which, &s;aid he, &s;hall be known the greatne&s;s of your Daughters Beauty, and how much I &s;uffer, and will &s;uffer for her &s;ake.</HI></P>
<P>Then was the King di&s;plea&s;ed at his having &s;o lightly promi&s;ed, what he could not with his Honour revoke, and would gladly have found an Excu&s;e,
<PB N="188" REF="101"> that might have contented the Prince of <HI>Clarence,</HI> but the &s;tone being thrown, and out of his hand, could not be recalled: wherefore he re&s;olved to bow down his Head, and permit his Daughter to be &s;hut up, as he had been de&s;ired. And to do this <HI>B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">anzahar</HI> &s;ent for VVork-men from all parts, who in a few days built in the Tower a &s;quare Chamber, to &s;erve as a Pri&s;on for the Prince&s;s; I may call it a Pri&s;on, becau&s;e it was Scituated in the mid&s;t of a great Hall, and inclo&s;ed round about with great Bars of Gold, through which, and no o|therways, might be given her &s;uch things as &s;he &s;hould have need of. True it is, that, for the little Room that this Square contained, 'twas not po&s;&s;i|ble to &s;ee any thing Fairer or Richer: For the Cielling and Floor were cove|red with great Pla<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">es of Gold and Silver, curiou&s;ly Damaskt, and the VValls were covered with Hangings of Gold and Silk. Divinely wrought for the excellence of the Manufacture. In the mid&s;t there was a Bed, of which the Canopy, Curtains, Coverings, and Ba&s;es, were of Crim&s;on Satin, Richly Embroidered, and &s;et with Pearls, Rubies, Diamonds, and Eme|raulds: And be&s;ide it, hung all &s;orts of Mu&s;ical In&s;trumenes, on which <HI>O|noria</HI> could play. This Pri&s;on then being fini&s;ht as you have under&s;tood, <HI>Branzahar</HI> appointed to be &s;et before it a Pillar of Allaba&s;ter, and on the top of it the Effigies of the Prince&s;s cut to the Life, with a writing round about her Head in the form of a Ducal Cap, which contained the&s;e words: <HI>Onoria, <HI>Lady of beauty.</HI></HI></P>
<P>This done, he took the Infanta, and &s;hut her up under a &s;trong padlock, of which him&s;elf kept the key, and leaving her Dam&s;els without, he &s;aid: <HI>Here &s;hall you be inclo&s;ed, to Recompence the Cruel Pri&s;on of Love, in which you keep me Captive, and &s;hall not come forth till &s;uch time as he comes, who, ea&s;ing me of this pain, &s;hall him&s;elf receive a greater, in &s;eeing your over great and dangerous Beauty.</HI></P>
<P>Then he fa&s;tned a Writing to the pillar, the contents of which were the&s;e: <HI>Thou Knight, who by thy Prowe&s;s art come to this place, where thou may&s;t &s;ee the Faire&s;t Prince&s;s of the world, be not &s;o hardy as to take her forth, before thou ha&s;t carryed this Image, which repre&s;ents her Per&s;on, through the whole Earth, and maintained by Force of Arms, that &s;he, for whom it was made, is the fir&s;t in great Beauty. And if thy Fortune is &s;o pro&s;perous that Victory always accompanys thee, yet art thou bound to br<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">ng hither the Images of the Ladies, Mi&s;tre&s;&s;es of the Knights, vanqui&s;ht by thee, with their Names written underneath. Then, and no &s;ooner, &s;halt thou be per|mitted to take the Fair One out of Pri&s;on. But in ca&s;e thou &s;halt find a bet|ter than thy &s;elf, by whom thou &s;halt be conquered, if thou &s;halt bring the Permi&s;&s;ion of &s;uch thy Conqueror, &s;igned and &s;ealed, with his Mi&s;tre&s;&s;es Name and Seal, then may &s;he go forth in Liberty at her Plea|&s;ure:
<PB N="189" REF="101"> For &s;uch is the Covenant between the King of this Countrey and me.</HI></P>
<P>Having fa&s;tned this Writing, he caus'd another Pillar to be &s;et up be|fore the fir&s;t and principal Gate of the Tower, with a Roll containing what follows. <HI>Let none henceforward adventure to pa&s;s any far<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">her, unle&s;s it be by force of Arms: Becau&s;e the Countenance of</HI> Onoria, <HI>Lady of Beauty, &s;hall no more be manife&s;ted, till he &s;hall come, who &s;hall wholly deliver her. For</HI> Branza<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ar, <HI>Prince of</HI> Clarence, <HI>will defend this Pa&s;&s;age even to Death.</HI></P>
<P>And pre&s;ently he appointed one of his Giants for the Guard of this gate, and another for the &s;econd, and him&s;elf for the third: And they three, Arm'd with very rich Armor, undertook to fight all Comers. At which the King exceedingly wondred, that &s;uch and &s;o great a Lord as <HI>Branzahar,</HI> would put him&s;elf in &s;uch &s;ubjection, and danger of his Per&s;on. Now he was a good Knight, and they whom he had cho&s;en, &s;trong and hardy, which made the &s;peedy Deliverance of <HI>Oriana</HI> little expected: But the King and Queen might &s;ee her when they thought good, and this little &s;he took as a great com|fort in her Fortune. Of which <HI>Birmartes</HI> advertiz'd, immediatly thought, according to the Renown of <HI>Branzahar,</HI> that &s;he, for whom he undertook &s;o great a Charge, mu&s;t needs be very fair: Wherefore he askt &s;ome of the Countrey, whether this Adventure had not yet been try'd by any one. He was an&s;wer'd, that above an Hundred Knights, as well of the Court, as Strangers, had done their Endeavours, but they had all been vanqui&s;ht by the Giant of the fir&s;t Gate: So that 'twas now &s;ix Months &s;ince any one had dar'd to pre&s;ent him&s;elf before him. Now the more that was &s;aid of it to <HI>Birmartes</HI> the more did his De&s;ire of going to &s;ee this Fair One encrea&s;e: &s;o that he re&s;olved, what ever might happen, to try his Fortune for the &s;et|ting her at Liberty. But he knew not what was contain'd in the writing, fa&s;tned to the Pillar of the Image, as you have been told: For it was indeed unknown to all. By occa&s;ion of which many good Knights put their Lives in hazard, hoping to gain Honour, and the love of <HI>Onoria.</HI> So <HI>Birmartes,</HI> and his two Companions <HI>E&s;quinel</HI> and <HI>Meander,</HI> travell'd till they came to the City of <HI>Apolonia,</HI> where he de&s;ired they would &s;hew him <HI>Onorias</HI> Tower. Which a Knight of the Countrey willingly did.</P>
<P>Then a g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">eat Number following him, &s;ome ran to acquaint the King, that a Stranger woul<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter"> fight the Giant of the fir&s;t Gate: <HI>And believe it, Sir,</HI> &s;aid they, <HI>'twould be impo&s;&s;ible to find a more Fair, Young, and Dex|trous K<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ight than he is.</HI></P>
<P>The King, v<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ry glad of this News, &s;uddenly took Hor&s;e, and went to &s;ee <HI>Birmartes,</HI> who had ju&s;t made an end of reading the writing on the fir&s;t Per|ron. Then they &s;aluted one another, and the King, bowing him&s;elf, &s;aid
<PB N="190" REF="102"> to him: <HI>Good, Knight, if Fortune will &s;o favour you, that you can pull down the Pride of the Duke, and deliver my Daughter, a&s;&s;ure your &s;elf, I will greatly recompence you.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Birmartes,</HI> &s;eeing the good Reception the King gave him, thus an&s;wered him: <HI>Sir, he, in who&s;e hands all things are, knows the de&s;ire I have to &s;erve you, and &s;uch as you: e&s;pecially in &s;uch Acts, in which, be&s;ides the Honor that may be gain'd, con&s;i&s;ts the liberty of &s;uch a Prince&s;s as my Lady your Daughter: Not that I will pre&s;ume to promi&s;e my &s;elf the putting an end to that, to which &s;o many good Knights could not attain: but at lea&s;t I will do my Endeavour, being a&s;&s;ured, that, &s;o doing, Death or Life can|not but be honourable to me, imitating the Gallant Men, who have tryed it before me, and in compari&s;on of whom I am nothing.</HI></P>
<P>Then he prepared him&s;elf to begin the Fight, becau&s;e the fir&s;t Giant &s;tood ready to receive him. They delay'd not therefore long to run one again&s;t the other, neither of them mi&s;&s;ing his Blow: For the Gyant &s;truck him with &s;uch force on the Shield that he pierc'd it, and his Spear, pa&s;|&s;ing under his Arm, appeared above a yard on the other &s;ide. But <HI>Birmar|tes,</HI> who ran in a more even line, aiming lower, &s;truck him between the Saddle-bow and the Stomach, &s;o that, the Plates of the Gyant's Armor, not being &s;trong enough to re&s;i&s;t the Fiercene&s;s of the blow, the Lance en|tred into his Guts, and he fell dead to the Ground, without &s;tirring either foot or hand. Of which all the Spectators were very glad, dou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ting never|thele&s;s, that <HI>Birmartes</HI> was cruelly w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">unded. But this Opinion la&s;ted not long: for he, withdrawing his Lance, march'd towards the &s;econd Gate, where he found the other Guard, exceedingly troubled for his Co&s;ins death, to revenge whom, he coutch'd his Spear, and &s;etting &s;purs to his Hor&s;e, mi&s;t his blow. But &s;o did not <HI>Birmartes,</HI> who met him &s;o roughly, that his Lance flew into &s;hivers, and with the &s;hock, their Hor&s;es gave each other, they both fell, and their Ma&s;ters under them. Neverthele&s;s <HI>Birmartes</HI> got &s;peedily up again on his feet, and taking his Sword in his hand, perceived the other, who lamented exceedingly for the extream pain he felt, having his left Leg bruis'd in three or four places, and his Steed &s;o lying on him, that he was not able to &s;tir.</P>
<P>Wherefore <HI>Birmartes</HI> coming to him, &s;aid: <HI>Giant, thou art dead, if thou do&s;t not yield thy &s;elf vanqui&s;ht, and permit me, without any fur|ther hindrance, the Entrance of this Gate, as I &s;hall think good.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Ah,</HI> an&s;wered he, <HI>that you may well do, and I yield my &s;elf wholly to your Di&s;cretion.</HI></P>
<P>Then <HI>Birmartes</HI> pa&s;s'd on, and perceiv'd <HI>Branzahar,</HI> mounted on a great black Hor&s;e, who came to meet him. Now he was hard-favor'd, and ill-&s;hapt,

<P><HI>Knight, thou ha&s;t already gain'd &s;o much Honour, that the Glory of it will remain with thee for ever: and tho' it has been again&s;t my Will, and my Heart cannot be contented with the Lo&s;s of my Friends, whom I &s;o much lov'd, and whom thou ha&s;t &s;lain, but I am call'd to revenge them: Neverthele&s;s con&s;idering, that this Misfortune is befaln them through thy only Prowe&s;s, as thou wa&s;t doing what thou ought&s;t to do for the obtain|ing Renown among&s;t valiant men, I cannot forbear u&s;ing to thee the Cour|te&s;y, that Rea&s;on commands me, &s;eeing thee weary, without Spear and without Hor&s;e: &s;o that if I &s;hould have the better of thee, equipp'd and mounted as I am, &s;uch a Victory would rather turn to my Di&s;grace than Glory: wherefore I choo&s;e rather to alight, and being equal in Arms, to let Fortune play her part, &s;tretching forth her hand to which of us two &s;he plea&s;es</HI></P>
<P>Saying this, he &s;et foot to ground, and embracing his great and &s;trong Shield, with his naked &s;word in his hand, march'd towards <HI>Birmartes,</HI> who having heard him &s;peak &s;o graciou&s;ly, an&s;wer'd him in this manner: <HI>My Lord Prince, your Courte&s;y has more amaz'd me, than the greatne&s;s of your Body, and the &s;trength and largene&s;s of your Limbs: for the Magnani|mity of Hearts con&s;i&s;ts not in the Ma&s;s of Fle&s;h, but in Genero&s;ity and Ver|tue of the Per&s;on, who loves Honour, and de&s;ires to perpetuate his Memo|ry, not by boa&s;ting and Arrogance, but by doing his Duty with few and gentle Words, and Vigorous Execution: &s;o that having already found in you one of the&s;e two points, which is Courte&s;y, I make no doubt but the &s;econd is not far from it: &s;eeing they are &s;eldom, or never a&s;under, no more than Fire is from Heat, and Heat from Fire.

<P>At this word they would no longer &s;pend the time in Di&s;cour&s;es, but charg'd each other with &s;uch fiercene&s;s, that all the Beholders &s;tood amaz'd. One great Advantage <HI>Birmartes</HI> had over the other: He was &s;o nimble, dextrous, and active, that of ten blows, which <HI>Branzahar</HI> &s;truck, not one

<P><HI>Branzahar,</HI> &s;eeing him&s;elf in this Extremity, had his heart much oppre&s;|&s;ed; but not knowing how to remedy it, he thus an&s;wered <HI>Birmartes: I now well know, that 'tis a great Folly to attempt the breaking and forcing what Fortune has ordained, who has hitherto been &s;o contrary to me, that by making me love her, who is fairer than beauty it &s;elf, I am reduced to the &s;hame, in which every one may &s;ee me: therefore, Knight, do with me what thou plea&s;e&s;t, &s;ince 'tis in thy power, if thou think&s;t good, to give me my death, which con&s;idering the Misfortune of my life, I de&s;ire more than thou imagine&s;t. Go then at thy ea&s;e to &s;ee her, who&s;e look alone has &s;uch Power, that the force, thou ha&s;t had again&s;t me and mine, will not perhaps be able to pre&s;erve thee from dying at the &s;ight of her.

<P>When <HI>Birmartes</HI> heard him &s;peak thus, he had &s;o great Compa&s;&s;ion of him, that he humbly be&s;ought the King to cau&s;e him to be lookt after by his Chy|rurgeons But <HI>Branzahar</HI> refu&s;ing it, commanded his Servants to pro|vide a Litter for him, and the other wounded Gyant: and without any far|ther &s;tay took his way to <HI>Clarence,</HI> where he led afterwards the mo&s;t melan|cholly life in the world, having always before the eyes of his mind <HI>Onorias</HI> Beauty, and the &s;hame he had received by loving her too much.</P>

<P><HI>BRanzahar,</HI> Prince of <HI>Clarence,</HI> being carry'd out of the Field, and <HI>Bir|martes</HI> remaining gloriou&s;ly Victorious, the King came to embrace him, &s;aying to him: <HI>Ah! fortunate Knight, and more couragious than can be expre&s;s'd, let us go, if you plea&s;e, to my Daughter, whom I hope, thro' your Prowe&s;s, &s;hortly to &s;ee at liberty, and my &s;elf quit of the promi&s;e I made the Prince, who kept her &s;o clo&s;ely impri&s;on'd to my great Re|gret.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Let us go, Sir,</HI> an&s;wered <HI>Birmartes.</HI></P>
<P>Then, accompany'd by many gallant Knights, they went into the Hall, where <HI>Onorias</HI> Pri&s;on was, as you have heard. Now the Heat of the day was &s;o exce&s;&s;ive, that <HI>Birmartes</HI> took off his Helmet, and delivered it to one
<PB N="194" REF="104"> of his Attendants, having an unu&s;ual colour in his face, when the King pre&s;ented him to his fair Daughter: who, having already under&s;tood by her Dam&s;els the I&s;&s;ue of his fight with <HI>Branzahar,</HI> whom &s;he mortally hated was the Ioyfulle&s;t Woman in the world. And this plea&s;ure render'd her Countenance &s;o gay, that join'd with the Excellence of her Beauty, it made her come very near <HI>Lucellas</HI> Perfection, this her Cheerfulne&s;s having given her a Grace more Divine than Humane.</P>
<P>Then the King &s;aid to his Daughter: <HI>Child, look on this Knight, who has for your &s;ake done this day incredible Feats of Arms, and will, I believe, &s;oon give you the opportunity of going forth from this Place: wherefore 'tis my Opinion, and Reque&s;t that you treat him with Re&s;pect.</HI></P>

<P>Saying this, &s;he &s;tretcht forth her Arm thro' the Grate, to lift him up: for he was on his Knees, as &s;urpriz'd with her Love, and that with &s;uch ve|hemence that, forgetting the Affection he had to that time born to her, for whom he had Travers'd &s;o many Seas, the word <HI>Branzahar</HI> had &s;aid to him, was found true in him, which he remembred very well: and therefore took her gently by the hand, and ki&s;&s;ing it, &s;aid: <HI>Madam, the Prince did as he ought, in keeping you from being &s;een, &s;ince your gracious look is ca|pable to kill men without Remedy.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Onoria</HI> blu&s;ht a little at this prai&s;e, but not for any Di&s;plea&s;ure, &s;he had at it: for <HI>Birmartes</HI> &s;eem'd to her &s;o accompli&s;ht a Knight, that &s;he was ex|ceedingly taken with him.

<P>Neverthele&s;s <HI>Birmartes</HI> would fir&s;t take leave of <HI>Onoria,</HI> who had heard all he &s;aid of her, &amp; the Promi&s;e he made to defend her Beauty throughout the World. Which caus'd in her &s;uch a Regard for him, that beholding him with her gracious Eye, &s;he humbly entreated him, that he would, after he was Cur'd, come again to her before his Departure. This reque&s;t he wil|lingly granted, and bowing very low, went his way, leaving her no le&s;s de|&s;irous of him, than he was ready to &s;erve her all his life. For Love at that in&s;tant &s;eiz'd of their Hearts, mutually transferring them by his Divine Power into each others body, without their having any Perception, or Sen|tinent of it, but by the heat of the la&s;ting fire, which he then kindled in them. Thus <HI>Birmartes</HI> followed the King, who, as they went along, askt him his Name and Quallity, but he be&s;ought him to excu&s;e him for the pre|&s;ent, telling him that he &s;hould at another time under&s;tand it all: VVhere|fore the King, &s;eeing him de&s;irous to conceal him&s;elf, would no farther im|portune him. Di&s;cour&s;ing then of other matters, they came to the Palace, where <HI>Birmartes</HI> was very kindly welcomed by the Queen and the Ladies, who conducted him into a richly furni&s;ht Chamber, and to do him the grea|ter Honour, di&s;arm'd him with their own Hands, and put him to Bed. Then came Chyrurgions to vi&s;it his wounds, of which they promis'd him a &s;peedy Cure, de&s;iring every one to retire and let him &s;leep.

<ARGUMENT>
<P>How <HI>Birmartes,</HI> being cur'd, departed from the King of <HI>Appollonia,</HI> and <HI>Onoria,</HI> to begin his Enterpri&s;e, and the &s;ucce&s;s of it.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE De&s;ire <HI>Birmartes</HI> had to accompli&s;h his Promi&s;e, made to maintain <HI>Onorias</HI> Beauty in all places, very much forwarded the Cure of his wounds, which being perfected, he caus'd his Ships to be put in &s;uch Equi|page, as the <HI>Knight of the burning &s;word</HI> found them in, when they fought.</P>
<P>Then the day of his Embarking being come, he addre&s;s'd him&s;elf to the King, and &s;aid to him: <HI>Sir, fora&s;much as I re&s;olve to &s;et forth pre&s;ently to Sea, I humbly de&s;ire of you, that I may &s;ee my Lady your Daughter be|fore my Departure, to the end &s;he may in your pre&s;ence, and with your leave grant me a gift, that I will ask of her.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Well then,</HI> an&s;wered the King, <HI>let us go thither.</HI></P>
<P>So the King brought him to the Tower, whither being come, after Salu|tations on both &s;ides, <HI>Birmartes</HI> &s;et knee to the ground, and addre&s;&s;ing him|felf to <HI>Onoria,</HI> &s;aid to her: <HI>Madam, I am, according to your command, come to take leave of you, for to accompli&s;h what I have wilingly oblig'd my &s;elf to, hoping (with Ju&s;t Rea&s;on) not to fall into any danger that can hurt me, being accompany'd by your good wi&s;hes, with which I be&s;eech you to favour me, as al&s;o with the Honour of &s;tiling my &s;elf henceforth your Knight <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">n all Places.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Onoria,</HI> very glad to &s;ee that pre&s;ented to her, which &s;he with all her heart de&s;ir'd, made him this An&s;wer: <HI>In good deed I find my &s;elf very hap|py, that &s;uch a Knight, as you are, vouch&s;afes to name him&s;elf mine, and I &s;hould be too indi&s;creetly nice &s;hould I refu&s;e this Offer, which I accept, and reque&s;t it of you, as much as po&s;&s;ibly I can, tru&s;ting &s;o far in your Valour, that my Beauty (which is little in re&s;pect of &s;o many other excellent Ladies) will gain repute thro' the world, your Courage &s;upplying in it, what Nature has omitted: But one thing more I will de&s;ire of you, which is, that you tell me your Name, to the end I may henceforth better know him, who is mine.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Madam,</HI> an&s;wer'd he, <HI>I will never di&s;obey you, be plea&s;ed then to un|der&s;tand, that I am nam'd</HI> Birmartes <HI>the Amorous, and that with good Rea&s;on: For only Love, and &s;he, who&s;e I am, have Power over me.</HI></P>
<PB N="197" REF="105">
<P>This &s;urname did <HI>Birmartes</HI> give him&s;elf, which he never afterwards lo&s;t. <HI>Onoria</HI> very well under&s;tood the End, at which he aim'd, as did al&s;o the King, who did not at all di&s;like it, but immediatly re&s;olv'd, that at his re|turn, if he were found worthy of her, he would give him his Daughter in Marriage, who (had it not be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">n for the Kings Pre&s;ence) would not have &s;tuck in &s;o fair a way, having matter enough for a longer Entertainment with her Friend: But &s;he dur&s;t not &s;ay any more, nor he neither, who had her Adieu, leaving her in &s;trange Pain, thro' the Fire kindled in her heart by Love, who before <HI>Birmartes</HI>'s Arrival had not the lea&s;t Power over her. But he then &s;hew'd him&s;elf victorious, &s;o that to manife&s;t the Beginning of his Trophy, he fill'd her Eyes with Tears, and her heart with &s;ighs and &s;or|rows. Thus it is, that this Beautiful Boy treats tho&s;e, that obey him, who are very often reduc'd to &s;uch Blindne&s;s, that nothing plea&s;es them, but what is mo&s;t hurtful for them. <HI>Birmartes</HI> then, being gone forth from the Pre&s;ence, come to the Piller, and took her Image, &s;aying &s;o loud, that every one might h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ar him. <HI>Certainly, Portraiture, 'tis my Intention to bring you back to this Place, &s;o well accompany'd, that every one &s;hall know your Glory.</HI></P>
<P>Then he went out of the Hall, and with the Kings good Leave, having arm'd him&s;elf, went aboard his Ship, and placing the Effigies, he brought with him upon a rich Pillar, he &s;et &s;ail &s;trait for <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> where he went a&s;hore, and there in the Pre&s;ence of the Princes and Lords re|lated the Occa&s;ion of his Voyage. Wherefore a Son of the King of <HI>Hun|garies,</HI> loving above all others <HI>Luciana</HI> the Emperors Daughter, undertook to maintain, that his Mi&s;tre&s;s was fairer then <HI>Onoria:</HI> Whereupon they came to a Fight, in which <HI>Birmartes</HI> was Victorious, and carry'd the Por|traiture of <HI>Luciana</HI> into his Ve&s;&s;el, where he fa&s;tned it to the Pillar with a little Chain underneath the other. After this he had &s;everal Combats with many other good Knights: But he car'd not for having the Effigies of tho&s;e, they lov'd, not thinking them worthy to accompany his Portraiture, unle&s;s they were the Daughters of Emperors or Kings: For to that, and no more, he was oblig'd.</P>
<P>After this he made no long &s;tay in <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> but taking leave of the Emperor and the Knights of his Court, went to <HI>Macedonia,</HI> where he won the Image of the Infanta <HI>Alegria,</HI> the Kings Daughter, gaining the Victory over a Duke, who was greatly in love with her, as al&s;o over many others, which would be tedious to name.</P>
<P>Thence he took his way to <HI>Bohemia,</HI> where he entred the Field again&s;t another Duke, from whom he gain'd the Statue of <HI>Imperia,</HI> Daughter to King <HI>Gra&s;andor,</HI> and Queen <HI>Mabita,</HI> who was a beautiful and gallant
<PB N="198" REF="106"> Prince&s;s; but yet &s;he remain'd there for a Pledge, accompany'd with many other Ladies and Gentlewoman: Whence his Fame &s;pred &s;o far, that he was from that time in all tho&s;e parts nam'd the <HI>Knight us'd to over|come.</HI></P>
<P>Then &s;eeing, that there was none left in <HI>Bohemia</HI> to oppo&s;e him, he took a Re&s;olution of going to <HI>Naples,</HI> having been advertiz'd that the King had a Daughter nam'd <HI>Jufaliana,</HI> a Lady of extraordinary Beauty. And indeed he was &s;ailing thither, when he met, the <HI>Knight of the burning Sword.</HI> So they fought, and were at la&s;t parted, as you have heard, at which he was &s;o di&s;pleas'd, that he &s;aid at every turn, he never &s;hould have any Sa|tisfaction, till he found him again. Wherefore we &s;hall &s;ay no more of him till a fitter Opportunity: For you well know, that this Hi&s;tory is not &s;o much for him, as for the <HI>Knight of the burning Sword,</HI> who&s;e Prowe&s;s and valor we intend chiefly here to de&s;cribe.</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P>How the <HI>Knight of the Burning Sword</HI> Stole away from <HI>Gradamart,</HI> to go and &s;eek <HI>Birmartes,</HI> and what befel him.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>YOV have heard, how much di&s;pleas'd the <HI>Knight of the burning Sword</HI> was for having been parted from <HI>Birmartes</HI> by <HI>Gradamart,</HI> with whom he &s;hew'd him&s;elf &s;o offended, that during the &s;tay, he made for the Cure of his wounds, he would not &s;o much as &s;peak to him, or have any Di&s;cour&s;e with him. Neverthele&s;s the other ceas d not to perform the Office of a true Friend, in treating him in the be&s;t manner, he could, being however very much troubled at the ill Countenance, he &s;hewed him.</P>
<P>Now it hapned one night that the <HI>Knight of the burning Sword</HI> being almo&s;t recovered, and Mu&s;ing on the fight, he had with <HI>Birmartes,</HI> grew &s;o di&s;contented, that he quite lo&s;t his Re&s;t: And turning fir&s;t on the one &s;ide, then on the other, he &s;aid within him&s;elf: <HI>What do&s;t thou, poor Wretch, &s;o long in thy bed, di&s;honor'd as thou art? VVho hinders thee from go|ing to take Revenge of him, that loves her, whom none merits to &s;erve? I know not, why thou wert ever born into the world: nor what Rea&s;on mov'd thee to take Arms, making &s;uch ill u&s;e of them, that thou ha&s;t been &s;ain to endure in thy Pre&s;ence a Stranger bragging, and &s;inging the Love
<PB N="199" REF="106"> of thy Mi&s;tre&s;s, and (which is wor&s;e) to depart from thee with &s;o much Glory. Ah!

How unfortunate to me w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">s the Day, I fir&s;t &s;aw you &s;o beautifu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">, that being near you I dy, and ab|&s;ent from you, I cannot live! For GOD's &s;ake let me under&s;tand, if you have left me, to love this other, that obeying your VVill, I may find him where ever he is, not to do him any hurt, but to &s;erve him all my Life, if it is plea&s;ing to you. And neverthele&s;s it cannot &s;ink into my mind, that you have in &s;o &s;hort a time forgotten your Loyal Slave; &s;ince my heart (where ever you have been) has always &s;poken to you plainly, and without Di&s;&s;imulation: VVhich makes me believe, that you are not angry with me. VVherefore I will &s;tay no longer in this place, but will go and avenge you of him, who has ra&s;hly (without your Command) pre&s;umed to &s;erve and love you, which he &s;hall pay dear for, if I find him, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">r it &s;hall co&s;t me my Life.</HI></P>
<P>Having &s;aid this, his Fury in &s;uch manner encreas'd, that he ro&s;e ha&s;tily out of the B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">d, and &s;eeing, that <HI>Gradamart</HI> was a&s;leep, he put on his Armor, and having him&s;elf bridled <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">nd &s;adled one of the Hor&s;es, which <HI>Galeotes</HI> had given him, he rode to wards the Shore, where his Marriners were waiting, who all wondered to &s;ee him at &s;uch an hour. Then entring into his Ve&s;|&s;el, he commanded them to weigh Anchor, and follow Fortune, which could not (he &s;aid) be &s;o contrary to him, but that 'twould guide him to the Place, where he &s;hould meet the Knight, that had parted &s;o well from him. Then tho&s;e of the Ship askt him, whether he would plea&s;e to &s;tay for <HI>Gradamart.</HI></P>
<P><HI>No,</HI> an&s;wered he: <HI>He &s;hall no more hinder me from executing my Will, &s;o to di&s;grace me, as he has done.</HI></P>
<P>This Command they dur&s;t not any further di&s;pute, but letting loo&s;e their Ve&s;&s;el, without either Rudder, or Oar, went away with the Curent of the &s;tream, being driven along by the Wind and Waves, &s;ix days toge|ther, at the End whereof they met a Ship, on the Deck of which &s;at a very ancient Man, whom the <HI>Knight of the burning Sword</HI> &s;aluted, &s;aying to him: <HI>Honorable Father, GOD pre&s;erve you: I de&s;ire you of Courte&s;y to tell me, if you have &s;een met, or know any News of a Knight, that &s;ails along this Sea in an unu&s;ual manner: for I mu&s;t find him dead or living.</HI></P>
<P>Then he gave him the be&s;t De&s;cription, he could, of <HI>Birmartes:</HI> wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ch the Old-man having heard, made him this An&s;wer: <HI>Your finding of him, Sir Knight, will perhaps be much more to your Dammage than Profit, he being &s;uch an one, that there are few better, or indeed &s;o good to be found
<PB N="200" REF="107"> in the world. Neverthele&s;s, &s;ince you &s;o affectionatly reque&s;t it, I will tell you what I know. He has taken his Cour&s;e towards</HI> Naples, <HI>in the way to which I met him: and that is all you can at this time learn of him.</HI></P>
<P><HI>GOD give you a good Voyage,</HI> &s;aid the <HI>Knight of the burning Sword: You have greatly &s;atisfied me.</HI></P>
<P>Then commanding his Steer&s;man to make &s;trait for <HI>Naples,</HI> they &s;oon lo&s;t &s;ight of each other.</P>
<P>In the mean time <HI>Gradamart,</HI> who had fetcht a long &s;leep, awoke, and finding neither his Companion, nor his Arms, was exceedingly di&s;con|tented. Then he went &s;trait to the Shore, thinking to meet the Ve&s;&s;el, in which they came: but there was not the lea&s;t Sign of it. Wherefore he began to cur&s;e and ban his Fortune, which was &s;o contrary to him, that ha|ving on &s;o Good an Occa&s;ion pre&s;erv'd two of the Be&s;t Knights in the World from Death, he &s;hould Receive for it &s;o much Di&s;plea|&s;ure.</P>
<P>And in this di&s;content he cry'd out: <HI>Ah, ah!</HI> Knight of the Burning Sword! <HI>how ill do You know the great Amity your Friend</HI> Gradama<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">t <HI>bears You! You had &s;urely little rea&s;on thus to for&s;ake me. Little Rea|&s;on did I &s;ay? No, no, You had great Rea&s;on, &s;ince I bear &s;uch Affection to him, who &s;o little e&s;teems me, having &s;o &s;trangely ab&s;ented him&s;elf from me. But, let what may befal me, I will never cea&s;e Travelling, till I have found you, that I may complain of you to your &s;elf.</HI></P>
<P>As he was thus venting his Di&s;contents, he perceived on the Shore a Fi&s;her-Boat, into which having put &s;ome Provi&s;ions, he entred, and having unfa&s;tned it from a Po&s;t, to which it was ty'd, abandon'd it to the Waves, that in a little time carry'd him out of &s;ight of the Land, &s;o di&s;contented, that he every moment wi&s;ht his own Death, when he met the &s;ame Old-man that had &s;poken to the <HI>Knight of the Burning Sword,</HI> whom he askt, whe|ther he could tell him any News of a Knight, great of Stature, and Ar|med in white Harne&s;s, who Sailed in a Boat, accompany'd only by two Marriners.</P>
<P><HI>In truth,</HI> an&s;wer'd the Old Man, <HI>you enquire after him, in finding whom you &s;hall have greater Joy than you imagin: and you your &s;elf &s;hall be more &s;ought after by him, than he is by you: and more I will not tell you at this time.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Gradamart</HI> greatly wondred at this Di&s;cour&s;e, and would have de&s;ir'd him to tell him what he meant: but the Old Man had &s;carce fini&s;ht his &s;peech, when a brisk Gale of Wind carry'd away the Ve&s;&s;el he was in, &s;o that <HI>Gra|damart</HI> could no more get near him. Wherefore he re&s;olved to follow his
<PB N="201" REF="107"> Adventure, and not to leave &s;eeking his Companion, who &s;teering, as you have been fold, &s;trait towards <HI>Naples,</HI> bethought him&s;elf to change his Name, commanding his Marriners to call him thenceforward only the <HI>Knight without Fortune.</HI></P>
<P>Now it happened that the &s;econd day after he had &s;poken to the Old-man, the Sea grew &s;o Tem<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">e&s;tuous, that he was forc'd to take Port in <HI>Civita Vecchia</HI> near <HI>Rome,</HI> where he went a&s;hore, bidding his Marriners to go and &s;tay for him near <HI>Naples,</HI> whither him&s;elf would go by Land. Wherefore he mounted his Steed, and took the great road: along which he perceived a Dam&s;el coming, accompany'd by one only Squire, carrying a Pacquet, wrapt up in red Camblet.</P>
<P>The <HI>Knight of the Burning Sword</HI> courteou&s;ly &s;aluted them, and they returned his &s;alutation, the Dam&s;el &s;aying to him: <HI>Perhaps, Sir Knight, you are one of tho&s;e who have &s;lain the Emperor of the Countrey.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Why do you &s;ay this to me?</HI> an&s;wer'd the Knight.</P>
<P><HI>Becau&s;e,</HI> reply'd &s;he, <HI>that, if you are of that Faction, I advi&s;e you to take another way, than this of</HI> Rome: <HI>for the Marque&s;s of</HI> Mantua <HI>is entred into it, with a good Number of Soldiers, and keeps it for the Empre&s;s</HI> Leo|norina, <HI>and her Grand-daughter, to whom the Empire comes by right of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion. And whatever Knight, or other Per&s;on he finds, holding the part of the Duke, he certainly puts them to death.</HI></P>
<P><HI>I pray you, Dam&s;el,</HI> &s;aid the <HI>Knight of the Burning Sword, to give me an Account of this Emperor's Death: For I never heard of it, but from you.</HI></P>
<P>Then &s;he began to relate to him the Dukes Trea&s;on, as you have heard it. <HI>And,</HI> &s;aid &s;he, <HI>the Marque&s;s has, within the&s;e few days, had News, that King</HI> Amadis <HI>is arriv'd at</HI> Naples, <HI>to revenge the Death of the Emperor, his Son-in-law: at which &s;everal of this Countrey are very joyful, and expect great Forces from all parts, as is reported.</HI></P>
<P><HI>As the Gods may help me, Dam&s;el,</HI> an&s;wer'd the <HI>Knight of the burning Sword, I am very glad that I am arriv'd in time to do &s;ervice to the King you &s;peak of: for I greatly love and e&s;teem him</HI></P>
<P><HI>Ah!</HI> &s;aid &s;he: <HI>You have Rea&s;on, and as far as I &s;ee, my way is &s;horten'd, becau&s;e I was charg'd to addre&s;s my &s;elf to the fir&s;t Knight, I &s;hould meet on this way, making me &s;uch Di&s;cour&s;es as you do, and pre&s;ent him what is in this Pacquet. And neverthele&s;s I will cau&s;e it to be carried for you to the City of</HI> Naples, <HI>whither I will accompany you, as I am charg'd: and there I will tell you who it is that &s;ends it to you and other things, for which you will not be &s;orry.

<P><HI>In good Faith, Dam&s;el,</HI> an&s;wer'd the <HI>Knight of the Burning Sword, you make me wonder at the News.

<P><HI>Let us go,</HI> &s;aid &s;he, <HI>I pray you.</HI></P>
<P>Then they both went on together; but they had not been two days in Company, when they entred into a long Forre&s;t, where they met Five Knights compleatly Arm'd, who, addre&s;&s;ing them&s;elves to him <HI>of the Bur|ning Sword,</HI> cry'd to him: <HI>Stay, Knight, &s;tay: You mu&s;t tell us, whom you will A&s;&s;i&s;t, whether the Emperor of</HI> Rome, <HI>or his Adver&s;ary.</HI></P>
<P><HI>I will help,</HI> an&s;wer'd he, <HI>tho&s;e, in whom Trea&s;on has no Part, and will be again&s;t the Duke, who has &s;o ba&s;ely Murther'd his Lord.</HI></P>
<P><HI>This,</HI> reply'd they, <HI>is the Way, you &s;hould take to a &s;peedy Death.</HI></P>
<P>Having &s;aid this, they all couch'd their Lances, and ran upon him with &s;uch violence, that they wanted but little of throwing him out of his Sad|dle; yet he kept firm, and gave one of them &s;uch a Blow, that he never Spake more: Then he drew his Spear out of the Dead-Mans Body, and Charging the Four others, Kill'd the Second on the Field, his Staff breaking to Shivers. Then he &s;uddenly put hand to his Sword, and there began between them a wonderful Fight, which yet &s;oon came to an End; for the Three that remain'd, could not bear the Fury of him, who, in &s;uch manner A&s;&s;aulted them, that the Third had his Head Cleft a&s;under; which the Two la&s;t &s;eeing, turn'd their Backs, and Fled away full Speed. But the <HI>Knight of the Burning Sword</HI> let them go, and without pur&s;uing them any farther, follow'd his way with the Dam&s;el, who, much wondred at his great Prowe&s;s, and high Chivalry. Now the&s;e Ra&s;cals were Allies of the Duke, who, lying in Ambu&s;h in the Forre&s;t, watcht &s;uch Knights as were ill Accompany'd, and fell upon them, when they under&s;tood them to be of the Deceas'd Emperor's Party; &s;o that many Worthy Men had already, in this manner lo&s;t their Lives, when they met with the <HI>Knight of the Burning Sword,</HI> who, Cha&s;tis'd them, as you have heard. And for this cau&s;e, we will leave him to Travel with the Dam&s;el, and change our Di&s;cour&s;e.</P>

<P>OVR Hi&s;tory has before acquainted you, how the King of <HI>Sicily, Olorius,</HI> and <HI>Don Florelus,</HI> Embarkt in Great <HI>Britain</HI> with a good Number of other Knights, and &s;et Sail for <HI>France.</HI> Now they had not Sail'd Eight whole Days, when they met &s;ome Ve&s;&s;els Commanded by the Count of <HI>Armignac,</HI> a Kin&s;man to the King of <HI>Metz,</HI> for who&s;e &s;ake they were Crui&s;ing along the Coa&s;ts to hinder the <HI>Sicilians,</HI> or any other of their Party from taking Port in <HI>Sicily.</HI> Now the Count immediatly knew
<PB N="204" REF="109"> by the Banners and Colors, that the King of <HI>Sicily,</HI> was in the Fleet; wherefore he commanded his People to a&s;&s;ault it on all &s;ides, hoping to take him Pri&s;oner. Then the two Fleets joyn'd, and with Hooks and Grapling Irons, coupled their Ve&s;&s;els, &s;o that the Fight was Fierce and Bloody; but at length the <HI>Armignacians</HI> had the wor&s;t, being all either Slain, or Vanqui&s;ht, and the others remain'd Victorious, by means whereof they un|der&s;tood from the Pri&s;oners, how the Emperor <HI>Arqui&s;il,</HI> and his Son <HI>Di|nerpius</HI> were Slain, and that King <HI>Amadis</HI> was Arriv'd at <HI>Naples,</HI> where he was gathering People from all Parts, to Revenge their Deaths; as al|&s;o that the King of <HI>Metz</HI> was Rai&s;ing a great Army to Succor the new Emperor. This being heard by the King of <HI>Sicily,</HI> a thought came &s;udden|ly into his Mind, that &s;ince his Enemy was taking that way, he &s;hould ne|ver find a better Opportunity to Recover his Kingdom, than whil&s;t his Adver&s;ary was ab&s;ent; and for this cau&s;e, he order'd his Pilots and Mari|ners to make all the &s;peed they could; but as it often happens, that Man propo&s;es otherwi&s;e than GOD has di&s;pos'd, the Night following there aro&s;e &s;uch a Tempe&s;t, that being carry'd along by the Violence of it, they found them&s;elves the Sixth Day after in the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Sea, and were, whe|ther they would or no, forc't to pa&s;s <HI>Hercules</HI>'s Pillars, and enter into the <HI>Mediterranean:</HI> Wherefore they wholly chang'd their De&s;ign, and the King of <HI>Sicily</HI> was of Opinion to go and find King <HI>Amadis,</HI> that they might to|gether Fight the V&s;urper of the Empire, and his Ally, &s;ince they were joyn'd.</P>
<P>Thus they took their way to <HI>Naples,</HI> where they arriv'd almo&s;t at the &s;ame time as did <HI>Don Flore&s;tan,</HI> King of <HI>Sardinia,</HI> who was come thither with a great Fleet, and the Duke of <HI>Calabria,</HI> who, being in Love with the Fair <HI>Jufaliana,</HI> Daughter to the King of <HI>Naples,</HI> had brought a great Army by Land.

<ARGUMENT>
<P>How <HI>Dirmartes</HI> arriv'd at the Court of <HI>Naples,</HI> where he defy'd all the Knights who were there, concerning their Mi&s;tr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;&s;es Beauties, and the Wonders he did.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THe&s;e Kings and great Lords being one Day &s;at at Dinner, there en|tred into the Hall, a Tall and Comely Knight, compleatly Arm'd in a Rich White Armor. In his Hands he bore the Effigies of a Lady, at who&s;e &s;ide were certain little Chains of Gold, to which were fa&s;tned thr&eacute;e Images, that were &s;upported by two Knights. He, who Marcht fir&s;t, was <HI>Birmartes</HI> the Amorous, of whom our Hi&s;tory has formerly &s;poken at large, who (without doing any Act of Reverence) askt a loud, if the King of <HI>Naples</HI> was there, and was an&s;wer'd, that he was, and was &s;hewn him.</P>
<P>Then did he addre&s;s him&s;elf fir&s;t to the King, and afterwards to all the other Knights, &s;aying, <HI>Mo&s;t Mighty Kings and Lords, think it not &s;trange, that pre&s;enting my &s;elf before you, I have not &s;hewn that Sub|mi&s;&s;ion, which your Excellencies de&s;erve; the Rea&s;on of which is, that I bear in my Arms this Image, which is the Repre&s;entation of a Prince&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">, who&s;e Greatne&s;s is &s;uch, that She ows no Re&s;pect to any King or Emperor, how powerful &s;oever. And this I &s;ay farther, that my Arrival in this Court is only to maintain again&s;t all Knights, that</HI> Onoria, <HI>Lady of Beauty, Infanta of</HI> Apolonia, <HI>is Fairer than any other Lady or Dam&s;el in the World. And this I intend to prove by Arms again&s;t any one, that will contradict it, on &s;uch Condition, that, if the Opponent is Servant or Friend to the Daughter of any King or Emperor, for who&s;e Love he enters into Fight again&s;t me, he &s;hall be Bound to bring her Image Crown'd, and her Name Writ underneath, which he &s;hall lo&s;e, and I will joyn with the&s;e others, in ca&s;e the Victory is mine; but if the Knight has a Mi&s;tre&s;s of Meaner Rank, he &s;hall be excus'd from bringing her Image or Portraiture. Now then, Sir,</HI> &s;aid he to the King of <HI>Naples, &s;ince this Adventure is ar|riv'd in your Court, before it is in any other of the&s;e Princes, I be&s;eech you to cau&s;e the occa&s;ion of my Coming, being &s;uch, as I have at pre&s;ent declar'd to you, to be Publi&s;ht by Sound of Trumpet, to the end every Knight, who will Combat me, may know, that I will expect him in this
<PB N="206" REF="110"> Meadow in a Tent, which I will cau&s;e to be &s;et up, and will Fight him with &s;uch Arms, as he will Choo&s;e.</HI></P>
<P>Having &s;aid this, he went out of the Hall, and return'd the way he came, leaving all the&s;e Lords Amaz'd at his Pre&s;umption, &s;o that &s;everal de&s;ign'd to abate it, e&s;pecially the Duke of <HI>Calabria,</HI> and <HI>Clorius</HI> of <HI>Spain,</HI> who &s;o fer|vently Lov'd <HI>Luciana,</HI> Daughter to <HI>E&s;plandian,</HI> that he could not re&s;t for her. Then came <HI>Birmartes</HI> into the Meadow, and caus'd two Rich Pa|vilions to be &s;et up on the Sea &s;ho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">e, in which he Lodg'd. But he had Lei&s;ure enough to re&s;t there, for none Pre&s;ented him&s;elf that Day, no, the next till after Dinner, when &s;everal entred into the Field; and <HI>Birmartes</HI> behav'd him&s;elf &s;o Valiantly, that before Night he Vanqui&s;ht Twelve, and Fifteen the Day following; &s;o that many had &s;aid, they never &s;een &s;o good a Knight. Now the Duke of <HI>Calabria</HI> was not yet come, but he Pre&s;ented him&s;elf &s;oon after, Arm'd in Green Armor, and bearing on his Helmet, in|&s;tead of a Feather, his Mi&s;tre&s;&s;es Portraiture.</P>
<P>Then <HI>Birmartes,</HI> knowing that he had a Valiant Adver&s;ary, cho&s;e a great Lance, and Marching lei&s;urely, before he began his Carrier, the Duke call'd out to him from afar; &s;aying, <HI>By my Head, Sir Knight, I will now make you know, that the Prince&s;s</HI> Iufaliana, <HI>who&s;e Effigies I bear, &s;urpa&s;&s;es in all Beauties her, whom you have &s;o much prais'd.</HI></P>
<P><HI>I know not,</HI> an&s;wer'd <HI>Birmartes how you can verify it: As for me, every one knows, that I &s;hould extreamly forget my &s;elf, if I &s;hould follow this Opinion; and &s;ince the Proof lies in the Combat, not in Words, let us &s;ee how it will go.</HI></P>
<P>Then they couch'd their Lances, one again&s;t the other, and their Meet|ing was &s;uch, that the Duke broke his Spear, even to the Gantlet: Ne|verthele&s;s, <HI>Birmartes</HI> Struck him &s;o to the purpo&s;e, that he Threw him out of his Saddle to the Ground. And fora&s;much as the Duke was a&s;tony'd, &s;tiring neither Foot nor Hand, the other alighted from his Hor&s;e at the End of the Carrier, and Feigning, that he would Cut off his Head, &s;aid to him aloud: <HI>Knight, confe&s;s the Beauty of your Mi&s;tre&s;s to be nothing in Compari&s;on of</HI> Onorias, <HI>el&s;e you &s;hall Dye pre&s;ently.</HI></P>
<P>But to the&s;e Threats the Duke, tho' he was come to him&s;elf, An&s;wer'd him not a Word, but was &s;o Di&s;conted, that he wi&s;ht him&s;elf already Dead; which &s;ome Lord knowing, Reque&s;ted <HI>Birmartes</HI> to leave him in Patience, and content him&s;elf with his Victory, and the Portraiture of <HI>Jufaliana,</HI> which he took, and carry'd into his Pavilion, to Accompany the others. In the mean time the Duke got up again, and Return'd A&s;ham'd to his Hou&s;e.</P>
<PB N="207" REF="110">
<P>Then there came into the Field a lu&s;ty Knight, &s;itting &s;o gracefully on his Hor&s;e, that 'twas a wonder to &s;ee, who addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to <HI>Birmartes,</HI> thus &s;pake to him: <HI>If you do not willingly confe&s;s my Mi&s;tre&s;s to be fairer than yours, I will make you do it by force.</HI></P>
<P><HI>How?</HI> an&s;wered <HI>Birmartes: He, who is ju&s;t now parted with di&s;grace, &s;aid as much to me not long &s;ince, and tho' he &s;hould have &s;erv'd you for an Example, you &s;peak as pre&s;umptuou&s;ly, as he did: take heed, fair Sir, le&s;t as much befal you.</HI></P>
<P>At this word they ran &s;o directly one again&s;t the other, that their Lances flew into &s;hivers, and they met &s;o violently with Shi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">lds and Bodies, that <HI>Birmartes</HI> lo&s;t a &s;tirrup, and, if he had not caught hold of his Hor&s;es Neck, had been thrown to the ground: Neverthele&s;s the other had wor&s;e, he and his Ho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;e falling one upon the other. However he got up again, and taking his Sword in his hand, &s;aid to <HI>Birmartes,</HI> who had already turn'd his Bri|dle: <HI>Knight, alight, and GOD forbid, that I &s;hould twice, thro' my hor|&s;es fault, lo&s;e the Right of my Enterpri&s;e.</HI></P>
<P>Then <HI>Birmartes</HI> &s;at foot to ground, and embracing his Shield, there be|gan between them &s;o fierce a Fight, that for the &s;pace of an hour or more, it could hardly be judged, who would have the better or the wor&s;e. But at the end the Vnknown Knight was &s;o out of breath, that he was forc't to retreat a little back. Which <HI>Birmartes</HI> &s;eeing, &s;aid to him: <HI>Indeed, Sir Knight, you take an ill way to make me confe&s;s &s;o great a Lye, as you ere-while bragg'd, you would: Are you already &s;o tired?</HI></P>
<P>The other, very much vext at this mockery, thus an&s;wered him: <HI>Sir Knight, you &s;hall know pre&s;ently.</HI> And lifting up his Arm, gave <HI>Birmar|tes</HI> &s;uch a blow with his Sword that his eyes &s;parkled, and their fight be|gan again &s;o fierce, that &s;ometimes Fortune was judg'd to be for the Vn|known Knight, and &s;ometimes for <HI>Birmartes.</HI> Neverthele&s;s the end was &s;uch, that <HI>Birmartes</HI> gain'd the Victory, and the other fell upon the field, &s;o tired, that he was quite &s;pent.</P>
<P>Wherefore <HI>Birmartes</HI> ca&s;t him&s;elf lightly upon him, and plucking off his Helmet, perceived that 'twas his Brother <HI>Olorius:</HI> at which much di&s;con|tented, as fearing him to be wor&s;e than he was, he &s;aid to him: <HI>Sir Knight, 'tis probable that the Fault of your Mi&s;tre&s;&s;es Beauty, and not your want of Prowe&s;s, is the cau&s;e, of what has befallen you: for otherwi&s;e (&s;eeing what I have found in you) 'tis certain, that I &s;hould not &s;o lightly have parted out of your hands, as I have done.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Olorius,</HI> hearing him &s;peak with &s;o much humility, altho' he was extream|ly di&s;contented, thus an&s;wered him: <HI>As GOD help me, Knight, I can give you no very good Account of my Mi&s;tre&s;&s;es Beauty: for I never &s;aw her:
<PB N="208" REF="111"> But I &s;hould have con&s;idered, what is in you, before my undertaking any thing, at lea&s;t to avoid the &s;hame, I undergo.</HI></P>
<P>Then he got up, and gave <HI>Birmartes</HI> his hand to help him: for he was very much wounded: nor was <HI>Birmartes</HI> much le&s;s. Wherefore retiring, the one into the Town, and the other into his Pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ilion, they kept their beds fifteen days, before their Wounds were cur'd.</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P>How a &s;trange Knight came to fight with <HI>Birmartes;</HI> and what befel them.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>BIrmartes</HI> then being cured, and re&s;olving to begin again his En|terpri&s;e, there entered into his Pavilion a Dam&s;el, accompany'd by an E&s;quire, who carried a Casket, clo&s;ely wrapt up This Dam&s;el Saluted <HI>Birmartes</HI> with great Courte&s;y, and untying the Packet, pre&s;ented him with a Suit of Armor, as red as blood, and a Shield, having an Elm in a Field, <HI>Or,</HI> &s;aying to him: Knight us'd to overcome, <HI>He, who loves you, and e&s;teems you, for the Prowe&s;s that is in you, &s;ends you this Pre&s;ent: And &s;ends you word by me, that at this time you &s;hall not know who he is: But &s;o it is, that this Armor, which he has kept for you, will do you more Service than you think for.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Dam&s;el, my Friend,</HI> an&s;wered he, <HI>I humbly thank the per&s;on, who has had &s;o good a Remembrance of me, and e&s;t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">em this Harne&s;s the more, be|cau&s;e mine was quite broken. You will be pl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">as'd to tell him, that, where|ever I am, he has in me a Knight very much at his Command.</HI></P>
<P>Then without continuing this Di&s;cour&s;e any longer, the Dam&s;el depar|ted from him, leaving him in a deep &s;tudy, from whom &s;o g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">eat a Favour &s;hould proceed. And that very day he acquainted the Kings, and the other Lords, that he &s;hould be in a readine&s;s, if any one will defend the Honour of his Mi&s;tre&s;&s;es Beauty. Wherefore going forth of the Town, they went to the Place appointed, with a great Number of People, whither they were no &s;ooner come, but they perceived a Knight of great Stature, riding towards them, mounted on a Roan Hor&s;e, his Armor being <HI>Azure,</HI> covered with ma|ny
<PB N="209" REF="111"> Stars, and his Shield of the &s;ame. In his hand he held a great Lance, which he re&s;ted on his Thigh with &s;uch a Grace, that nothing could exceed it. And to the top of his Helmet was fa&s;tned the Portraiture of a Dam|&s;el, fair in all Perfection.</P>
<P>In this Equipage did he pa&s;s before the Scaffold, on which the Kings were &s;itting, whom he &s;aluted w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">thout di&s;covering him&s;elf; and approach|ing <HI>Birmartes,</HI> &s;aid to him loud enough: <HI>Knight, you mu&s;t grant me, that &s;he, whom you love, no way equals the Lady, who&s;e Figure I bear; el&s;e your Head &s;hall do me rea&s;on, as a Puni&s;hment of your audacious folly in compairing her to a Lady, to whom &s;he de&s;erves not to be &s;o much as a &s;ervant.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Birmartes,</HI> much di&s;pleas'd to hear him&s;elf threatned, and his Lady inju|red, thus an&s;wered: <HI>Truly, good Sir, you &s;peak very gloriou&s;ly, and my &s;tay in this place would have been too much in vain, if I &s;hould, for your Threats, confe&s;s &s;o great a lye: But I hope, before you get from me, to cha&s;ti&s;e you in &s;uch a manner, that you &s;hall be an Example to tho&s;e, that may come hereafter. And as to my head, I &s;hall keep it better, than you will do yours, as will be &s;een by the Event.</HI></P>
<P>Then they parted to fetch their Carreer, and ran again&s;t each other with &s;uch Fury, that they both fell to the Ground, where they lay &s;ome time with|out &s;tirring either hand or foot. And every one began to think them dead, when they got up again, embracing their Shields, and taking their Swords in their hands. Then they began &s;o fierce a Fight, that the &s;ound of their Blows would have made one think, there had been above twenty Knights in Battle, and the Sparks of fire flew in &s;uch quantity from their Armor, that the Iron, taken out of the Furnace, and beaten on the Anvil, yields no greater Lu&s;tre. But what need is there to number their Blows for the Embelli&s;hment of our Hi&s;tory? They charg'd each other with &s;o much vi|olence, that, had it not been for the Goodne&s;s of their Armor, they had &s;oon made an End of the Combat, with the lo&s;s of both their Lives. But &s;eeing that their Swords could not enter, they clos'd body to body, doing their ut|mo&s;t to bring each other to the Ground. In which they profited as little as before tho' they cont<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">nu'd in this E&s;tate above two long hours, &s;o that every one thought them faint and out of breath. Neverthele&s;s they &s;oon after knew the contrary: For the two Combatants return'd again to take their Swords, and as if they had done nothing all the day, began again their fight more &s;harp and dangerous than before. And neverthele&s;s, either for the temper of their Armor, or the thickne&s;s and goodne&s;s of them, neither of them could draw the lea&s;t drop of blood from his Adver&s;ary.</P>
<P>At which they both wondred, and principally the Knight of the Stars,
<PB N="210" REF="112"> who &s;aid to the other: As far as I &s;ee, Knight, we toil all day without gai|ning any Advantage, one over the other, &s;ince our Swords cut no better: therefore, pray, let us di&s;arm our &s;elves, and to put a more &s;peedy end to this beginning, let us take only Sword and Cloak: for had I thought of what is fallen out, I &s;hould have entered otherwi&s;e into Fight again&s;t you.</P>
<P>When <HI>Birmartes</HI> heard this Di&s;cour&s;e, he very much wondred at his Enemies great Courage, and immediatly doubted, that 'twas he, with whom he had to do upon the Sea, when they were part<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">d.

<P><HI>Well then,</HI> &s;aid the Knight of the Stars, <HI>I thought to have done you a Plea&s;ure.</HI></P>
<P>If then they had before been very careful to do their Duties, they retur|ned to &s;hew them&s;elves yet more earne&s;t, altho' they apparently grew hea|vier, having already continu'd above five hours without any re&s;t: And moreover the Heat of the day was to extreme, that he, who was lighte&s;t cloath'd, did perpetually &s;weat. Which mov'd King <HI>Amadis</HI> to &s;uch com|pa&s;&s;ion, &s;eeing them &s;uffer and endure &s;o much, that he could not forbear &s;aying to the others: <HI>On my con&s;cience 'tis great Pity to let two of the be&s;t Knights in the world dye, who are &s;o animated one again&s;t the other, that the Conqueror will never pardon the Weaker,</HI></P>
<P>Neverthele&s;s he of the Stars gain'd ground by little and little; whence with gayety of heart, &s;haking his Sword, he cry'd out: <HI>Ha!

<P>Having &s;aid this, he p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">e&s;s'd him clo&s;er, than he had yet done.

<P>Having &s;aid this word, he ru&s;ht upon the other, and &s;truck him &s;o fierce|ly on the top of his Helmet, that he con&s;train'd him to put his knee to the ground: but he &s;oon got up again, and in revenge gave his Adver&s;ary &s;uch a blow in the &s;ame place, that his two hands &s;erv'd him for a &s;upport on the Gra&s;s, tho' he made there no long &s;tay, but re&s;ettling his Helmet, they be|gan again better than before: not but there was always di&s;cern'd &s;ome lit|tle Advantage on the &s;ide of the <HI>Knight of the burning &s;word.</HI> And indeed he was de&s;cended of the mo&s;t illu&s;trious and glorious blood at that day on the Earth, having to his great Grand father King <HI>Amadis,</HI> who con&s;idering that, if he let them Fight any longer, the Death of the other was near, &s;aid to the three Kings, which were &s;itting by him, that 'twas better to go and pray them to part, &s;eeing the great Lo&s;s, there would be in lo&s;ing them.</P>
<P>Which they approv'd, and going down from their Scaffolds, went to the two Knights, who at their coming drew back, and King <HI>Amadis,</HI> and the King of <HI>Sicily</HI> addre&s;s'd them&s;elves to the <HI>Knight of the burning &s;word,</HI> to whom they &s;aid: <HI>Knight, be pleas'd to do &s;o much for our &s;akes, as to pro|ceed no farther in this Combat: for 'tis not rea&s;onable, that two &s;uch gal|lant men, as you are, &s;hould dye on &s;o &s;mall an occa&s;ion.</HI></P>
<P>He, who pre&s;ently thought, that by refu&s;ing &s;o courteous a Reque&s;t, made him by &s;uch Per&s;ons, as they were, particularly by the Father of her, whom he lov'd better than his own &s;oul, he might be blam'd, thus an&s;wered them: <HI>For certain, my Lords, 'tis grievous for me to retire thus, neverthele&s;s de|&s;iring to obey you in all things, let us know, what mine Enemy thinks of it, again&s;t whom I am the mo&s;t unfortunate Knight, that ever was: for this is now the &s;econd time, that he has e&s;cap'd from me, with more ho|nour, than I de&s;ire.</HI></P>
<P><HI>I a&s;&s;ure you,</HI> &s;aid King <HI>Amadis, that he will do, what he &s;hall be reque|&s;ted to by the Kings of</HI> Naples <HI>and</HI> Sardinia: Who in the mean time was per&s;wading <HI>Birmartes</HI> to con&s;ent to the &s;ame.</P>
<P>To which he willingly gave ear, knowing he had the wor&s;t, altho' he bravely conceal'd, what he thought of it. And for this Cau&s;e he &s;aid to them: <HI>My Lords, the Quarrel be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ween this Knight and me is &s;uch, that I &s;hould rather choo&s;e to lo&s;e my Life, than leave this Combat: but for
<PB N="212" REF="113"> your &s;ake, whom I de&s;ire to plea&s;e, I will obey your Command.</HI></P>
<P>So they led him into his Pavilion, leaving the King of great <HI>Britain,</HI> and <HI>Alpatracy</HI> with the other, whom <HI>Amadis</HI> indeed thought to be the <HI>Knight of the Burning Sword,</HI> and had already acquainted the King of <HI>Si|cily</HI> with his Su&s;picion, of which, that he might know the Truth, he made <HI>Alpatracy</HI> a &s;ign with his Eye to ask him, who therefore thus &s;pake to the Knight: <HI>I de&s;ire you Sir of Courte&s;y to tell me your Name: For I &s;u&s;|pect you to be a Gentleman, whom I greatly love and e&s;teem: And if you are the &s;ame, you would be to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="2 letters">ame to conceal your &s;elf, e&s;pecially from King</HI> Amadis, <HI>who has done that in</HI> Saba <HI>for him, whom I take you to be, that he will be for ever oblig'd to him.</HI></P>
<P>This he &s;aid, to draw the &s;ooner from the <HI>Knight of the burning Sword,</HI> what he de&s;ir'd: who was at fir&s;t &s;o a&s;toni&s;ht at this News, that he was a long time without an&s;wering, and would willingly have di&s;cover'd him|&s;elf, had it not been for the De&s;ire, he had to be reveng'd of <HI>Birmartes,</HI> whereever he could find him, thinking that he lov'd <HI>Lucella.</HI></P>
<P>Wherefore he thus an&s;wered the King: <HI>Sir I know not, what Love you bear me, nor whom you think me to be; but if you wi&s;h me any Good, 'tis not altogether without Rea&s;on; &s;ince I have all my Life de&s;ired to do Ser|vice to You, and &s;uch as You are. You will therefore be pleas'd to name to me him, for whom you take me, that I may better know who he is.</HI></P>
<P><HI>In good faith,</HI> &s;aid the King, <HI>he is nam'd the</HI> Knight of the burning Sword, <HI>and I well believe, that you are none of he: For he would never concel him&s;elf from me.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Certainly, Sir</HI> an&s;wer'd he, <HI>'tis not long, &s;ince I left him, and I am &s;o much his Friend, that I de&s;ire you for his &s;ake to tell me, what it is, that King</HI> Amadis <HI>has done for him in</HI> Saba, <HI>to the end, that, if I find him again, he may have News of it.</HI></P>
<P>Then <HI>Alpatracy</HI> related to him at large, how Queen <HI>Buruca</HI> had been accus'd, and what became of it.</P>
<P><HI>Ah!</HI> &s;aid the <HI>Knight of the burning Sword,</HI> in the mean time within him&s;elf; <HI>Traytor</HI> Maudan! <HI>the Gods have had too much pity of you! for without toiling &s;uch a Prince, you de&s;erv'd an Halter.</HI></P>
<P>Neverthele&s;s he gave no knowledge of this Fault, and le&s;s of his Per|&s;on, but thus an&s;wer'd King <HI>Alpatracy: Sir I am very glad, for the &s;ake of the</HI> Knight of the burning Sword, <HI>of &s;uch good News, with which I will a&s;&s;uredly acquaint him, and that, before it is long: Wherefore your Maje&s;ty will be pleas'd to give me leave, a&s;&s;uring you, if I can meet him, that we will bear you Company in the VVar, you undertake, whe|ther

<P>In this manner did he &s;top the Mouths of the&s;e two Princes, who af|terward importun'd him no farther, tho' they had &s;till a Fancy, that 'twas he him&s;elf.

</ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>SVCH was the I&s;&s;ue of this perillous Combat, as you have heard, at the Return from which the</HI> Knight of the Burning Sword, <HI>thinking &s;ometimes on his Misfortune in not having been able to Vanqui&s;h his Ene|my, &s;ometimes on his News of the King of</HI> Saba, <HI>and the Obligation, in which he found him&s;elf indebted to King</HI> Amadis, <HI>being now &s;ad, then all of a &s;udden joyful, Rode on to the Place, where he had left</HI> Alquif<HI>'s Dam|&s;el.

But when the Dam&s;el &s;aw him to pen&s;ive, &s;he could not forbear asking him, whence that Melancholly proceeded.</HI></P>
<P>Ah! my great Friend, <HI>an&s;wer'd he:</HI> I was thinking to leave this Coun|trey, for to go into <HI>Saba</HI> to find the King, for &s;ome News, I have this day heard, which touches me very near. And on the other &s;ide, I am forc'd to break this Enterpri&s;e, being call'd this way to an Affair, on
<PB N="214" REF="114"> which my Honor depends: Thus I &s;ee my &s;elf between two Extremities and know not which I &s;hould choo&s;e for the be&s;t.</P>
<P>If you think good, <HI>&s;aid &s;he,</HI> that I &s;hould carry any Me&s;&s;age for you to the Ea&s;t, be pleas'd to give me your Bark, and I will go, where you &s;hall command me, and will carry any Letter for you to King <HI>Magadan,</HI> whom I very well know.</P>

<P><HI>Di&s;cour&s;ing in this manner, they came, where the Bark was, and that very night, the Knight in the Starry Armor Writ a Letter to King</HI> Maga|dan, <HI>the Tenno<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter"> whereof follo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="2 letters">.</HI></P>
<P>Mo&s;t High, mo&s;t Mighty, and mo&s;t Excellent Prince, if future things were as pre&s;ent to men, as they are unknown to them, there would be few Per&s;ons deceiv'd, and fewer Wicked, that could deceive them by giving them fal&s;e Intelligence: But &s;uch a &s;ecret being out of our Power, we &s;hould (certainly) more fear this malice of men, than Death it &s;elf, which can deceive us but once. For that, to which the&s;e Traitors and Vil|lains lead us, takes not only away the Life, but the immortal Honour, which every Per&s;on of Virtue may acquire, blacking his Reputation and Honour by &s;hameful and lying Stories, with which they feed the ears of tho&s;e, who hear them. And of this (victorious King) your Maje&s;ty can better judge, than any other, having been upon the Point of being reputed an unju&s;t King, by your intending to put the Queen to Death, for the fal&s;e Accu&s;ation, made of her and your loyal &s;ubject and &s;ervant, the <HI>Knight of the Burning Sword.</HI> Not, Sir, that I will excu&s;e my &s;elf of the Fault, I committed, in ab&s;enting my &s;elf from your Court according to the Coun|&s;el given me by <HI>Maudan:</HI> for where my Innocence was, Puni&s;hment could have no place. And moreover, in&s;tead of leaving my honour doubtful by my Flight, I &s;hould rather (knowing your Vertue and my Ju&s;tice) &s;ubmit my &s;elf to your Cha&s;ti&s;ement, than fearing your Fury, and &s;hunning death, which I de&s;erv'd not, render my &s;elf thus &s;u&s;pected of Guilt. Now the Gods, as far, as I under&s;tand, have permitted, that the Truth has &s;ince been di&s;cover'd by the &s;ame Per&s;on, who had conceal'd it, and the Queens honour and mine re&s;tor'd by the invincible Prowe&s;s of <HI>Amadis,</HI> King of Great <HI>Britain,</HI> who, &s;u&s;taining my Right, has in your Maje&s;ty's Pre&s;ence &s;lain the Traitor in the plain Field of Battle. And neverthele&s;s, Sir, if there remains in you any &s;park of Di&s;plea&s;ure again&s;t your humble &s;ervant, I be&s;eeech you to forget it, and give me part in your good grace, till &s;uch time as I have opportunity to return to your Maje&s;ty, which I &s;hould have
<PB N="215" REF="114"> already done, had it not been for the Promi&s;e, I have made the&s;e Kings, here a&s;&s;embled, not to leave them, till the War, they have undertaken a|gain&s;t two other Traitors, is at an end. Wherefore you will be plea&s;ed to excu&s;e me, who in all humility ki&s;s your Maje&s;ties hands.</P>
<P><HI>This Letter being thus written, made up, and well &s;eal'd, he delivered it to the Dam&s;el, whom he took a&s;ide, and &s;aid to her:</HI> Dam&s;el my Friend, &s;ince you will do me the favour, to go for me to King <HI>Magadan,</HI> I be&s;eech you, in pre&s;enting to him this Letter, to tell him the occa&s;ion of my &s;tay in the&s;e Parts: and that, as &s;oon as I &s;hall have an Opportunity, I will not fail to repair to him, and pre&s;ent him with my &s;ervice, as I am bound. You will &s;ee al&s;o the Queen and Prince <HI>Fulurtin,</HI> to whom al&s;o I de&s;ire you to give my mo&s;t humble Re&s;pects.</P>
<P>Sir, <HI>an&s;werd &s;he,</HI> I will not fail to do, what you command me; but be|fore my Departure I will acquaint you, that the arms I pre&s;ented you was &s;ent you by the Sage <HI>Alquif,</HI> who loves you, and honours you more, than any Knight he knows. He has charged me to tell you, that your father is a <HI>Greek</HI> by Nation, and that you are the I&s;&s;ue of a mo&s;t Illu&s;trious Blood, and herewith content your &s;elf: for I can tell you no more, except it be that he &s;ends you word, that before your Departure from <HI>Italy,</HI> you &s;hall recover one of the things, you held mo&s;t for lo&s;t.</P>
<P><HI>The</HI> Knight of the burning Sword <HI>was much amaz'd, &amp; more rejoyc'd when he under&s;tood, that he was a Gentleman of Great Parentage, and imbracing her, who brought him this good News, &s;aid to her:</HI> Alas! my great Friend, for Gods &s;ake tell me then my Fathers Name, if you know it: For 'tis the greate&s;t De&s;ire, I have in this world.</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P>How News came to the Kings, being at <HI>Naples,</HI> of the great Preparation, made by the U&s;urper of the Empire, to come and give them Battle at <HI>Friuli:</HI> And of the Rancounter, they had with the King of <HI>Metz.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE King of <HI>Sicily,</HI> pretending, as you have heard, to the Kingdom of <HI>Metz,</HI> had ordinarily &s;pies in the Parts of <HI>Gaul,</HI> by whom (eight or ten dayes after the Fight, between the two good Knights <HI>Birmartes</HI> and <HI>Amadis</HI> of <HI>Greece,</HI> &s;urnamed formerly the <HI>Knight of the burning Sword</HI>) he was advertiz'd that the V&s;urper of the Empire, with his Forces, was, to come and joyn the King of <HI>Metz</HI> in the plain of <HI>Verona,</HI> and there to ex|pect King <HI>Amadis</HI> and his Army. Now the Duke of <HI>Lorrain</HI> was ally'd to King <HI>Amadis,</HI> and with all his might &s;upported the Party of the Empre&s;s his Daughter, &s;o that with &s;ix thou&s;and fighting Men he hindred, as much as po&s;&s;ibly he could, the King of <HI>Metz,</HI> who intended to pa&s;s thro' the Mar|ches of <HI>Suitzerland,</HI> from executing his De&s;igns: For he always coa&s;ted him, often con&s;training him to &s;tay longer in a place, than he de&s;ired. This was in part the Cau&s;e, that the Army of the&s;e Kings, a&s;&s;embled at <HI>Naples,</HI> went to look for them in <HI>Germany,</HI> and there to give them Battle: For which purpo&s;e 'twas proclaim'd in their Camp, that every one &s;hould make him&s;elf ready to remove the eighth day following.</P>
<P>During this Time there arriv'd from <HI>Spain</HI> &s;even thou&s;and good Soul|diers and Knights, which King <HI>Brian</HI> &s;ent by the Duke of <HI>Merida</HI> to their A&s;&s;i&s;tance, of whom <HI>Olorius</HI> had the Command. They then being a&s;&s;em|bled, <HI>Amadis,</HI> &s;eeing he had no News of the Army, he had &s;ent to rai&s;e in Great <HI>Britain,</HI> re&s;olved notwith&s;tanding to march with his Forces &s;trait to <HI>Aquileja,</HI> and thence to <HI>Marcadi Ancona,</HI> coa&s;ting always the <HI>Venetian,</HI> Sea, for the greater Convenience in having Provi&s;ions, till he came to <HI>Verona,</HI> where he had Advice, that the King of <HI>Metz</HI> was marching, into <HI>Germany</HI> for to get into <HI>Lombardy,</HI> and would there entrench him&s;elf, expecting the Emperors Forces. Then the&s;e Lords a&s;&s;embled in Coun&s;el, and re&s;olved to go and meet him, before the Emperor was got to him: Wherefore they remov'd on the morrow by break of day, and made &s;uch ha&s;t, that they got into the Mountains, before the King of <HI>Metz</HI> was aware of it, and &s;urpriz'd him &s;o &s;hort, that they pre&s;ented him the Battle, as it were on the &s;udden.</P>
<PB N="217" REF="115">
<P>Now he had with him a good Body of Hor&s;e, and a great Number of Foot, which the Count of <HI>Armignac,</HI> and the Dukes of <HI>Normandy</HI> and <HI>Brabant</HI> had brought thither, with &s;ome <HI>Germans</HI> out of Order. The Skirmi&s;h was on both &s;ides very fair, and the Fight at la&s;t &s;o fierce, that by the help of <HI>Birmartes, Florelus,</HI> and <HI>Amadis</HI> of <HI>Greece,</HI> who came thither unknown, the King of <HI>Metz</HI> was di&s;comfited, him&s;elf and the Ea l <HI>Ar|mignac</HI> &s;lain, together with the Duke of <HI>Savona,</HI> and his Son: So that had it not been for the favor of the Night, which &s;eparated them, the Duke of <HI>Normandy,</HI> and the re&s;t flying into the thicke&s;t part of a great Fore&s;t, there had not a Man of them e&s;cap'd. Then were <HI>Amadis</HI>'s People con&s;train'd to retire for the Darkne&s;s, and lodg'd in their Enemies Camp, keeping a good Watch; for they were told that the Duke of <HI>Normandy</HI> was rallying to come and find them again the next day.</P>
<P>Neverthel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;s it hapned otherwi&s;e: For the Duke, who was a di&s;creet and prudent <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">rince, con&s;idering the Wrong, which the decea&s;ed King had done the King of <HI>Sicily</HI> in V&s;urping the Countrey, that belong'd to Queen <HI>Miramynia</HI> his Wife; call'd the other Princes and Captains, who were retir'd with him, and remon&s;trated to them, that 'twould be be&s;t for them to &s;end to <HI>Alpatracy,</HI> and be&s;eech him, that forgetting the Injury, they had done him, he would be pleas'd to receive them into his Favor: And do|ing this, tho&s;e of the Kingdom of <HI>Metz</HI> would take an Oath of Fidelity to him, remaining for ever his humble and obedient Subjects and Va&s;&s;als: <HI>And I,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>and my Companions will be Friends, Allies, and Confede|rates, &s;erving, and favoring him again&s;t all, e&s;pecially again&s;t the Empe|ror, who &s;eeing the Trea&s;on, he has committed again&s;t his rightful Prince and Lord, cannot continue long without falling to ruine.</HI></P>
<P>There was not any one in the Company, who did not willingly give Ear to this Coun&s;el, and the Duke him&s;elf was cho&s;en by all to go to the King of <HI>Sicilies</HI> Camp, and carry him this Me&s;&s;age. By Means where|of, a&s;&s;oon as the Dawning of the Day began to appear, he took Hor&s;e, and accompany'd by the Principal Per&s;ons of the Kingdom of <HI>Metz,</HI> came to the Kings Tent, whither they were conducted by tho&s;e of the Watch, who found him, as he was arming him&s;elf.

<P>The Emperor, who was that day come to the City of <HI>Con&s;tance</HI> with his Army, was &s;oon advertiz'd of this, wherefore he made ha&s;t to hinder the E|nemy
<PB N="218" REF="116"> from pa&s;&s;ing any farther. But they met the eighth day after in the Evening, and the Skirmi&s;h began in a Village, where each of the two Armies de&s;ign'd to take up their Quarters. There many good Knights on both &s;ides ended their dayes, and had not the Night at that time favor'd the King of <HI>Sicilies</HI> Party, the <HI>Germans</HI> had gotten the Victory. But for|tune turn'd the next day: For <HI>Birmartes, Amadis</HI> of <HI>Greece, Olorious, Don Florelus, Orizenes</HI> and <HI>Bravatus,</HI> Sons to the Queens <HI>Calafia,</HI> and <HI>Pintequine&s;tra,</HI> drew up, and being accompany'd with many good Knights and Souldiers, a&s;&s;oon as they could &s;ee, whom to &s;trike, fiercely &s;et upon their Enemies. Now whil&s;t they were in the Head of the Fight, there came an Expre&s;s to the Emperour, which brought him News, that the City of <HI>Mentz</HI> was taken by a&s;&s;ault, the Garri&s;on put to the Sword, and the Widow of the deceas'd Emperor taken out of the Pri&s;on, to which &s;he had been confin'd.</P>

<P>This News indeed did not much plea&s;e the Emperor, nor tho&s;e, that heard it: and the Rumor of it ran &s;o thro' all the Camp, that many (even the mo&s;t part) lo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">t their hearts, and without being pur&s;u'd, fled &s;trait to the Ci|ty of <HI>Con&s;tance.</HI> Neverthele&s;s the Emperor ceas'd not to make head a|gain&s;t King <HI>Amadis,</HI> and the Fight on both &s;ides was &s;o fierce, that the Emperor him&s;elf was &s;lain on the Place, together with the Duke of <HI>Saxony,</HI> the Earl of <HI>Merida,</HI> his Son, and &s;everal Lords and Princes, with &s;o ma|ny other People of all &s;orts, that the Hor&s;es were in blood above the Pa&s;ters. But the Emperors Death &s;truck &s;uch a Terror into his Army, that they were immediatly di&s;comfited, and turning their backs, fled with all &s;peed towards <HI>Con&s;tance,</HI> where they inclos'd them&s;elves, leaving behind them above ten thou&s;and dead in the Field. And that very night was the City be&s;ieg'd, which, being briskly a&s;&s;aulted the next day, and as well defended, could not be taken till the fourth A&s;&s;ault, when it was Seal'd, and <HI>Amadis</HI>'s Troops got into it by force, putting all they found in it to the Sword, without &s;paring any living &s;oul. The&s;e <HI>Germans</HI> being thus vanqui&s;ht and defeated, King <HI>Amadis</HI> return'd to the Field, where the Battle had been the day befo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">e, and there caus'd the Bodies of the V&s;urper and his Kin&s;men to be &s;ought for, and being found, to be hang<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">d by the necks, and then burnt by a gentle Fire in puni&s;hment of the Trea&s;on he had com|mitted on the Per&s;on of the Emperor, his Brother-in-law, and his Son in law <HI>Dinerpius.</HI> Which he immediatly w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">it to Queen <HI>Oriana,</HI> a&s;&s;uring her, that he would return to her, as &s;oon as he had re&s;tor'd the Empre&s;s to her Liberty, and &s;etled her in the full Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions of her E&s;tate.</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P>How the City of <HI>Mentz</HI> was taken by A&s;&s;ault, and by whom.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>YOV have been told, if you remember, how <HI>Guillan,</HI> Duke of <HI>Bri&s;tow,</HI> and <HI>Angriote d' E&s;travaux,</HI> great Ma&s;ter of the Realm of Great <HI>Bri|tain,</HI> accompany'd by the Duke of <HI>Cornwal,</HI> and a great Number of War|riers, Knights, E&s;quires, and Soldiers, embarkt near <HI>London,</HI> and follow|ing the Command of the King their Ma&s;ter, made &s;trait towards <HI>Naples,</HI> where he was getting together a great Army, for to recover the State of the Empire, and revenge the Death of the murther'd Emperor, and his Son-in-law <HI>Dinerpius.</HI> They had a very fair wind for four days together: but on the fifth there aro&s;e &s;uch a Tempe&s;t, that there was left them neither Ma&s;t, Sail, nor Rope, they could make u&s;e of: So that, whether they would or no, they were driven on the Coa&s;t of <HI>Flanders,</HI> where they took Port, as well for the repairing of their Ve&s;&s;els, as to re&s;t them&s;elves a little after the Toil, they had &s;uffer'd.</P>
<P>Of which the Earl of <HI>Flanders</HI> having notice, and having a De&s;ire to &s;hew him&s;elf the Friend and good Ally of King <HI>Amadis,</HI> came to receive them, and &s;o per&s;waded them to enter into <HI>Germany,</HI> that they re&s;olv'd to go &s;trait to the City of <HI>Mentz,</HI> and take it by A&s;&s;ault, whil&s;t the Emperor was bu&s;ied in getting ready his Army to go again&s;t the Princes, a&s;&s;embled at <HI>Naples.</HI> So well did they execute their Re&s;olution, and kept them&s;elves &s;o &s;ecret and conceal'd, that they were as &s;oon at the Gates of the Town as they within had News of their De&s;ign. Neverthele&s;s the Alarm grew hot, and tho&s;e within found means to let down their Port-cullices, &s;o that the Re&s;i&s;tanc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter"> was &s;trong, and dangerous. But if the Defence was vigorous, the A&s;&s;ault was no le&s;s &s;o: for the &s;econd time the Knights of great <HI>Bri|tain,</HI> bowing down their Heads, break into their Enemies, of whom they made &s;uch a furious Slaughter, that few or none e&s;cap'd. Then they went to the Tower, where the Bodies of the Empero<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter"> and <HI>Dinerpius</HI> were hang|ing, which they carry'd ceremoniou&s;ly into the principal Church, and there burry'd them with great Magnificence. Then they &s;et the Empre&s;s at li|berty, and brought her very honourably to the Palace, where &s;he was acquain|ted with the Execution and Slaughter, made of the Traitors, at which &s;he was a little comforted, ince&s;&s;ently regretting the Deat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter"> of her Husband and Children, and the lo&s;s of her other Friends. But they a&s;&s;ur'd her <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 word">
<PB N="220" REF="117"> the Prince&s;s, her Sons Wife, and her Daughter, were with her Brother-in-law King <HI>Amadis:</HI> be&s;ides that GOD would not for&s;ake her, &s;eeing the good beginning of Victory, they had obtain'd. And becau&s;e they were advertis'd, that the Emperor was marching in great ha&s;t to meet King <HI>A|madis,</HI> and his Forces, they would not &s;tay above two days at <HI>Mentz,</HI> where they left a good Garri&s;on. And going &s;trait towards <HI>Con&s;tance,</HI> they had News of the Emperors Defeat the night before their coming, which gave them &s;uch a De&s;ire to vi&s;it their Friend<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">, that they got to them early the next day. Now the mo&s;t part of the Princes kept their Beds for &s;ome Wounds, they had receiv'd: but the coming of the&s;e Lords from Great <HI>Britain</HI> gave them &s;uch Ioy, that they were in a &s;hort time cur'd. The Empre&s;s al&s;o came thither, and was receiv'd by them all, as the Greatne&s;s of her Maje&s;ty requir'd, not without many tears &s;hed, and &s;everal Regrets of the Lo&s;s, &s;he had &s;uffer'd, which increas'd much more, when &s;he &s;aw her Daughter in-law <HI>Brifenna,</HI> whom <HI>Amadis</HI> and <HI>Candalin</HI> had recover'd out of the Pirates Hands, as you have been told. Thus &s;ome days pa&s;s'd, du|ring which the Kings provided for the mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary Affairs of the Em|pire, and <HI>Birmartes</HI> took leave of them, to fini&s;h his Enterpri&s;e, according to the Promi&s;e, he had &s;worn to <HI>Onoria,</HI> Daughter to the King of <HI>Apolonia.</HI> Wherefore we will in this place put an End to our Di&s;cour&s;e, lea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ing the Remainder to a Second Part, which we &s;hall &s;oon bring to light, if we re|ceive Encouragement by your favourable Acceptance of this.</P>
