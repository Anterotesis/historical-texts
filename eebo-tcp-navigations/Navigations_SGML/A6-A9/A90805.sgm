<HEAD>THE Policy of France, And the MAXIMS of <HI>LEWIS</HI> the XIV. Di&s;covered to all EUROPE.</HEAD>
<P>IT is not Birth which chiefly di&s;tingui&s;hes Princes from other Men, but their Parts and Abilities: How many of them find we in Hi&s;tory; who having but an indiffe|rent &s;hare of them, make no other figure, but to fill up Genealogy; and who&s;e Birth-days, and the days of their Death, are the only two which make any noi&s;e in the World. 'Tis according as this Spirit or Genius is di&s;po&s;ed in a Soveraign, that he acts for the good and welfare, or for the misfortune and undoing of his People. <HI>Wo to thee O Land,</HI> &s;aith the Wi&s;e Man, <HI>when thy King is a Child, and thy Princes eat in the Morning: Ble&s;&s;ed art thou, O Land,
<PB N="2" REF="3">when thy King is the Son of Nobles, and thy Princes eat in due &s;ea&s;on for Strength, and not for Drunkenne&s;s.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> Nation were happy under <HI>David</HI> and <HI>Solomon,</HI> but <HI>Rehoboam</HI> &s;poke to them in this manner, <HI>My little Fin|ger &s;hall be thicker than my Fathers Loyns; for whereas my Father put an heavy Yoak upon you, I will put more to your Yoak: My Father cha&s;ti&s;ed you with Whips, but I will cha&s;ti&s;e you with Scorpions.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Augu&s;tus Cae&s;ar</HI> was called <HI>Pater Patriae,</HI> Father of the People of <HI>Rome;</HI> but <HI>Nero</HI> their Hangman. <HI>Philip</HI> II. was born of a wi&s;e Father, who Reigned with general applau&s;e; but yet he was a Blood-thir&s;ty Man, who &s;pared not his own Blood, and &s;quandred away what <HI>Charles</HI> V. had pre|&s;erved with &s;o much Glory and Prudence. <HI>Francis</HI> the Fir&s;t was the Idol of the <HI>French,</HI> and Darling of the Nobility; he acquired the Title of a mild, gentle Prince in peace, Victorious in War, the Father and Re&s;torer of Learning and liberal Arts; but <HI>Charles</HI> IX. that of Murtherer.</P>
<P><HI>Henry</HI> IV. was &s;urnamed the Great, by rea&s;on of his great Actions, he was the Darling and Father of his People, and his beneficent &s;weet di&s;po&s;ition &s;eem'd to promi&s;e a happy Reign, if a cur&s;ed Hand had not put a &s;top to the cour&s;e of his Life. <HI>Lewis</HI> XIII. was &s;urnamed the Ju&s;t, grounded without doubt upon the Go&s;pel, which a&s;&s;ures us, <HI>That ble&s;&s;ed are the poor in Spirit, and that theirs is the King|dom of Heaven.</HI> It was rather <HI>Richlieu</HI>'s Spirit that reigned than his.</P>
<P><HI>Lewis</HI> XIV. did not di&s;cover his Inclinations whil&s;t he was under the Tuition of his Mother and <HI>Mazarines</HI> la&s;h, but &s;o &s;oon as ever this latter was dead, he &s;hewed what he was.</P>
<P>His Flatterers in imitation of his Grand father gave him the Name of <HI>Great,</HI> although he had not as yet de&s;erved it. 'Tis true indeed, He is Great, as to his Ambition, a great
<PB N="3" REF="3">U&s;urper of the Territories of his Neighbour, a great Ene|my to the Holy See, to the Pope, and a great Per&s;ecutor of the Hugonots, His Reign is full of nothing but great Mono|polyes, and his <HI>Louis d'ors</HI> are the only <HI>pa&s;&s;e par touts,</HI> or Keys that open the Gates to his Conque&s;ts. He was born Armed, and his fir&s;t nouri&s;hment was the Blood of his Nur|&s;es which he drew him&s;elf, that ambitious Spirit he is po&s;&s;e&s;t withall, would willingly &s;acrifice a good part of his Subjects to his Pa&s;&s;ion and Greatne&s;s: Wo be to thee O Land that groans under the burthen of &s;uch a Prince! Wo to that People en&s;laved under his Dominion! Under the Reign of <HI>Antiochus</HI> the Illu&s;trious, the <HI>Jews</HI> often cryed to God, that he would deliver them out of the hand of their Oppre&s;&s;or: Why may not the <HI>French</HI> put up the like Petition; nay, and all <HI>Europe</HI> be&s;ides to be delivered out of the hands of that U&s;urper. <HI>Lewis</HI> the Great thought he already held in his hand the Scepter of the Monarchy of all <HI>Europe,</HI> when <HI>Vi|enna</HI> was be&s;ieged; yea, he thought it within two hairs breadth of its de&s;truction, which he &s;uppo&s;ed inevitable, grounded upon the Prophe&s;ies of <HI>Drabitius;</HI> but perceiving this way &s;topt up, he betakes him&s;elf to his fir&s;t Errors and former Road, he waits with great impatience to &s;ee what the Snares which he lay'd at the time of the Queen of <HI>Spains</HI> Marriage, will produce: Man purpo&s;es, but God di&s;po&s;eth.</P>
<P>Time impairs the Mind as well as the Body, and Princes are oftentimes fain to let their Succe&s;&s;ors do what they were not able to do them&s;elves, and &s;o much the more, becau&s;e that &s;ame Divine Providence, on which Princes depend as well as the re&s;t of Mankind, doth not mete here below by the mea&s;ure of their Ambition: Ambitious Men build Ca|&s;tles in the Air, and by their good will would po&s;&s;e&s;s the whole Earth be&s;ide. This itch reigns at this day in <HI>France,</HI> and this is it which quite takes up the mind of <HI>Lewis</HI> XIV.

<P>HEretofore Men accu&s;ed <HI>Spain</HI> for a&s;piring to an Univer|&s;al Monarchy: If it was &s;o, I &s;uppo&s;e <HI>Philip</HI> II. begun to lo&s;e this hope, when he perceiv'd the Sea and Winds op|po&s;e his de&s;igns, and that the <HI>Armada,</HI> which he called In|vincible, (on Board of which he thought to have brought into <HI>Spain</HI> the <HI>Briti&s;h I&s;les,</HI> &amp;c.) came to nothing, and that his choice&s;t Troops who were embarqued therein, &s;erved only to fight again&s;t the Waves, and feed the Fi&s;hes of the Sea; moreover, when he &s;aw, that during the whole War of the <HI>Netherlands,</HI> (a &s;mall handful of People whom he called <HI>Gueux</HI> or Beggers, in deri&s;ion) were alwayes able to hold up their Head again&s;t him, nay, and to beat him in &s;e|veral Encounters, until &s;uch time as in the Year 1609, he was fain to cry Quarter, make a Truce with the <HI>&V;nited Provinces,</HI> and acknowledge them for Free States.</P>
<P>This was a very bitter Pill, and would &s;carce go down with a Prince who was &s;o highly ambitious: But it behoved him to &s;wallow it, and it wrought &s;o &s;trongly upon him, that he lo&s;t Seven Provinces at a clap by it, and part of the <HI>Indies:</HI> In&s;omuch, That this longing de&s;ire after the Univer&s;e began to abate by rea&s;on of his Age which had already lo&s;t the fir&s;t heat of Youth, and by rea&s;on of the bad &s;ucce&s;s of all his Enterprizes. <HI>Philip</HI> III. was as little fortunate as he, and <HI>Philip</HI> IV. had great di&s;appointments towards <HI>France</HI> and
<PB N="5" REF="4">the <HI>Low Countreyes</HI> and was very glad by clapping up a Peace to acknowledge tho&s;e who had been his Subjects for a Free and Soveraign Commonwealth, holding of none but God Almighty. <HI>Charles</HI> XI. Reigning at pre&s;ent is a good Prince, who loves his ea&s;e, and would willingly quit all the Claims and Titles of his Ance&s;tors to an Univer&s;al Mo|narchy for a Son and Heir to the Crown of <HI>Spain</HI> to &s;ucceed him. <HI>Malherbe</HI> told us long &s;ince, that if it were true, that <HI>Spain</HI> a&s;pir'd to an Univer&s;al Monarchy, he would advi&s;e his King to beg of God to prolong the World as much as he can. This Malady cea&s;ing in <HI>Spain,</HI> hath pa&s;&s;ed into <HI>France;</HI> but <HI>France</HI> being wi&s;er doth not gra&s;p &s;o much, and her King's Ambition is only confined to <HI>Europe,</HI> a wi&s;h worthy of &s;uch a great Prince; and who, if we con&s;ider him aright, could &s;carce demand le&s;s; his Neighbours ought narrowly to watch his water; for certain it is, <HI>France</HI> cannot aggran|dize her &s;elf without encroaching upon her neare&s;t Neigh|bours; as &s;he doth really every day already. When the Hou&s;e of <HI>Au&s;tria</HI> made broad &s;igns of her de&s;ign upon the Univer&s;e; all the Princes of Chri&s;tendom ro&s;e up again&s;t her, and entered into an A&s;&s;ociation to prevent her. <HI>Charles</HI> V. after the Battel of <HI>Pavia,</HI> where <HI>Francis</HI> was ta|ken Pri&s;oner; thought him&s;elf above all, but he found bu|&s;ine&s;s enough. The Pope, King of <HI>England,</HI> the <HI>Venetians,</HI> the Grand Duke of <HI>Tu&s;cany,</HI> the <HI>Swi&s;&s;e</HI> made a League again&s;t him, to hinder this Emperour from bringing <HI>France,</HI> and con&s;equently the re&s;t of <HI>Italy</HI> under his &s;ubjection. It was not for any kindne&s;s the Pope and King of <HI>England</HI> bore King <HI>Francis,</HI> that they combin'd together to relieve him, but becau&s;e <HI>Charles</HI> V. became &s;o great, that he would by his good Will have made him&s;elf Ma&s;ter of the World. Now at pre&s;ent, fora&s;much as this Itch is pa&s;t into <HI>France,</HI> All Princes of <HI>Europe</HI> for &s;ome time have run counter to
<PB N="6" REF="5">what&s;oever their Ance&s;tors did in the Reign of <HI>Charles</HI> V, and <HI>Philip</HI> II. and in&s;tead of oppo&s;ing they have abetted and concurr'd with the de&s;igns of <HI>France,</HI> &s;ome out of ba&s;e compliance, others out of fear. There are none but the Princes of <HI>Na&s;&s;au</HI> alone who have alwayes been fatal to who&s;oever had a mind to a&s;pire to this &s;ublime Monarchy of the Univer&s;e: Do not Men admire with me the wretched Policy of &s;everal Princes and States in the World, who look on with their Armes a cro&s;s, and behold the <HI>French</HI> King to advance &s;o fa&s;t, and take <HI>Luxemburg,</HI> a City of &s;uch grand Importance to <HI>Europe;</HI> only the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> pre&s;ented him&s;elf upon the breach with the <HI>Low Countreys</HI> but who not being in a capacity to do any thing by him|&s;elf, was forced to retreat: The <HI>French</HI> King would never have taken it, had <HI>England</HI> and the <HI>States,</HI> with&s;tood it, he hath no cau&s;e to brag of it; it is a truth all the World knows but too well; he was &s;o cunning to get the King of Great <HI>Britain</HI> on his &s;ide, that he con&s;ented to take what was not his own, and to baffle the re&s;t by illu&s;ory promi&s;es of an Univer&s;al Peace, after the taking in of <HI>Luxemburg,</HI> which they &s;uffered him to do; and this gro&s;s valiant Captain (of a Trencher-man) the Marque&s;s of <HI>Grana,</HI> Governour of the <HI>Low Countreys,</HI> who was not promoted to this place, but upon his demon&s;trating the means of being able to pre|&s;erve this mo&s;t Important place to the Court of <HI>Spain;</HI> a place, I &s;ay, &s;o nece&s;&s;ary to <HI>Spain</HI> for the pre&s;ervation of the <HI>Low Countreys</HI> by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of <HI>Germany;</HI> and albeit, he &s;hould have minded nothing el&s;e, but the pre&s;ervation of that &s;ame City, his own Honour, as well as Duty to, and intere&s;t of his King his Ma&s;ter, being all engaged therein: In&s;tead of doing which, this Fat-gut put into it only a piti|ful Garri&s;on of Twelve, or Fifteen Hundred Men, in&s;tead of Four Thou&s;and, and was wholly taken up in fortifying
<PB N="7" REF="5">the City of <HI>Namur</HI> with his Regiments, and &s;ome other pla|ces which were Cities <HI>on the boundaries</HI> which <HI>France</HI> would not have dared &s;o much as to touch: Would you not &s;wear &s;uch a Fellow con&s;pir'd to aggrandize <HI>France,</HI> and concurr'd with the De&s;igns of <HI>Lewis</HI> XIV. When the King in 1667 would have undertaken the Conque&s;t of the <HI>Spani&s;h Netherlands, England, Swedeland,</HI> and the <HI>&V;nited Provin|ces,</HI> a&s;&s;ociated together by the Triple League, forced him &s;oon to quit his hold; they obliged him to re-procure, and make a Peace with <HI>Spain;</HI> and to re&s;tore to it, &s;ome part of what he had u&s;urped and taken away. It would have been ju&s;t &s;o, if the Neighbouring Princes had done the &s;ame at &s;uch time as he attacked <HI>Luxemburg: Re&s;i&s;t the De|vil, and he will fly from you:</HI> But <HI>France</HI> cunning and &s;ubtle had &s;ufficiently tryed how prejudicial this League was to her; &s;he could never be at re&s;t till &s;he had pluckt this Thorn out of her Foot; and &s;o &s;oon as ever the term was expired, &s;he could not be &s;atisfied till &s;he had found out a way to hood|wink <HI>England,</HI> and &s;o got her di&s;ingaged from the Tripple-knot. The Dutche&s;s of <HI>Port&s;mouth</HI> like another <HI>Dalilah</HI> came over out of <HI>France</HI> into <HI>England,</HI> to lull a&s;leep the <HI>Samp&s;on</HI> of this Kingdom: <HI>France</HI> found out the way to act, and &s;peak &s;o fair, that &s;he hook't in <HI>Dunkirk</HI> by Promi&s;es and Money, at the beginning of the Reign of <HI>Charles</HI> II, King of <HI>Great Britain:</HI> A Town of &s;o great Con&s;equence to <HI>England,</HI> in as much as it affords a good entrance into <HI>Pi|cardy,</HI> and <HI>Flanders.</HI> 'Tis no new thing for <HI>France</HI> to be troubled with this itching mind to &s;ieze on the places of her Neighbours, and to enlarge her Dominion from one end of <HI>Europe</HI> to the other. The Duke of <HI>Rohan</HI> told us hereto|fore, that Princes commanded People; but that Self-Inte|re&s;t commanded Princes. (Without que&s;tion he would have added &s;omething el&s;e had he lived in this Age,) and e&s;pecially
<PB N="8" REF="6"><HI>Lewis</HI> the XIV. We may &s;ee Examples of it, day by day, and to &s;ecure his Ambition, all times and &s;ea&s;ons are good for him; in Peace, in War, in Ce&s;&s;ation of Arms. Intere&s;t is the evil Angel hath &s;o long reigned through <HI>France,</HI> we are taught out of Hi&s;tory, how <HI>Godfrey</HI> of <HI>Bulloign</HI> having a mind to take a Journey for the Conque&s;t of the <HI>Holy Land;</HI> and coming &s;hort of Money to put him&s;elf in a capacity to do it, &s;old many of his Cities and Lands; among&s;t others, the City of <HI>Metz</HI> with the Country adjoyning, which its own Citizens and Inhabitants purcha&s;ed of him for the Sum of an Hundred Thou&s;and Crowns. They enjoyed this their purcha&s;e till the Year of our Lord 1551, in which <HI>Charles</HI> V. did &s;o evilly intreat the Prote&s;tants of <HI>Germany. Henry</HI> II. King of <HI>France,</HI> under a pretence, &s;eemed forward to &s;end Relief to the &s;aid Prote&s;tants of <HI>Germany:</HI> In effect, he di&s;patched the Con&s;table of <HI>Monmorency</HI> with Four Thou&s;and Men, in all probability for this Expedition; but it was quite and clean for another de&s;ign, as the &s;equel will make appear: He demanded pa&s;&s;age of the City of <HI>Metz;</HI> who were for the mo&s;t part of the &s;ame Religion with tho&s;e who were mole&s;ted in <HI>Germany;</HI> between whom, and the Emperour, there was no good under&s;tanding: They gran|ted to the King with abundance of joy, what&s;oever he re|quired of them in reference to his Troops pa&s;&s;age; and in te&s;timony of their good will, they cau&s;ed Tables to be &s;et up in the Streets, to make the Soldiers eat and drink on their pa&s;&s;age, with huge demon&s;tration of Friend&s;hip and Rejoycing. But alas! Their Laughter was &s;oon changed into Weeping; &s;o &s;oon as ever the Con&s;table (who was re|ceived by the Magi&s;trates with all Tokens of Honour and Benevolence) had entered the City, he feigned him&s;elf to have a fit of the Gout, and to feel intolerable pains; he declared his great de&s;ire to have his Will made, not know|ing
<PB N="9" REF="6">what might befal him, in the War he was about to com|mence; and intreated the Magi&s;trates of the City, and all the Nobility that they would a&s;&s;i&s;t as Witne&s;&s;es of it. In the mean time he had given order to two Colonels to &s;ieze, one of them upon the Gate by which the Troops entered, and the other on that, by which they went out. To the fir&s;t, He gave order to cau&s;e part of the Army, which was &s;till without to advance; and to the other, to bid tho&s;e who were already gone out to enter in again: Now the Con&s;ta|ble &s;eeing the Magi&s;trates and chief Nobility round his Bed, expecting his Orders; up &s;tarts he like a Lyon enraged, and &s;heathed his Ponyard in the Mayors Brea&s;t, and at the Signal given, his Guards ru&s;ht in, and A&s;&s;a&s;&s;inated all the Nobi|lity they met with in his Chamber; whereupon the Army that had entered the City at the &s;ame time, cryed up and down the City, The Town is won: It was plundred, and &s;ubdued to the Bloody Dominion of the King, and of an Allie as it was, &s;oon became a Subject. This was the Bloody Conque&s;t of <HI>Henry</HI> II. And there is your <HI>French</HI> Policy.</P>
<P><HI>Lewis</HI> XIII. not knowing how to get po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of <HI>Lorain,</HI> by the Advice and Coun&s;el of that mo&s;t Subtle and Crafty Polititian Cardinal <HI>Richlieu,</HI> comes to <HI>Lions</HI> with an Army under pretence of &s;ome de&s;ign again&s;t <HI>Savoy.</HI> The <HI>Cardinal</HI> gave notice beforehand to Duke <HI>Charles</HI> of <HI>Lorrain,</HI> that he &s;hould make his per&s;onal appearance before the King, to pay him his re&s;pects, and a&s;&s;ure him by word of mouth of his good intentions towards his Per&s;on. This Duke thinking no harm, &s;uffered him&s;elf to be per&s;waded to it in earne&s;t, departs from <HI>Nancy</HI> to &s;alute the King at the head of his Troops: After he had complemented him, thinking he might return home again, he found it to be a Lions Den, arre&s;ted he was upon pretence of &s;ome old claims. His
<PB N="10" REF="7">Eminence at that time performing the Office of Mediator, propounded that to make his peace with the King, and that he might enjoy his Liberty, to put into the Kings hands <HI>Nancy</HI> his chief City, and the Key of his Dutchy: Thus far he mu&s;t go to be freed from his Arre&s;t: Well <HI>Nancy</HI> was de|livered up, the King entered into it like a Conquerour with his Army at his heels: Ob&s;erve the Policy of <HI>France</HI> in this particular.</P>
<P>The demoli&s;hing of the Ca&s;tle at <HI>Orange</HI> is ju&s;t &s;uch ano|ther trick, &s;hews their temper, for upon &s;ome little diffe|rence that aro&s;e between the two Prince&s;&s;es, Royal, and Dowager, <HI>Lewis</HI> XIV. King of <HI>France,</HI> as u&s;ually he doth, would intermeddle with it, and that he might make them agree, and that the young Prince (then under Age) avoid the Expences of maintaining a Garri&s;on there; he cau&s;ed the Ba&s;tions of the Ca&s;tle to be pull'd down, and left nothing but the Dungeon, which together with the Town he could take at plea&s;ure, as &s;ince he hath done. What the &s;ame King did at <HI>Strasburg</HI> is much the &s;ame: This City look't upon its &s;elf &s;ecure after the Treaty at <HI>Nemegen,</HI> con|firmed by the powerful Letters the King writ to them time after time, after the a&s;&s;urances his Re&s;ident then in the City gave them, that his Ma&s;ter de&s;ired nothing more than to live in a fair corre&s;pondence with the Emperour, and with the Cities of the Empire; la&s;t of all by the &s;uits and impor|tunities of the &s;ame Re&s;ident, a Traitor was Elected Burgo|ma&s;ter, who did nothing but by the Council of <HI>France.</HI> The Magi&s;tracy and Citizens thus lull'd a&s;leep by all the&s;e fair promi&s;es and prote&s;tations, di&s;mi&s;t the <HI>Swi&s;&s;es</HI> their Guards; but they were no &s;ooner without doors, but Mr. <HI>Louvois</HI> with a pui&s;&s;ant Army began to inve&s;t their City; obliges them to &s;urrender on what conditions &s;oever he thought fit to pre&s;cribe them; even at this pre&s;ent they
<PB N="11" REF="7">make no Con&s;cience to violate tho&s;e &s;orry Articles which were granted to them, and to mi&s;u&s;e them like Slaves, as he does all the re&s;t of his Subjects. Take notice of your Humour of <HI>France,</HI> which is always re&s;tle&s;s.</P>

<P>When <HI>Lewis</HI> XIV. &s;ent an Emba&s;&s;adour to the King of <HI>Siam,</HI> under the pretence of converting him, do you really believe this King endeavoured to extend his Mi&s;&s;ion &s;o far? No no, he works no Conver&s;ion, but where he may &s;end his Dragoons, who are his booted Apo&s;tles: It is to &s;pie the Country by his Je&s;uits, to endeavour by means of the Sieur <HI>Con&s;tance,</HI> a <HI>Venetian</HI> by Nation, and Chief Manager of that King's Affairs, to drive out other Nations, to &s;ettle &s;ome &s;ort of Commerce in that &s;ame Countrey; that he may
<PB N="12" REF="8">there have certain Emi&s;&s;aries, who may ever and anon put Jealou&s;ies into the King of <HI>Siam</HI>'s Head, by rea&s;on of the <HI>Hollanders</HI> growing Greatne&s;s in the <HI>Indies,</HI> to make the bu|&s;ine&s;s of <HI>Bantam</HI> &s;erve as a pretence, making another con|&s;truction of it. Ob&s;erve the Policy of <HI>France:</HI> She hath her politick tricks which &s;ucceed wondrous well: This is the rea&s;on why &s;he &s;ends none but notable Men into all the Courts of <HI>Europe,</HI> and &s;uch who are wonderful quick &s;igh|ted and ver&s;ed in Affairs; whom it's all one to her whe|ther &s;he fetch from the Camp, the Bar, or from the Church it &s;elf, as occa&s;ion &s;erves; according to the pla|ces wherein &s;he would have them imployed: But more e&s;pecially, it is requi&s;ite they &s;hould be dextrous and cun|ning, brazen-faced, that they have the knack of promi&s;ing fair; that they don't in&s;i&s;t too much upon certain petty &s;cruples, which hone&s;t men ought to have: In a word, to expre&s;s it more intelligibly, they mu&s;t be Cheats and Knaves; as for <HI>Spain,</HI> they mo&s;t an end &s;end thither one of the Cler|gy, by rea&s;on that every one knows, that per&s;ons of their Character have great credit there, and in con&s;iderable e&s;teem.</P>
<P>In <HI>England</HI> at &s;uch time as the Parliament were more po|werful than they be at pre&s;ent: Thither they &s;ent the Mar|qui&s;s <HI>De Rou'vigni,</HI> who was of the Reformed Religion, and their Delegate General at Court, and was of the very &s;ame temper that all the other Mini&s;ters are, and &s;waid by the &s;ame politick de&s;igns.</P>
<P>Into <HI>Holland</HI> they u&s;ually &s;end &s;ome well-&s;poken Man, who one would think would ruine his Ma&s;ter, by promi&s;ing, from which the King never gets off, but by &s;tanding to no|thing; who does what in him lies to in&s;inuate him&s;elf in|to the favour of your <HI>Dutch</HI> Ladies, either by play, or a libe|ral entertainment, and as they have a mighty influence upon
<PB N="13" REF="8">their Husbands temper and mind, they ca&s;t about to learn of them what they were not able to know from the Husband him&s;elf: Now &s;eeing they began to give no credit to him who re&s;ides there at pre&s;ent; the King, as him&s;elf confe&s;&s;eth in his de&s;tiny of Princes, was foret to &s;end him his Holy Spi|rit of <HI>France</HI> in all ha&s;te; &s;o that by this means he might be lookt upon as &s;incere and infallible in what&s;oever he &s;hould &s;ay.</P>
<P>To the Courts of <HI>Germany</HI> they di&s;patch your Brawny Fellows, who are able to bare Wine well; thereby, that they may be made fit Table Companions for the Prince, whither their Commi&s;&s;ion &s;ends them; for at the time when the third Cour&s;e comes up, when the Wine begins to ope|rate, they &s;peak divers things which they would not have divulged at another time: As &s;aith the Proverb, <HI>In vino veritas.</HI> Don't believe that <HI>France</HI> &s;ends a Church-man to <HI>Rome,</HI> and why? Becau&s;e they are all inferiour to the Pope, and there is not the pittifulle&s;t Prie&s;t, but is confident, he &s;hall be one day Cardinal; as Soldiers are, that they &s;hall one day be Captains. Thither is &s;ent a <HI>Nogaret,</HI> who bauls aloud; and to the Popes Infallibility, oppo&s;es the Power and Strength of his Ma&s;ter, the King.</P>
<P>Into other Courts, where greedine&s;s of Money prevails over their own Intere&s;t, there is not wanting pre&s;ents, and &s;uch a Prince there is, who is betrayed even to his Pillow.</P>
<P>In fine, All Weapons are convenient to this Policy of <HI>France,</HI> provided they can but bring about their De&s;ign: You &s;ee in all Courts <HI>Roman Catholick</HI> Officers, and all for &s;ooth, for having fought Duels; but retiring out of their Coun|try is not their chief bu&s;ine&s;s, that indeed is their pretence; but they have other aims and good in&s;tructions, and you &s;ee them after &s;ome time expir'd, return into <HI>France,</HI> to receive the reward of their employ; who bring along with them
<PB N="14" REF="9">information concerning the &s;trength or weakne&s;s of the places from whence they come, which in due &s;ea&s;on may be advantagious and u&s;eful to <HI>France;</HI> yet what is mo&s;t deplo|rable, is the blindne&s;s of &s;everal Princes to intru&s;t &s;uch like Men with Imployment, even among Prote&s;tants. Moun|&s;ieur <HI>Vauban</HI> the pre&s;ent chief Enginier of <HI>France</HI> followed this Trade particularly in <HI>Holland;</HI> 'tis confe&s;t, we mu&s;t &s;ay, he &s;erves his Ma&s;ter; but it behoves other Princes to have a &s;pecial care of him. You are in the right, you &s;ay true, and it were to be wi&s;ht all other Potentates would do the &s;ame for the quiet of <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P>Another Maxime of the Policy of <HI>France</HI> is, that when any Prince or Prince&s;s is to be Married, that may be for their turn, he cau&s;es Marriages to be propo&s;ed, and doth his utmo&s;t to place <HI>French</HI> Prince&s;&s;es in the Hou&s;es of Fo|reign Princes, whom they never fail to teach their Le&s;&s;on, and tell them it is their Duty, when time &s;erves; and be|fore their departure, to make them acknowledge how much they are obliged to the King; and the means whereby they may render him their acknowledgments: But yet it is of fre&s;h date, how the King of <HI>Portugal</HI> e&s;caped him; not but that the <HI>French</HI> King by his Mini&s;ters and Emi&s;&s;aries did what lay in hir power; and to his comfort, he neglected no|thing. <HI>Spain</HI> has been too hard for him at this time: At pre&s;ent the Policy of <HI>France</HI> is &s;et a work to match the Royal Prince of <HI>Poland</HI> no que&s;tion with &s;ome Natural Daughter of the Kings, &s;ince they have had the boldne&s;s to dare to pre&s;ent &s;uch an one to the Duke of <HI>Bavaria,</HI> who values him&s;elf as much, not to mention his Right to value him|&s;elf more than the Prince of <HI>Poland:</HI> Nay, I believe it had been a thing already done, had they but been &s;ure he would have &s;ucceeded to the Crown; for failing in that, he would have brought no great Advantage to <HI>France.</HI> 'Tis very
<PB N="15" REF="9">improbable the King of <HI>Poland</HI> would have refu&s;ed her with a con&s;iderable Dowry; for he is already much ob|liged to the King of <HI>France,</HI> Two Hundred Thou&s;and Li|vers a year be&s;towed on one of his Sons, by giving him the Abbies of St. <HI>Germain,</HI> and St. <HI>Dennis,</HI> de&s;erved well to be hearkned to: Be&s;ides, the Queen ought to be well &s;atisfied therewith; her Father is made Duke and Peer of France, and they have promi&s;ed to receive her as Queen, in ca&s;e &s;he comes into <HI>France,</HI> although &s;he be born Subject to the King of <HI>France:</HI> So that it is not at all to be que&s;tion'd, but that if the Crown were &s;ecured to the young Prince, the bu&s;ine&s;s would have been done e're now: There are Prin|ce&s;&s;es enough in <HI>France</HI> to be cho&s;en ready for this Match. Is it not to exalt him&s;elf, like the Chief Monarch of <HI>Europe</HI> to erect at <HI>Metz</HI> a Souveraign Court, before which the King makes all Kings and Princes be cited, who po&s;&s;e&s;s any Lands, whom he &s;tiles his Dependants for the Ter|ritories that no wayes belong to him; they upon default of appearing, not owning this Fal&s;e, Tyrannical, Univer&s;al Tribunal, he gets the Lands adjudged to him, takes po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of them without any form of Proce&s;s, but by his Cannon Law. If any one contradict this, the King of <HI>Sweden,</HI> the Princes of <HI>Monthelliard, Pettite Pierre</HI> the Duke of <HI>Lorrain,</HI> and a great many other Princes will tell you, what a Mon&s;ter this Chamber is, that it devours what&s;oever comes in its way; and what is yet more un|warrantable, is, that he dares ground his Right at this day to &s;ome Lands in <HI>Germany,</HI> upon the final determination this Chamber of <HI>Metz</HI> made in his behalf, as we &s;hall &s;hortly &s;ee in a Memorial he hath lately &s;ent to the Diet at <HI>Ratis|bone. France</HI> hath be&s;ides a notable Advantage to frame her Preten&s;ions and Titles: I mean, there are &s;o many cunning Fellows in <HI>Paris,</HI> knowing &s;o exactly to imitate the Ancient
<PB N="16" REF="10"><HI>Gothick</HI> Character of Five or Six Hundred Years date, that one would &s;wear they were in reality Authentick: Now by this means they hammer out a Dependance far fetcht, which the Devil him&s;elf, as cunning as he is, could not con|tradict: And then who knows what is &s;till behind the Curtain, and not come to light; which will not appear but in due time and place; when a favourable opportuni|ty &s;hall require it. Can a Man forbear laughing when he hears the prai&s;es which the&s;e flatterers be&s;tow on <HI>Lewis</HI> XIV. per&s;wading him he hath procured peace both to his Enemies and to all <HI>Europe.</HI> The&s;e Tales are very fit to be told to the Kingdom of <HI>Siam,</HI> as Moun&s;ieur <HI>de Chaumont,</HI> the <HI>French</HI> Emba&s;&s;ador was not backward to do in his Speech to that King, which is to be found at large in a Book Entituled, <HI>A Voyage into Siam;</HI> and they have not been wanting in like manner to put off &s;uch &s;ort of Trifles to the King of <HI>China;</HI> &s;uch like &s;tories, are good for nothing el&s;e but to be obtru|ded on tho&s;e Countreys, though not here in <HI>Europe,</HI> where our Eyes have &s;een, and Ears heard the contrary: Is it not &s;trange to meet with &s;uch Writers who commit &s;uch imper|tinent Trifles as the&s;e to paper? Don't we know what the proceedings of the King of <HI>France</HI> have been to procure a Peace with the States of the <HI>&V;nited Provinces?</HI> For &s;eeing Fortune began to change, he Agreed as touching the City of <HI>Nemeghen,</HI> which belonged to the <HI>Hollanders;</HI> &s;o that no body went to <HI>Ver&s;ailles,</HI> to demand it of him: He offers them <HI>Ma&s;tricht,</HI> which was &s;till in his hands: Yea, If the <HI>States</HI> had not been &s;o very ha&s;ty to grant him what he demanded, with &s;o much importunity, and for which he made &s;o many fair promi&s;es, he would have been glad to have defrayed all the Expence of the War: Pray who can tell what it hath co&s;t him under hand to obtain this Peace, which he &s;ued for with &s;o much in&s;tant Intreaties, &s;paring
<PB N="17" REF="10">nothing that he might endeavour to get the <HI>States</HI> to &s;lip their Necks out of the Collar, and for&s;ake their Allies; he went &s;o far as to &s;urrender divers places to <HI>Spain</HI> to &s;erve for boundaries between his Kingdom, and the <HI>&V;nited Pro|vinces.</HI> In &s;aying, that if the <HI>States</HI> had not been too forward to ha&s;ten on the &s;igning the Peace, <HI>France</HI> would have paid the Expences of the War. I hope I do not &s;peak without good grounds for what I &s;ay; &s;everal Rea&s;ons obliged them to clap up this peace in all ha&s;te &s;eparately, becau&s;e they &s;aw their &s;trength decrea&s;ed dayly: It is certain that after the Battle at St. <HI>Dennis,</HI> which was not fought out, by rea&s;on of a Peace, the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> would have marcht on into <HI>France</HI> with his Troops: Moreover the King knew full well, that being forced to agitate a General Peace, it would ne|ver be effected till he &s;hould &s;urrender to the Duke of <HI>Lorrain</HI> all his Lands; and that he could not po&s;&s;ibly induce the Elector of <HI>Brandenburg</HI> to re&s;tore to the <HI>Sweed,</HI> what he had taken from him according to his obligation thereto, when the Peace in particular with him was in agitation: <HI>France</HI> had a great mind to make him re&s;tore to the King of <HI>Sweden</HI> his Allie, what he had lo&s;t in taking up Arms for the &s;ervice of <HI>France;</HI> &s;o that here are your &s;ufficient rea&s;ons for demanding particular Peace with the <HI>States;</HI> and that it was not he that procured it for <HI>Europe,</HI> as he boa&s;ts and publi&s;heth up and down: If any one was the cau&s;e of Peace to the Empire, 'twas the <HI>States</HI> of the <HI>&V;nited Provinces;</HI> for when they had made peace at the in&s;tant &s;upplication of the King, the General Peace followed immediately, u&s;her'd in by the mediation of the <HI>States General:</HI> 'Tis mo&s;t certain, the King made this Peace by compul&s;ion; he began to do things, but by halves; the <HI>States</HI> and his Allies reinforced them&s;elves dayly. The <HI>Hollanders</HI> were recovered out of their Lethargie; the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> day by day became

<P>One of the King of <HI>France</HI> his Maxims, is to hinder the&s;e Neighbours, le&s;t they &s;hould augment their Forces, but re|main alwayes in a condition, not to be able to do them harm on the &s;udden, except they have a mind to have them about their Ears; as we have ob&s;erved at &s;uch time as the <HI>&V;nited Provinces</HI> were partly re&s;olved to levy Sixteen Thou&s;and Men; what Solicitations, what delu&s;ory Promi|&s;es, nay, how many Journeys did the Comte <HI>D' Avaux</HI> take to hinder it: He did nothing but talk up and down of the &s;incerity and reality of the Covenants on his part, ju&s;t as if no body be&s;ide his Ma&s;ter had any Hone&s;ty; and as if he were the only Man for keeping his word in Treaties: All that was, becau&s;e he &s;aw plainly that this new Com|mi&s;&s;ion given out, would ob&s;truct the taking the City of <HI>Luxemburg,</HI> promi&s;ing that there his Ma&s;ter would &s;top, and put an end to all his Claims and Demands: But he is &s;till as ready to take another, as he was before the taking of this City, as we &s;aw lately at <HI>Mons;</HI> it would be all one whe|ther the <HI>States</HI> &s;hould oppo&s;e this proceeding, or no; it would be &s;o long as the Princes of <HI>Europe</HI> &s;hould &s;uffer them|&s;elves to be hood-winkt by ba&s;e fear, or complai&s;ance, wonderful advantagious indeed to promote the de&s;igns of <HI>France</HI> in <HI>Europe;</HI> no body taking notice that <HI>France</HI> is as &s;ordid as her Ma&s;ter; and that both of them are afraid of cold Iron.</P>

<PB N="23" REF="13">love their Company: This change of &s;hapes procured him but ill will and di&s;dain; he had no &s;hare in the la&s;t promo|tion, nor never will &s;o long as <HI>Innocent</HI> XI. lives, nor per|haps after him; when of nece&s;&s;ity there will happen great changes at <HI>Rome:</HI> In the mean time Moun&s;ieur <HI>Camus,</HI> Bi|&s;hop of <HI>Grenoble</HI> (who&s;e unblameable Life and Conver&s;ati|on might &s;erve for a Mirrour to a many of your Court Bi|&s;hops) hath been honoured with the Purple without ever &s;eeking for it, without per&s;ecuting any body, nor &s;o much as &s;uffering it within his Dioce&s;s; this Prelate being not <HI>a-la-mode de la Court,</HI> this new Dignity he &s;o lately recei|ved, cannot choo&s;e but be a great heart-burning to the King, and greater to the Arch-bi&s;hop, to &s;ee him&s;elf &s;hut out of doors? La&s;t of all, Can a Man more vi&s;ibly cro&s;s the Popes behaviour, than the King doth at pre&s;ent in re&s;pect of the Franchi&s;es of his Emba&s;&s;ador's Quarters, which &s;erved only for a Sanctuary for Robbers, Bankrupts, and &s;everal A&s;&s;a&s;&s;inates; nay, more to fill the Emba&s;&s;ador's, or his me|nial Servants Pur&s;es? Although the Pope be Ma&s;ter in his own Hou&s;e, yet he hath had the prudence to expect the death of the Count <HI>De&s;trees,</HI> Emba&s;&s;adour; and the depar|ture of the Emba&s;&s;ador of <HI>Spain;</HI> yet what a clutter make they at the <HI>French</HI> Court about the regulation the Pope makes for &s;ecurity of his Subjects, and the quiet of his Ca|pital City? I would fain know if the Pope intermeddles with what the King doth at <HI>Paris,</HI> or whether he did think it convenient, to &s;peak again&s;t the Effigies of the King; which they have placed now in his Life-time, in the middle of Four Lanterns, in the place <HI>de Victor,</HI> with leud In&s;crip|tions, to which the Magi&s;tracy and Regiments of Guards did Obey&s;ance, and Honoured as the King him&s;elf, even &s;o far as to make Speeches to it. I would have any body &s;a|tisfie me how the King would have taken their bare re|mon&s;trances
<PB N="24" REF="14">of the Pope; without doubt he would have an&s;wered him, that he might meddle with his own bu&s;ine&s;s, and that every one is Ma&s;ter of his own. When his Holi|ne&s;s not approving the King's too familiar acquaintance with Madam <HI>de Monte&s;pan,</HI> and corre&s;pondence with Madam <HI>de Maintenon,</HI> when he &s;ignified to the General of the Je|&s;uits, that he was much &s;urprized, that Father <HI>La Chaize</HI> made no more of giving him ab&s;olution, the King appea|red to be very much di&s;&s;atisfied therewith; and &s;aid, he was bound to give an account to no body of his Acti|ons. Why did he cau&s;e his Emba&s;&s;ador to make his En|trance as it were, with Sword in hand: All this doth make the temper of <HI>France</HI> to appear, which would domineer eve|ry where over all, even over the Altar it &s;elf.</P>
<P>But let the King make what noi&s;e he will, as the&s;e Franchi|&s;es bring him no profit, &s;o there would be &s;ome way found out to pacifie all things, if his Holine&s;s would grant a Di|&s;pen&s;ation for a Marriage of the Elde&s;t Son of the Church to a Daughter of <HI>Rome,</HI> (I mean the City of <HI>Liege</HI>) I would &s;ay, by means of a Bull for the Cardinal of <HI>Fur&s;tenburg,</HI> in ca&s;e he could get him&s;elf elected Coadjutor to the Arch-bi|&s;hop of <HI>Cologne,</HI> not being in a capacity to be Arch-bi&s;hop of <HI>Cologne</HI> him&s;elf; to avoid falling under the &s;ame Circum|&s;tances that the afore&s;aid Arch-bi&s;hop did upon the account of the Bi&s;hoprick of <HI>Mun&s;ter,</HI> for which he never could ob|tain a Bull, how in&s;tant &s;oever the &s;olicitations have been by the late Emba&s;&s;ador of <HI>France</HI> for obtaining the &s;ame; but it is enough for the <HI>French</HI> King, &s;ince no body at pre&s;ent can be admitted to it; who is aver&s;e to his Intere&s;ts. Now if <HI>Fu&s;tenburg</HI> that <HI>Mercury</HI> of <HI>France</HI> &s;hould chance to be &s;o dignified, it is odds, but that the zeal for his Ma&s;ter and Benefactor would be augmented, and that nothing but this Temper and Policy of <HI>France</HI> would Reign, by rea&s;on

On the other hand, tho&s;e Bi&s;hops that a&s;pire to be Cardinals, would not be well plea&s;ed with this new invention, except the Arch-bi&s;hop of <HI>Paris,</HI> who could have &s;ome pretence to this Dignity; who in plain terms doth already &s;ay, That the Kings of <HI>England,</HI> &s;ince <HI>Henry</HI> VIII, till <HI>Charles</HI> II. have done well enough without <HI>Rome;</HI> be&s;ides, what the Northern Kings do at this time.

When <HI>France</HI> carried on a de&s;ign under-hand to in|duce the Emperour to be&s;tow his two Si&s;ters upon two Prin|ces di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;t of their Inheritance; it was not with an in|tent that bu&s;ine&s;&s;es &s;hould &s;ucceed in this manner as we &s;ee they do at this day; for we cannot deny but that <HI>Lorrain</HI> is the Re&s;torer of the Empire, an <HI>Hero</HI> of &s;o many Great and Glorious Victories, the Subduer of &s;o many Provinces, who will make the Grand Seigniour not only &s;ue to him for Peace, as he doth already, but to grant what&s;oever one demands of him to &s;ave his Head from the riot and fury of the Rabble, who will be &s;ure to do it, if he conclude not a Peace, or a Ce&s;&s;ation of Arms, and that &s;peedily. But this Spirit of <HI>France</HI> had its aims; that is to &s;ay, by getting &s;ome body to coun&s;el the Emperour to be&s;tow his two Si&s;ters on two Princes in the forementioned Circum&s;tances, who de|&s;paired of recovering their E&s;tates but by a Peace; they would alwayes incline the Emperour to li&s;ten thereto, not|with&s;tanding his Imperial Maje&s;ty might not have that ad|vantage by it that might be expected; in hopes there might be &s;ome Article in it favourable to them, re&s;toring them to their E&s;tates by this Peace. The truth is, that hath been

Af|ter the Death of <HI>Ferdinand</HI> III. did not the <HI>French</HI> King u&s;e his utmo&s;t endeavours to re-a&s;cend the Throne of <HI>Charle|main;</HI> he &s;pared not to &s;end into all the Courts of the Ele|ctors to procure their Votes; and &s;uch who were great with the&s;e Princes, did their bu&s;ine&s;s for them; for <HI>France</HI> is free-natur'd enough, when any one is to be brought over to their Party: One of the vi&s;ible demon&s;trations of the Kings de&s;igns is, that he cau&s;ed an Eagle to be put upon his
<PB N="34" REF="19">Money ju&s;t above the Head of his Effigies; and that he &s;peaks his mind freely, but much more haughtily, that the Empire hath been long enough in the Hou&s;e of <HI>Au&s;tria,</HI> and that it is high time it &s;hould return to his again; and that was ju&s;t upon the <HI>Turks</HI> coming into <HI>Germany,</HI> in the year 1683. But Man purpo&s;eth, God di&s;po&s;eth: All the wi&s;e projects and contrivances of Men are but folly before God, who doth not guide the Oeconomy of the Univer&s;e accor|ding to the ambition of <HI>Lewis</HI> the Great: Now becau&s;e this King knows very well that the Electors may prove a great ob&s;tacle to his de&s;ign upon the Empire if they have a mind to be cro&s;s; therefore he makes much of &s;ome, threatens others. The <HI>Dolphin</HI> of <HI>Frances</HI> Marriage concluded with the Prince&s;s of <HI>Bavaria,</HI> was a bait to draw in the Prince of that Family to the King's Intere&s;t, and &s;o in&s;pire his Body with a <HI>French</HI> Spirit: That Pen&s;ion the King allowed him for &s;ome time made him much in the Kings Books, and devoted to his Intere&s;t; nay, over and above the Marriage every one was in the mind that this Prince would be perpetually devoted to his Benefactor; but the unbecoming unworthy Matches that <HI>France</HI> offered this Prince, made his Mini&s;ters look about them; who knew &s;o well how to di&s;abu&s;e him, that he alter'd his mind, and tack't about to the better and more glorious &s;ide, whether we con&s;ider it in re&s;pect of the Marriage he contracted with the Emperours Daughter, or by the Lawrels he won in <HI>Hungary.</HI> This is a thing he dur&s;t not &s;o much as have dreamt of, if he had remained in the <HI>French</HI> Intere&s;t; becau&s;e the Conque&s;ts of the Imperial Army did not at all corre&s;pond with the Kings de&s;igns, as we told you before: No &s;ooner had Moun&s;ieur <HI>Baviere</HI> for|&s;aken the <HI>French</HI> Party, but the King to comfort him&s;elf up for that lo&s;s, entering <HI>Madam la Dauphines</HI> Chamber, told her that he ju&s;t came from winning Eight Hundred Thou|&s;and
<PB N="35" REF="19">Crowns of her Brother. We all know how the Ele|ctor of <HI>Brandenburg</HI> is be&s;et on all &s;ides with the Emi&s;&s;aries of <HI>France,</HI> and how the chief per&s;ons of his Court, which di&s;cretion makes me forbear mentioning, have taken but too large a Do&s;e of that &s;ame <HI>Spirit Gall;</HI> &s;o that there is nothing tran&s;acted in the Electors Court, but the <HI>French</HI> Envoy hath pre&s;ently notice of it, and by Moun&s;ieur <HI>de Rebenack</HI>'s good leave, Men are &s;ufficiently informed of all his Intrigues, of all the Pre&s;ents he be&s;tows; if it were le&s;s &s;ecret, one might not perchance know it; but he wanting the retentive faculty to keep his own Coun&s;el, he mu&s;t give others leave to di&s;clo&s;e it, who are not &s;o much concern'd to keep a &s;ecret. If the late Prince <HI>Lewis</HI> had been &s;urer to the <HI>French</HI> Intere&s;t than he was, perhaps he might have been alive to this day: Well, I know the <HI>French</HI> Envoy had not an hand in the fact, but did &s;ugge&s;t and promote it: I know that the Prince Elector is not ignorant neither, whence the Di&s;temper proceeds; he hath rea&s;on to coun|termine them, and &s;tand upon his Guard; but I could wi&s;h, he may not be too &s;low, and that he &s;hut not the Stable door when the Hor&s;e is &s;toln. If &s;o be the Elector of <HI>Bran|denburg</HI> had an in&s;ight into his real true Intere&s;t and Forces; could but get rid once of the&s;e <HI>French</HI> Spirits that encom|pa&s;s her; he might &s;afely &s;ay he was one of the mo&s;t pu|i&s;&s;ant Princes of the North, make others dread and &s;tand in awe of him: Be &s;ure which way &s;oever he takes, he ca&s;ts the &s;cales, <HI>France</HI> knows it very well too, and that's the rea&s;on why they court him &s;o much: Let him but &s;tand Neuter, and e&s;pou&s;e no Cau&s;e, &s;he is &s;atisfied. The Per|&s;ecution of the Prote&s;tants of <HI>France</HI> had in a manner open|ed the eyes of the Elector; yet Moun&s;ieur <HI>de Rebenack,</HI> backt by Moun&s;ieur <HI>D'e&s;pen&s;e,</HI> managed things &s;o finely, that people gave more credit to what they &s;aid, than to &s;o

<P>As for the Elector <HI>Palatine</HI> of the <HI>Rhine,</HI> when <HI>France</HI> mediated a match between the Prince&s;s, and the Duke of <HI>Orleans;</HI> &s;he had two things in her eye; the fir&s;t was there|by together with a Pen&s;ion to allure the late Prince Elector into her Intere&s;ts; not being able to do that, he might evermore devi&s;e preten&s;ions for the Right of Madam of <HI>Orleans.</HI></P>
<P>After that we know but too well how the Electors <HI>Pala|tines</HI> Father and Son were treated by <HI>Lewis</HI> XIV. how the <HI>Palatinate</HI> hath been trodden under foot by his Troops and the people of that Country ruin'd and laid wa&s;te: But la&s;t of all Death having deprived the World of the&s;e two Princes in a &s;hort time without Male I&s;&s;ue; and &s;eeing that at pre&s;ent the <HI>Palatinate</HI> is fallen to the Hou&s;e of <HI>Newburg,</HI> (pur&s;uant to a Treaty with the Emperour to that purpo&s;e) the King of <HI>France</HI> is per&s;waded there is no other re&s;olution to take with the Elector now Reigning, that he is too near an Allie to the Emperour (to whom he is beholden for what he hath) ever to abandon his Intere&s;ts, or quit his Party; &s;o that it is not thereabouts neither, that <HI>France</HI> attacks it, the preten&s;es of Madams Rights are now in debate: The

All the Elector mu&s;t wi&s;h for is, that Peace may be concluded between the two Emperours this Winter, that the Death of a Prince hapning, his &s;ucce&s;s may afford work enough to <HI>Lewis</HI> the Great &s;omewhere el&s;e: Now the&s;e &s;eem to be the only means how this Elector may avoid falling into the clutches of <HI>France;</HI> and this rea&s;on ought much to &s;way with the Emperour, and be a principal mo|tive to him to make a Peace with the <HI>Turk,</HI> as he may now do very advantagiou&s;ly: For he mu&s;t know, that if ever the <HI>French</HI> King break the Ice, and gets footing in <HI>Germany;</HI> he will never return back: The <HI>French</HI> are very in&s;olent and domineering, e&s;pecially at the fir&s;t heat, and in pro&s;pe|rity; and provided Fortune &s;miles upon them at the begin|ning, and in their fir&s;t furie; wherewith they undertake all Exploits, that is a great incitement to them to drive on farther and farther, and then peace with the <HI>Turk</HI> not being made, I cannot tell whether the Emperour will be ever able to make it, if he would never &s;o fain, at le&s;t upon the &s;ame Terms and Conditions they offer him at this time.</P>
<P>The Elector of <HI>Saxony</HI> never made much account of all the propo&s;als of <HI>France:</HI> He is a Prince that doth not &s;tu|dy all tho&s;e cunning niceties and tricks that a great many other Courts are full of, but one who being well ver&s;t in what is good for him&s;elf, pur&s;ues it, without di&s;puting, or making more ado: Now that's your be&s;t Policy which &s;uc|ceeds the be&s;t; wherefore <HI>France</HI> &s;eeing he would not &s;wal|low the hook, breeds abundance of trouble in his Family,
<PB N="38" REF="21">and &s;ets him at variance with his Neighbours, again&s;t which the Emperours Council hath made &s;ea&s;onable provi&s;ion, which makes the Spirit of <HI>France</HI> that it becomes not &s;o fami|liar in that Court, for their <HI>Ducatoons</HI> are better beloved than <HI>Lewi&s;&s;es:</HI> But to know what it done there, thither is &s;ent &s;uch Per&s;ons who have skill to comply and conform to the humour of the Country, and more e&s;pecially to quaff &s;tout|ly, and by that means render them&s;elves fit Companions at Table; they mu&s;t be of &s;trong Con&s;titution to bear Wine; there they may get acquaintance, make them&s;elves familiar, and make bold to skip their Gla&s;&s;es. So likewi&s;e at the <HI>French</HI> Court, when an Envoy or Re&s;ident is to be &s;ent to the Court of <HI>Saxony;</HI> they inquire in the fir&s;t place whe|ther he can hold out well at drinking, that's one Qualifica|tion, together with couzening, that is requi&s;ite.</P>
<P>As for the Electors of <HI>Triers</HI> and <HI>Metz,</HI> as <HI>France</HI> are not afraid of them, as not being Princes that are capable of doing much mi&s;chief, &s;o they let them alone till time &s;erves; for &s;he knows that &s;tanding in need of them, &s;he will be able to attract them by the &s;weet charmes of her golden rayes; if not, &s;he will proceed to threatnings, and thereby make her do what &s;he plea&s;es. The King needs no more but &s;end his Forces to <HI>Triers,</HI> he hath reduc't it to &s;uch a condition as not to be in a capacity to di&s;pute his entrance, and &s;o he can make him&s;elf Ma&s;ter of it, when he thinks fit.</P>
<P>As for the Elector of <HI>Cologne,</HI> we all know what mettle he is made of; that he's a Prince that loves a quiet Life, and de&s;iring to end his dayes in peace; gives him&s;elf wholly up to his Devotions, to work out his Salvation; this de&s;ign being alwayes commendable in a Prelate, and a Per&s;on of his Character. But a mild peaceable di&s;po&s;ition doth no wayes agree with that of <HI>France,</HI> which is turbulent, boy|&s;terous,
<PB N="39" REF="21">and would alwayes be in action: Now here is the rea&s;on why they have given the Arch-bi&s;hop a chip of the old block, who hath a good &s;tock of the <HI>French</HI> Spirit: I mean the Cardinal Bi&s;hop of <HI>Strasbourg,</HI> who is as vio|lent, and as great a cheat, as he that animates him; neverthele&s;s this Bi&s;hop hath got the art &s;o well, to influence the mind of the Arch-bi&s;hop, that he rules him with an ab&s;olute &s;way, and by means of the Bi&s;hoprick of <HI>Mun&s;ter,</HI> which <HI>France</HI> procured him with Two Millions of Crowns, cannot hand&s;omly turn tail at pre&s;ent. I know the Pope upon very ju&s;t con&s;iderations hath not been wil|ling to di&s;patch the Bull hitherto; yet it is enough for <HI>France,</HI> that by this Election, during the Electors Life; the Chapter dare never let it enter into their thoughts, much le&s;s &s;upply the place; &s;o that <HI>France</HI> is &s;ure that no one Prelate of a contrary party, &s;hall ever be admitted to that dignity, and that &s;ufficeth. How many Bi&s;hops are there in <HI>France</HI> without Bulls, who notwith&s;tanding perform the Functions of their place, and enjoy the benefits of their Bi&s;hopricks. The Pope cannot live for ever, and the King will be &s;ure to keep the Gate open, and High-wayes clear; that after the Arch-bi&s;hops decea&s;e, &s;ome other Emi&s;&s;ary of <HI>France</HI> may come in at the &s;ame Golden Gate: This Bi&s;hoprick being of great con&s;equence as him&s;elf did acknowledge it to be in the year 1672. I told you that the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Cologne</HI> would have much ado to free him&s;elf from the <HI>French</HI> Intere&s;t, the King having taken care for that beforehand, in ca&s;e of a change; and all that was done at <HI>Liege,</HI> was but a cunning &s;tratagem, and that through the &s;ugge&s;tion of that Prince, to foment mi&s;-under&s;tanding between them, and to &s;et be|fore the Citizens of <HI>Liege</HI> the Idea of their di&s;content, by rea|&s;on of the Cittadel which they have again rai&s;ed, whereof <HI>France</HI> is too much a Ma&s;ter, that will occa&s;ion the Arch-bi|&s;hop
<PB N="40" REF="22">of <HI>Cologns</HI> Repentance, at lea&s;t that of his Succe&s;&s;or after him, in ca&s;e they begin to waver: Men were in &s;u&s;|pen&s;e at that time concerning who &s;hould &s;ucceed him; for <HI>France</HI> &s;aw at a di&s;tance, and &s;he &s;uppo&s;ed by all that had pa&s;t, that &s;he might be able to prevail with the Chapter of <HI>Liege,</HI> to confer the Coadjutor&s;hip of the Principality and Bi&s;hoprick of <HI>Liege</HI> upon Cardinal <HI>Fur&s;tenburg;</HI> but tho&s;e that compo&s;ed the Chapter better advi&s;ed than any one dur&s;t have believed or hoped for, had no mind to &s;wallow the bait, but laught at it, which made him have recour&s;e to the Chapter of <HI>Cologne,</HI> where he hath had better &s;ucce&s;s, and notwith&s;tanding all the oppo&s;ition the Pope and Em|perour made; they went farther, and the Cardinal hath obtained what <HI>France</HI> demanded: They have been long about this bu&s;ine&s;s, and immediately upon Mens &s;aying, That the Cannons knew what Gold was. <HI>France</HI> progno|&s;ticated nothing but good to her &s;elf, and found the Road to <HI>Cologne</HI> ea&s;ier than to <HI>Mun&s;ter.</HI></P>
<P><HI>France</HI> and the Cardinal know very well that the Pope will not give his Bull for it; but they may have the &s;ame comfort in that as they had for <HI>Mun&s;ter,</HI> they will do well enough without it, no body be&s;ides being capable of pre|tending to it; and as I told you the Pope being aged, may chance to dye, and another more ea&s;ie Man may &s;ucceed him.</P>
<P>Now then by what we &s;ee come to pa&s;s by the procee|dings of the Policy of <HI>France:</HI> Have I not great rea&s;on to &s;ay that the whole Empire, Electors, and other Kings, Princes, and States have great cau&s;e to with|&s;tand the de&s;igns of <HI>Leuis</HI> XIV. to prevent his ri&s;ing to an Empire for fear of becoming his Slaves, whereas at pre&s;ent he takes &s;pecial care of &s;ome, and care&s;&s;es them; he will then Lord it over them, he will put off the Foxes skin, and
<PB N="41" REF="22">put on the Lyons again; they'l talk of nothing then, but of <HI>tel e&s;t mon bon plai&s;ir,</HI> &s;uch my Will and Plea&s;ure is. Nothing but a Peace with the <HI>Turk</HI> can hinder him from growing Great; nothing but that can put the Emperour in a condition to oppo&s;e it. The King will be very cautious how he makes his limits at <HI>Ratisbon,</HI> during the&s;e Conte&s;ts that give him an opportunity to build Fortre&s;&s;es, to defend what he &s;hall u&s;urp; as we &s;ee he hath done but too much already: It will be requi&s;ite to have an Army to drive him out thence. Have not we &s;een in the time of peace what the Spirit of <HI>France</HI> is capable of doing: 'Tis known, that among&s;t other good qualities, he is indued with the admi|rable gift of U&s;urping well, finds always rea&s;ons for the doing &s;o; which he would have all Men receive for Articles of their Creed, as well as the ju&s;t pretentions of the King upon the Empire, treated at large in a little Book, wherein the Wit of one called <HI>Aubri</HI> (Advocate in the Parliament of <HI>Paris</HI>) hath been exerci&s;ed? But the King of <HI>France</HI> his Manife&s;to publi&s;hed newly at <HI>Ratis|bone</HI> and other States of the Empire, to maintain the U&s;ur|ping Fortification of <HI>Tarbrack,</HI> de&s;erves to be in&s;erted in this Book, to let the&s;e who have not yet &s;een it, under&s;tand the &s;lender Rea&s;ons he alledges to palliate his infraction of the la&s;t Truce. Behold here what his Mini&s;ter hath-publi&s;hed to all the World.</P>
<P><Q REND="margQuotes">The King having been informed of the complaints which the Mini&s;ters of the Hou&s;e of <HI>Au&s;tria</HI> make upon the account of &s;ome outrages committed at <HI>Tarbrack</HI> by his Maje&s;ties Order, who throughout the Empire they charge with acting contrary, and call him an infringer of the Treaty concluded in the Year of our Lord, 1684.</Q> The which hath obliged his &s;aid Maje&s;ty to i&s;&s;ue out Or|ders to the Count <HI>de Crecy,</HI> his Envoy Extraordinary, and
<PB N="42" REF="23">Plenipotentiary at the Imperial Diet at <HI>Ratisbone,</HI> to repre|&s;ent to the Mini&s;ters of the Electors, Princes, and States of the Empire a&s;&s;embled in the &s;aid place, the &s;mall ground there is for &s;uch a complaint in it &s;elf, and the ju&s;t occa&s;ions they admini&s;ter to all tho&s;e who have a de&s;ire to pre&s;erve the publick peace; to believe that this is a pretence that they are willing to make u&s;e of to di&s;turb the &s;ame peace and quiet.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t of all, If it may be &s;aid upon good grounds that that Treaty ratified at <GAP DESC="blank"> may not properly be called a Truce, its true definition being only a forbearance or &s;ufferance, by vertue of which (although the War be &s;till in being) we are to forbear all Acts of Ho&s;tility; there being at that time no rupture between <HI>France</HI> and the Em|pire; this tolleration may be lookt upon as a mutual promi&s;e of a good under&s;tanding and Union for the &s;pace of Twen|ty years; in con&s;ideration whereof the Emperour and Em|pire on the one part, are to lay a&s;ide, during the &s;aid term, their Soveraignty, Rights, Superiority, and Protection, or all other pretences what&s;oever they may have upon Lands, Places, or Towns fallen to <HI>France</HI> before the fir&s;t of <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> 1681. His Maje&s;ty in like manner binds him&s;elf not to make any farther &s;uit or pro&s;ecution in the Empire during the &s;aid time. The&s;e are the mo&s;t material Covenants, by which they interchangeably a&s;&s;ure each other of a long continua|tion of Friend&s;hip and good Intelligence; which afforded means to the Emperours Arme is to conquer all <HI>Hungary,</HI> and to put them&s;elves and Empire in a po&s;ture, and in a condi|tion to undertake a War, which otherwi&s;e would not have waged but at great co&s;t and charges; and peradventure at the hazard and ruine of the Electors, Princes, and States of the Empire. But further to demon&s;trate this weak pre|text, altogether not to be tenible, nor can hold Water of
<PB N="43" REF="23">it &s;elf, we need not run over the Articles of this Treaty, and though we might even look upon it as a Treaty barely con|cluded only for the &s;ecurity of the tranquillity of the Em|pire, and to procure for it the means whereby to imploy its Armies again&s;t the common Enemy; yet one cannot for all that prove that it may deprive the King of his Power to fortifie tho&s;e places where his Maje&s;ty hath right &s;o to do, as well by the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion he hath already had, as by the com|mon con&s;ent of the Empire, granted by vertue of the &s;ame Treaty, nor that he cannot act in tho&s;e places as he plea|&s;eth; you need only peru&s;e all the Treaties of Truce which have been made hitherto, to &s;ee whether a prohibition of fortifying is not expre&s;ly included therein at &s;uch time as both Parties cannot agree. By this toleration of the Truce of <HI>Bonvi&s;e</HI> in the year of our Lord 1537, 'tis &s;aid, that whil&s;t the Ce&s;&s;ation of Arms la&s;ts in the <HI>Netherlands,</HI> King <HI>Francis</HI> I. could not &s;end any Forces into the County of St. <HI>Paul,</HI> nor there rai&s;e any Fortification: This Excepti|on gives us &s;ufficiently to under&s;tand, that the King was impowered to fortifie his places thereabouts, and el&s;e|where, during the &s;aid Truce; &s;o that they were bound to in&s;ert a clau&s;e into this Treaty, to deprive <HI>France</HI> of this Liberty in the County of St. <HI>Paul</HI> only.</P>
<P>The General Truce that was agreed upon at <HI>Nice,</HI> in the Year 1538, ratifies and confirms this &s;ame Article concer|ning St. <HI>Paul,</HI> but it doth no way hinder the two Princes to cau&s;e Fortifications to be rai&s;ed any where el&s;e.</P>
<P>The Ce&s;&s;ation made in 1555, makes no mention of this point, but the Crown of <HI>Spain,</HI> and <HI>States General</HI> of the <HI>&V;nited Netherlands</HI> upon their concluding a Truce in 1609, having a mind indeed to deprive each other of having the liberty of rai&s;ing any new Fortre&s;s in the <HI>Low Countreys,</HI> in&s;erted this Clau&s;e; <HI>There &s;hall be on neither &s;ide any

<P>When the Peace was in agitation at <HI>Mun&s;ter</HI> between <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Spain,</HI> that they demurr'd longe&s;t upon and proved the greate&s;t ob&s;tacle to the conclu&s;ion, was, that the Catholick King could not find in his heart to quit his claim to <HI>Catalonia,</HI> which cau&s;ed them to agree upon a Truce for Thirty years for that Province alone; during which term both Kings &s;hould keep what he po&s;&s;e&s;t at that time; but another difficulty emerg'd that the <HI>Spaniards</HI> could not endure that they &s;hould fortifie during the Truce; tho&s;e places in <HI>Catalonia,</HI> to which the <HI>French</HI> would not agree, alledging it unju&s;t, upon this account that thereby this would put them in a po&s;ture of being Defendants only, and not Aggre&s;&s;ors, which was permitted in all Ages, they would not &s;o much as admit of the Expedient offered by the Em|ba&s;&s;ador of the <HI>States General.</HI> The &s;ame ca&s;e &s;tands good now, as to the pre&s;ent Treaty. Every one knows that the prohibitions to rai&s;e Fortifications propounded by the Mini|&s;ters of the Empire, in the Ninth and Tenth Articles of the &s;ame project of the Empire, and what was then and there in|terchangeably delivered by publick Writing, was interjected by <HI>France:</HI> Be&s;ides, the Imperial Mini&s;ters would by no means give their con&s;ent that the Emperour &s;hould yield up to the King &s;uch places whereof he was in pre&s;ent po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, which his Maje&s;ty would not have medled with, nor limi|ted, nor encroached upon. The Emperours Mini&s;ters not able to make good this demand, gave it over. 'Tis hard to believe that the Imperial Mini&s;ters will draw any Argu|ments to be a &s;ufficient ground of complaint from the Eighth and Ninth Article of the Truce; fora&s;much as the former contains only the &s;ettling the Lands upon the Proprietors again, who would take the Oath of Allegiance for them: The Soveraignty whereof was delivered to his Maje&s;ty.

<P>Notwith&s;tanding all this, con&s;idering that this Truce hath offered to Chri&s;tendom that happy Peace and Tranquillity it enjoys at this day; and hath &s;upplyed means to the States and Circles of the Empire by their a&s;&s;i&s;tance to bring upon the <HI>Ottoman</HI> Empire all tho&s;e mi&s;chiefs wherewith they threatned the Hereditary Countreys.

Until <HI>Philip</HI> IV. time, <HI>Spain</HI> ever kept up its head, (though it began to decline in <HI>Philip</HI> the Seconds, by rea&s;on of the War in the <HI>Low Countreys</HI>) but ever &s;ince that, and particu|larly after the la&s;t King <HI>Philip</HI> IV. Death, <HI>France</HI> got the upper hand, and <HI>Spain</HI> humbly &s;ubmitted.</P>
<P>Upon the Fe&s;tival of one of the Kings of <HI>Spain</HI> who was Sainted, the Preacher St. <HI>Ferdinand</HI> extolling the grandeur of his Mighty King in his Sermon, told 'em, that if his God was not God, the King <HI>Don Philip</HI> &s;hould be God; but I &s;uppo&s;e &s;omething le&s;s than &s;o, would &s;atisfie his Succe&s;&s;or, the ca&s;e being altered &s;ince that.

<P>If <HI>Spain</HI> were not &s;upported by its Allies, <HI>Lewis</HI> XIV.

<P>To let you &s;ee how much <HI>Spain</HI> &s;uffers it &s;elf to be <HI>baffled</HI> by <HI>France,</HI> I need only &s;hew you two Examples, which will convince you that I have &s;aid nothing but what is true. The King of <HI>France</HI> &s;ent a Memorial to the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> and to the States of the United Provinces, to this effect: That if the King of <HI>Spain</HI> &s;hould grant the <HI>Low Countreys</HI> to the Duke of <HI>Bavaria,</HI> or but make him Governour (as the report was when he married the Arch-dutche&s;s) that &s;he would then without more ado break off the peace, &s;ince neither of tho&s;e things could be done without manife&s;t in|jury to the Dauphin's Right. Mr. <HI>Feuquier</HI> was the Man who gave the Memorial to the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> and Count <HI>D'avaux</HI> to the <HI>&V;nited Provinces;</HI> but were <HI>Paris</HI> over this, perhaps you'l &s;ay, that <HI>Spain</HI> did not con&s;ider it well, and they are &s;o ju&s;tly afraid of <HI>France,</HI> that it is no wonder if that puts 'em a little out of their Wits: But I am going to tell you a thing, which you'l own does &s;ufficiently di&s;cover the weakne&s;s and poor Spirit of <HI>Spain;</HI> it hapned at the Ceremony of making an Entry into <HI>London,</HI> that the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> and <HI>French</HI> Emba&s;&s;adors met: The Baron <HI>Watville</HI> went be|fore <HI>Moun&s;ieur d' E&s;trade, France</HI> pre&s;ently complains of this indignity; and <HI>Spain</HI> was &s;o pitifully mean, as to di&s;own that brave Action of their Amba&s;&s;ador: Thus by that &s;canda|lous procedure <HI>Spain</HI> &s;uffered in its Honour, and gave place to <HI>France,</HI> though there was nothing like nece&s;&s;ity for their doing it: I can &s;ee no other rea&s;on for't, but fear of <HI>Ca|non Law,</HI> and dread of the Troops which <HI>France</HI> keeps up to inforce its Commands, which are ju&s;t ready too, in ca&s;e the King of <HI>Spain</HI> &s;hould dye &s;uddenly. Let <HI>Charles</HI> II. take what care he can in &s;ettling the Succe&s;&s;ion, if he has re|&s;pect
<PB N="49" REF="26">for his own Family, and the la&s;t Will and intent of <HI>Philip</HI> IV. his Succe&s;&s;or will have enough to do, and a &s;curvy War to maintain. The Queen, who is altogether <HI>French</HI> both by her Birth and Inclinations, has her Faction in the Kingdom, and when the King is dead, will much ra|ther tru&s;t her <HI>Couzen-Germain,</HI> than a Prince who is a Stran|ger, at lea&s;t would be &s;o, were it not for the Marriage, which will be a great &s;trengthning to his Party. The Mar|riages of the <HI>Infanta's</HI> of <HI>Spain,</HI> with Kings of <HI>France,</HI> have ever been the cau&s;e of great differences between the two Crowns, and very fatal to <HI>Spain;</HI> but the Marriage of <HI>Ma|ria There&s;ia</HI> with <HI>Lewis</HI> XIV. compleats the mi&s;ery which is inevitably falling upon <HI>Spain,</HI> and how &s;tifly &s;oever the King of <HI>France</HI> may have denyed his de&s;igns, yet he never inten|ded to keep either his Word or Oath as to that matter. We are &s;ufficiently &s;atisfied by the ob&s;tacles he puts, that the <HI>Pyrenaean</HI> Treaty may not be regi&s;tred in Parliament; as al|&s;o by his Manife&s;to's (which have run all the World over) of the Queen of <HI>France</HI>'s <HI>Ju&s;t Pretentions.</HI> What good can <HI>Spain</HI> get by Marriages and Alliances with <HI>France?</HI> On the contrary very great Mi&s;chief, for 'tis by rea&s;on of the la&s;t Marriage that <HI>France</HI> layes claim to all this, the wi&s;er <HI>Philip</HI> II. preferr'd the Arch-Duke <HI>Erne&s;t,</HI> and afterward <HI>Albert.</HI> The Truce which <HI>France</HI> has now made, is de&s;ign'd only to amuze and lull <HI>Spain</HI> and its Allies a&s;leep: Thus to make them lay down their Arms, and in the mean time the <HI>French</HI> King has at lea&s;t a Hundred and Fifty Thou&s;and Men a foot, who dance up and down, &s;ometimes towards <HI>Al&s;ace,</HI> &s;ome|time toward <HI>Cologne,</HI> and pretty often toward the <HI>Low Coun|tries:</HI> All this is only to make them us'd to him, that &s;o they may think he has no de&s;ign upon them, and lay by all jealou&s;ie and &s;u&s;pition. But when he finds a good op|portunity, you &s;hall &s;ee him fall upon them, as a Hawk up|on
<PB N="50" REF="27">her quarry, and carry them off too if he plea&s;es; for what &s;hould hinder him, when there's not a Man in Arms, and by that time the Allies can be prepared, the King of <HI>France</HI> has done his bu&s;ine&s;s. Thus this Truce is only to bear in hand, and amuze the Princes of <HI>Europe,</HI> that they may not make War upon him, and that he may be con&s;tant|ly in a condition to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the <HI>Dauphins Right</HI> &s;o &s;oon as ever the King of <HI>Spain</HI> is dead, without any other legal Proce&s;s, but that of <HI>Dragoon Law:</HI> The <HI>Spaniards</HI> will find them&s;elves mi&s;erably deluded in relying upon this Truce. 'Tis <HI>a broken reed which will pierce through their hands,</HI> and if unhappily, the Emperour &s;hould be &s;till ingaged in a War with the <HI>Turks,</HI> what &s;hould hinder the two <HI>French</HI> Armies, the one in <HI>Catalonia,</HI> the other in the <HI>Low Countreys,</HI> from being Ma&s;ters of all where they go. I know very well that the Intere&s;t of <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Holland</HI> are both concern'd to defend the <HI>Spani&s;h Netherlands,</HI> as the &s;equel will &s;hew us: But in the one the <HI>French</HI> have &s;o true a Friend, (who has &s;o much bu&s;ine&s;s be&s;ide upon his hands at home) that he will concern him&s;elf no more for the <HI>Low Countreys,</HI> than his Predece&s;&s;or did for <HI>Luxemburg.</HI> As for the <HI>States</HI> they have but Men enough to defend their own Country, and are naturally very good Husbands: As for <HI>Cologne</HI> and <HI>Mun|&s;ter,</HI> his Maje&s;ty will probably put &s;ome Men into their Towns for them, as he has done heretofore.</P>
<P>I think it a va&s;t mi&s;take in the <HI>Spaniard,</HI> to &s;end Men into the <HI>Low Countreys</HI> for Governours (who for the mo&s;t part) go thither only to fill their Pur&s;e, as the &s;aying is, and &s;o return; and to do this effectually, they don't &s;cruple to rob both King and Countrey, pay neither Landlords nor Men, which makes them de&s;ert, &s;o that in&s;tead of One Thou&s;and Men in a Regiment, perhaps there is Fifty; and once I &s;aw a whole Regiment which was going to change Garri&s;on,
<PB N="51" REF="27">carried in a Waggon. In &s;hort, a Man need only to have been once in <HI>Flanders,</HI> to &s;ee this that I tell you, the Sol|diers upon the Guard hold out their Hats to you for an Alms, and the very Officers are fain to live with the Capu|chins upon the Alms which the good Men beg.</P>
<P>The three la&s;t <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Regiments which the King of <HI>England</HI> granted the King of <HI>Spain</HI> for the &s;ervice of the <HI>Low Coun|tries</HI> which were effectually rai&s;ed, are wa&s;ted like Snow be|fore the Sun, and now I don't believe there's Fifty Men left. <HI>Spain</HI> in my poor judgment is very much in the wrong for another thing, that is, to rely upon its Allies for the keep|ing of the <HI>Low Countries,</HI> and upon that &s;core to neglect ha|ving what Men are requi&s;ite for the Countreys &s;ecurity: Be&s;ides, they may be &s;ure that <HI>France,</HI> knowing the tem|per of the Governours &s;o very well, do often feel their Pul&s;e, and takes advantage of their weakne&s;s: Under&s;tan|ding Men will never be beat out on't, but that the Marquis of <HI>Grana</HI> was made a Tool, and put a helping hand to the taking of <HI>Luxemburg,</HI> the thing is as clear as the Sun at Noon-day; Four or Five Millions which he has left behind him are a &s;hrewd &s;ign of it: I tell you no improbable mat|ter, and nothing but what happens every day; there are very few Men in our Age, who are proof again&s;t a Million of Money; I confe&s;s there are &s;ome, but you mu&s;t grant me they are very rare: The <HI>Low Countreys</HI> are no Inheritance to the Governours, &s;o that they get all they can out of it, as if they hired it. I wont &s;ay that all who come there are of the &s;ame &s;tamp (God forbid) 'twould be &s;ad indeed if <HI>Spain</HI> had no Subjects that were hone&s;t; but 'tis very certain that for the&s;e la&s;t Ages, <HI>France</HI> has <HI>gallanted</HI> the <HI>Low Countries,</HI> and thinks them highly obliged, if not depending upon her. There's no trick which the <HI>French</HI> craft does not u&s;e to bring about their de&s;igns, for they have ever found that little
<PB N="52" REF="28">Countrey, a hard bone to pick, but their pre&s;ent King has given it devili&s;h bites the&s;e years la&s;t pa&s;t; <HI>France</HI> knows very well, too, that if they were once Ma&s;ters of it, they might then bend all their &s;trength toward <HI>Catalonia</HI> and <HI>Rou|&s;illon,</HI> and having nothing left to fear or quarrel about in that Countrey, march on quickly to <HI>Madrid,</HI> which is no diffi|cult matter when they have once made them&s;elves Ma&s;ters of &s;ome of the Frontiers to go in and out at. 'Tis for this rea&s;on that the Councils of <HI>Spain</HI> con&s;idering the &s;trength of <HI>France,</HI> &s;hould take other mea&s;ures than they do for the de|fence of the <HI>Low Countries,</HI> and I &s;ee but one only expedient in the po&s;ture that the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Affairs are in at pre&s;ent, which can give them pre&s;ent ea&s;e, except they had rather have that Countrey fall into the <HI>French</HI> hands, as without doubt it mu&s;t, if they don't prevent it &s;peedily. It is certain, that nothing but an Army with a good General can prevent the ruine which is falling upon their heads. We &s;ee after what fa&s;hion the Men, who are there now are paid; and the incon&s;idera|ble number of them, and to &s;ay the truth, there ought to be Twenty Thou&s;and effective Men (be&s;ide what is there al|ready, in Garri&s;on to &s;ecure the Countrey, and Ten Thou|&s;and more, in ca&s;e of a Rupture; and &s;ince <HI>Spain</HI> can't fur|ni&s;h them with &s;o many Men: You mu&s;t let the Towns there levy Men, and pay them who will be willing to do it, to &s;ecure them&s;elves, and avoi'd falling under the barbarous Dominion of the <HI>French,</HI> or be quite ruin'd perhaps, before it comes to that, as many Towns and Cities have been be|fore them, and that flat Country now of late, in which the mo&s;t Religious places were not &s;pared. I know very well that that propo&s;al has been debated in Council long &s;ince, and that the Council of <HI>Spain</HI> has ever rejected it for &s;light rea|&s;ons. A good careful Governour, e&s;pecially the Duke of <HI>Lorrain,</HI> who is &s;o brave a Commander, and adorn'd with
<PB N="53" REF="28">Conque&s;ts at the head of Forty Thou&s;and Men &s;upported by the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> would make <HI>France</HI> &s;hake. <HI>France</HI> has its Emi&s;&s;aries in the Council at <HI>Madrid,</HI> as well as at other places, to oppo&s;e every thing which may po&s;&s;ibly thwart her de&s;igns; and I am of opinion that it will turn to better account for the King of <HI>Spain</HI> to &s;ecure his <HI>Low Countries</HI> with the help of a Militi a payd by the Cities (who wont abu&s;e him) than to lo&s;e that Countrey for want of Men to defend it: The latter of the&s;e is almo&s;t irretrieva|ble, but that former would be effectual, were it not for an ill|grounded Jealou&s;ie, which po&s;&s;ibly heretofore might have de&s;erved con&s;ideration, but is now quite out of doors, for in my judgment we ought ever to take in hand the thing which is mo&s;t urgent, when the one is inevitable, and the other may probably never come to pa&s;s. I &s;ay once more, that <HI>France</HI> can never compa&s;s her great de&s;ign, but by be|ing fir&s;t of all Ma&s;ter of the <HI>Low Countreys:</HI> 'Twas for this rea&s;on that <HI>Du Ple&s;&s;is</HI> advi&s;ed his Ma&s;ter to &s;et upon it that way; and 'tis that pa&s;s alone which <HI>Spain</HI> and its Allies ought nece&s;&s;arily to &s;top with the &s;ame care and diligence, as they would the breach in a Bank, through which the raging Sea is ready to come in upon them, and this we &s;hall &s;ee hereafter.</P>
<P>The <HI>French</HI> Kings Ambition and Intere&s;t is a Torrent, who&s;e Impetuo&s;ity neither Affinity of Blood, nor Alliance, Peace, Treaties, Truce, Swearing, nor even Mutual Oaths are able to with&s;tand: I'le go farther, no not the very bounds which God by his wi&s;e Providence has &s;et to the li|mits of every Monarchy, which &s;eems to &s;peak to each Mo|narch, <HI>Hither &s;halt thou go, and no farther.</HI> But <HI>Lewis</HI> XIV. has &s;worn not to re&s;t &s;atisfied with the Lot which the Su|preme Monarch of the Univer&s;e has given him. Who can tell, had he once Conquered the World, but he would
<PB N="54" REF="29">begin again another <HI>Tower of Babel,</HI> to &s;cale the very Hea|vens? Ambition knows no bounds, but <HI>Pride goes before a fall.</HI></P>
<P>Oh that <HI>Spain</HI> would not &s;uffer her &s;elf to be lull'd a&s;leep by this deceitful Truce! 'Tis a <HI>Dalilah,</HI> which all on a &s;udden cry out to the <HI>Spaniards, the Phili&s;tians are upon thee:</HI> But I am afraid it will be &s;o as 'twas with <HI>Samp&s;on,</HI> who when he awoke, finding him&s;elf fa&s;t bound, could no longer avoid becoming a Prey and Conque&s;t to his Enemy. The <HI>Grandees</HI> of <HI>Spain</HI> are a great help to <HI>France,</HI> and con|tribute (without dreaming on't) very much to the advan|cing of her Intere&s;t, and &s;upport of her Ambition, whil'&s;t they inrich them&s;elves at their Ma&s;ters Expence, and in the mean time di&s;able him to keep up Men for their common defence; but if they were well advi&s;ed, they &s;hould reflect &s;eriou&s;ly upon the Condition they are in at pre&s;ent, and upon that they are like to be in when they fall under the Tyranny of <HI>France:</HI> How happily would &s;uch a compari|&s;on obviate the mi&s;ery which is coming upon them? For they mu&s;t think when a <HI>French</HI> Man comes to the Crown, that the <HI>Spaniards</HI> will be but little con&s;idered, and at be&s;t be only pittied or de&s;pi&s;ed: The natural antipathy between tho&s;e two Nations wont &s;uffer the new King to tru&s;t him|&s;elf with them, and all their &s;tateline&s;s will &s;erve only for the <HI>French</HI> Court to laugh and jeer at.</P>
<P>The <HI>Spaniards</HI> mu&s;t not flatter them&s;elves if that comes to pa&s;s, that the Dauphin after his Fathers Death, will leave <HI>France</HI> to go and live in <HI>Spain:</HI> The King's of <HI>France</HI> will alway value <HI>Ver&s;ailles</HI> beyond the fine&s;t City in <HI>Spain:</HI> They will &s;end Vice-Roys thither who &s;hall be <HI>Frenchmen</HI> both by nature and di&s;po&s;ition, Mortal Enemies to the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> that thus they may be &s;ecure that they wont join in any thing with the <HI>Spaniards</HI> again&s;t the <HI>French</HI> Intere&s;t. The&s;e Go|vernours
<PB N="55" REF="29">and Vice-Roys will bring along with them, for their nece&s;&s;ary u&s;e their <HI>French</HI> Tax, the <HI>Mal tote,</HI> which will in a little time bring forth a whole &s;warm of Impo&s;itions, as the <HI>Taille Taillon Aide, Grant,</HI> or <HI>Octroit, Preciput, Equivalent, Free Gift, Gratification, Aid</HI> upon <HI>Wines, Gabels</HI> upon <HI>Salt, Corn</HI> and <HI>Flower, Tobacco</HI> and <HI>Perriwigs,</HI> on all &s;orts of <HI>Stuffs, Linnen-cloth, Le pied fourchu,</HI> Impo&s;t upon <HI>Fle&s;h,</HI> the Mark of <HI>Paper,</HI> upon <HI>Silver</HI> and <HI>Tin,</HI> upon <HI>Milled</HI> and <HI>Silk Stockings,</HI> Impo&s;t upon <HI>Ice, Controlle des Exploits,</HI> Tax upon <HI>Fee-Farms,</HI> Tax upon the <HI>New Conque&s;ts, Quint</HI> and <HI>Requint, Mortmains,</HI> the price of Valuations, the Mark of Gold, the two <HI>Sols</HI> a pound, the right of Sealage, right of <HI>Controlle,</HI> of Regi&s;ter and Oath, <HI>La Paulette,</HI> abate|ment of Wages, Cu&s;tom, appointment of a Governour, the Eighth Peny, Impo&s;t and the re-union to the Crown of what&s;oever hath been given or &s;old, with &s;ome others not worth naming. Again, after that the <HI>Spaniards</HI> would have for their ho&s;ts &s;ome of tho&s;e Devili&s;h Farmers of the Kings Revenue who would fa&s;ten upon them, as if they were a Conquered Countrey, and at fir&s;t da&s;h would lay a Tax upon the Sun, knowing they make u&s;e of that in&s;tead of a Fagot.</P>
<P>Therefore I maintain that <HI>Spain</HI> &s;hould endeavour above all things, to di&s;po&s;e the Emperor to accept of a Peace, or at lea&s;t a Truce with the Grand Seignior: To look out while this pre&s;ent King is living, for a Prince to &s;ucceed him, and that this Prince may betake him&s;elf in time to <HI>Madrid</HI> to be well known to the people, and be in the Heart of the Kingdom; To Defend it, and get Crown'd immediately upon the Kings Death: To po&s;&s;e&s;s him&s;elf of the great Seal, and all In&s;truments relating to the Crown: And to make the Grandees of <HI>Spain</HI> &s;ide with him as their Lord and Ma&s;ter.</P>

<HEAD>The Policy of <HI>France</HI> and her Maximes in Reference to <HI>England.</HI></HEAD>
<P><HI>HEnry</HI> VIII. King of <HI>England</HI> in his time made a Gol|den Medal, on which was Engraven a Hand coming out of the Clouds, holding a pair of Scales equally poi&s;ed, the one Scale denoting <HI>Spain,</HI> and the other <HI>France,</HI> with a motto in <HI>Latin,</HI> to this purpo&s;e in <HI>Engli&s;h, I throw the Scales on that &s;ide I give my Friend&s;hip.</HI> Without doubt that Prince knew his power, but now I can compare <HI>England</HI> to nothing but an Ox, which knows not his own &s;trength and &s;uffers him&s;elf tamely to be yok'd. That Kingdom has this great advantage, that it Guards it &s;elf, and an Enemy can't invade it but with va&s;t difficulty. 'Tis not to be in|vaded without going often to and fro upon the Sea, they'l have Wind and Water to fight again&s;t, and a powerful Fleet to engage with before they &s;et foot a&s;hore: In&s;omuch that if the King of <HI>England</HI> be at peace with <HI>Holland,</HI> 'tis undeniable in his power to make the Victory lean to that &s;ide he is of: <HI>France</HI> has found this &s;o true, (although there is a perfect Hatred and Antipathy between tho&s;e two Na|tions) that &s;he has &s;pared no Co&s;t, and compa&s;&s;es Sea and Land to withdraw <HI>England</HI> from its true la&s;ting intere&s;t, and bring her over to their &s;ide, or at lea&s;t make her &s;tand <HI>Neuter,</HI> and look on with arms-acro&s;s, while the King of <HI>France</HI> Acts his Tragedy upon the Theatre of <HI>Europe.</HI> In the mean time tis mo&s;t certain that <HI>England</HI> can re&s;cue this &s;ame <HI>Europe</HI> from being en&s;laved to <HI>France,</HI> better than any other Nation, if &s;he plea&s;es.</P>
<P>If the King of <HI>Great Brittain</HI> did but know his own Strength and Real Intere&s;t, he might be not only the Medi|ator
<PB N="58" REF="31">and Umpire of the World, But might make Peace, when he plea&s;es, between all the Chri&s;tian Princes.</P>
<P>There are but two things requi&s;ite to effect this, both which are very ea&s;ie, nay are in the Kings power whenever he has a mind to't.</P>
<P>The Fir&s;t is, That the King of <HI>Great Britain</HI> take Care to be alwayes beloved by his People, and that there be a good under&s;tanding between him and his Parliament.</P>
<P>The Second is, To have a &s;trict Alliance with the <HI>&V;|nited-Provinces,</HI> and live in perfect Amity with them, and maintain inviolably this Union and Corre&s;pondence in all that Concerns each other. The former of the&s;e is mighty ea&s;ily done, and the King will obtain it effectually, when he once re&s;olves to Require nothing of his Parliament but what is agreeable to the Laws of the Realm, as he already promis'd in his Coronation Oath. The latter will be done &s;o &s;oon as His Maje&s;ty of <HI>Great Britain</HI> leaves li&s;tening to the <HI>French</HI> Emi&s;&s;aries, and puts out of his head all Jealou|&s;ies and Surmi&s;es which tho&s;e Creatures continually try to po&s;&s;e&s;s him with, having nothing that he need be afraid of from the <HI>States,</HI> who don't wi&s;h to <HI>Aggrandize</HI> them&s;elves, and U&s;urp their Neighbours Territories as <HI>France</HI> do's; but only keep what God has given them, and be able to protect their Countrey in the enjoyment of that Liberty they have at pre&s;ent. <HI>France,</HI> who is &s;atisfied of the Truth of what I have &s;aid, takes all occa&s;ions to ob&s;truct it; She is never without &s;ome of tho&s;e Helli&s;h Re&s;tle&s;s Spirits in the Kingdom, to &s;ow the <HI>Tares</HI> of mi&s;-under&s;tand|ings between the King and his Parliament. Ever &s;ince the Kings of <HI>England</HI> have appeared to be <HI>Prote&s;tants,</HI> this <HI>Catholicon</HI> has wrought well, and <HI>the Spirit of France</HI> has been at work to &s;et the Epi&s;copal Party again&s;t the <HI>Pres|byterian,</HI> and to in&s;inuate into the Minds of the latter, that
<PB N="59" REF="31">the Bi&s;hops were inclined to <HI>Popery,</HI> and that mo&s;t of them were Je&s;uites in Bi&s;hops Cloaths, Who would certainly &s;educe the people little by little, and be <HI>Turn Coates</HI> &s;o &s;oon as they have a good Opportunity, and dare di&s;cover their Opinion: That the King him&s;elf was Popi&s;hly-affected, and a thou&s;and things of this nature, which exa&s;perated the people, and made his Parliament jealous of him, for which rea&s;on they Granted nothing at all, or but very little of what the King ask't, and by this means his own private Occa&s;ions grew &s;o very urgent that he neglected the <HI>Pub|lick.</HI></P>
<P>In the Reign of <HI>Charles</HI> the Fir&s;t, twas <HI>France</HI> which kindled the fir&s;t Sparks of the Civil War, which cau&s;ed &s;o much Blood&s;hed both to King and People; in&s;omuch that when the <HI>French</HI> Amba&s;&s;ador return'd home from <HI>England,</HI> he boa&s;ted how he had kindled a fire which would not be <HI>put out</HI> a good while, and that for <HI>one twenty years England</HI> &s;hould not be in a Condition to do <HI>France</HI> any harm. One <HI>Father Jo&s;eph</HI> a <HI>Capuchin</HI> was in&s;trumental in <HI>fomenting</HI> the Divi&s;ion among the Catholicks under-hand, and I can a&s;&s;ure you there were &s;ome of tho&s;e Catholicks in the Par|liament Army: King <HI>Charles</HI> him&s;elf affirms it, and tells you that the Rebellion among them proceeded from his having denied them places, and as &s;oon as War was declared be|tween the King and Parliament, the King of <HI>France</HI> &s;ent <HI>Cromwel</HI> Six Hundred Thou&s;and <HI>Livres</HI> to pay his Army at the beginning. This is publickly known, and all who liv'd in that Age know it to be true. But at pre&s;ent the King of <HI>Great Brittain</HI> having chang'd his Religion, <HI>France</HI> has chang'd her Battery too, and the Church of <HI>England</HI> is now her main <HI>Piece of Ordinance:</HI> The people are &s;o exa&s;perated again&s;t each other, that his Maje&s;ty of <HI>Great Brittain</HI> mu&s;t think of little el&s;e this good while, and will find work enough in
<PB N="60" REF="32">his Kingdom to compa&s;s his Ends (even though he had got a Parliament at his Devotion) and if he &s;hould live Twenty years longer he would &s;carce &s;ee a Conclu&s;ion, but mu&s;t be fain to leave that bu&s;ine&s;s for his Succe&s;&s;our. So that the King had need &s;tand upon his Guard, while the people are thus di&s;-affected; He not being in a Condition to &s;end his Army abroad, nor having Money to maintain them, <HI>France</HI> in the mean time may do what &s;he plea&s;es, may take the <HI>Low-Countries,</HI> and all <HI>Spain</HI> too if the King of <HI>Spain</HI> happens to dye, which is the thing <HI>France</HI> waits for &s;o impatiently.</P>
<P>For the Second thing, which is an Alliance with the <HI>&V;nited Provinces,</HI> and a perfect Harmony and Agreement between tho&s;e two Potentates, to oppo&s;e all Kings or Princes whatever, who &s;hall offer to violate the peace of <HI>Chri&s;tendom.</HI> 'Tis an undoubted Truth that the <HI>States</HI> de|&s;ire it of all things, provided it be done &s;o &s;ecurely as they may venture to rely upon it, and be back't upon occa&s;ion. Of which there is &s;mall likelihood &s;o long as things are as they are in <HI>England.</HI> This is what <HI>France</HI> would not wil|lingly &s;ee, &s;ince the joyning of the&s;e two powers would probably divert her from many Enterprizes, and make her lo&s;e her longing to undertake any thing contrary to the late Treaties of peace at <HI>Nimeghen</HI> and the Truce: But <HI>France</HI> takes Care to hinder this, and the mi&s;tru&s;t and jealou&s;ie which &s;he keeps afoot in <HI>England</HI> like magnifying Gla&s;&s;es, makes the trivialle&s;t Objects look greater than they are, both in publick and private Affairs: We need go no far|ther than the bu&s;ine&s;s of <HI>Bantam,</HI> which might long ago have been accommodated, but <HI>France</HI> thinks it more u&s;eful to her, that things be let alone as they are, and neither go forward nor backward, for fear of a happy Re&s;ult. An Union of <HI>England</HI> with the <HI>&V;nited Provinces</HI> would give
<PB N="61" REF="32">no great encouragement to the <HI>French</HI> de&s;igns upon the <HI>Spa|ni&s;h Netherlands,</HI> for if <HI>England</HI> were &s;o minded, the King of <HI>France</HI> could never do any good, if the late King would but have &s;eemed to have &s;tir'd, the <HI>French</HI> had never taken <HI>Luxemburg,</HI> but they knew his weakne&s;s, and were &s;o cun|ning to blind him, that he good Prince, never &s;aw the mi&s;|chief on't till after the City was taken.</P>
<P><HI>England</HI> acted very much again&s;t her own Intere&s;t, when &s;he parted with <HI>Dunkirk,</HI> that City opened the Gate to go into <HI>France</HI> and the <HI>Low Countries:</HI> But now 'twill be other|wi&s;e if tho&s;e Countreys fall under the yoak of <HI>Lewis le Grand,</HI> and if he by his Conque&s;ts joins <HI>Neuport</HI> and <HI>O&s;tend</HI> to <HI>Dunkirk: Flu&s;&s;ing</HI> in a little time will be thought conveni|ent for him, and then he may very well begin to di&s;pute the Dominion of the Seas with <HI>England,</HI> and ob&s;truct her Commerce; and if at la&s;t the King of <HI>France</HI> Ma&s;ters <HI>Hol|land,</HI> which misfortune may happen, (the <HI>Low Countries</HI> being lo&s;t) <HI>England</HI> may very well think 'tis her turn next. As 'twas for this Rea&s;on that Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> told heretofore Moun&s;ieur <HI>Sully</HI> the Mo&s;t Chri&s;tian Kings Emba&s;&s;ador, that neither <HI>France,</HI> nor <HI>England,</HI> nor any other Prince had any right to pretend to the <HI>Low-Countreys,</HI> and further, that &s;he would never &s;uffer, that his King &s;hould &s;o much as think on't.</P>
<P>This very <HI>Sully</HI> in a Letter to <HI>Henry</HI> IV. &s;ent him word, <HI>That with a great Army (for all what the Queen had &s;aid) he might take a cour&s;e to keep them in order, and take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of &s;uch Lands and Cities in the Low Countries, as he &s;hould think fit for his turn, and join</HI> France <HI>intirely with the</HI> United Provin|ces <HI>which is the only means</HI> (&s;ays he) <HI>to re&s;tore</HI> France <HI>to its Antient &s;plendour, and make her Superiour to all the re&s;t of Chri|&s;tendom: For if once by hook or by crook the Provinces of</HI> Lux|emburg, Juliers, la Marck, Mons, Limburg, Aix, <HI>and</HI> Cleves
<PB N="62" REF="33"><HI>were united to</HI> France, <HI>without doubt all the re&s;t of the Country would be forc't to follow their example, being &s;eparated from any communication with the re&s;t of the World. France</HI> has been fixt that way ever &s;ince &s;he &s;aw there was no good to be done towards <HI>Italy,</HI> but all the Princes of <HI>Europe</HI> are highly concerned to put a &s;top to that Conque&s;t: And there are on|ly tho&s;e two Neighbouring Powers which are able, and who&s;e Intere&s;t it is mo&s;t, to hinder the progre&s;s that <HI>France</HI> makes in the <HI>Low Countries,</HI> which will draw after it, as I have &s;aid before, dire effects: As for <HI>Spain</HI> of it &s;elf, 'tis on|ly a Body &s;tanding aloof off from its Members, which has nothing left but her Tongue: She is reduc't &s;o low, as even to &s;ay her Prayers to <HI>Notre Dame Charite,</HI> and to beg her good Ma&s;ters and Friends to take care of her, and not for|&s;ake her: <HI>England</HI> can do much toward the pre&s;erving the <HI>Low Countries,</HI> and if her King had not promis't, to &s;it &s;till, <HI>Luxemburg</HI> would have been at this time as 'twas before, a bone for <HI>France</HI> to pick. His Mo&s;t Chri&s;tian Maje&s;ty knows this very well, and 'tis for this rea&s;on that he takes &s;o much pains to keep his <HI>Britanique</HI> Maje&s;ty firm to his Intere&s;ts, and if he wont declare for him, at lea&s;t that he will look on, and accept a neutrality. To bring this about, he &s;pares nothing, neither Pre&s;ents, nor Pen&s;ion, nor Tricks; and I may &s;afely &s;ay, that the Money which <HI>France</HI> gives, is a venomous Serpent, lurking under the Ro&s;e-leaves, it &s;miles for the pre&s;ent, but will frown &s;everely afterward; 'tis an Iron Chain plaited over with Gold, beautiful in ap|pearance, to attract and deceive the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> but they will one day feel its weight and hardne&s;s, if they don't make an early di&s;covery of the ba&s;e ends he has who offers it, who will be their ruine at la&s;t, &s;ince they can't &s;ub&s;i&s;t, but by a due ballance between <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Spain.</HI> I conclude then, that 'tis the King of <HI>Englands</HI> apparent Intere&s;t, for &s;elf-pre&s;ervation,
<PB N="63" REF="33">and advancing of Trade, to oppo&s;e the King of <HI>France</HI> his Conque&s;ts in the <HI>Law Countries;</HI> for if he does not, and &s;uppo&s;ing that after the lo&s;s of that Countrey, Fortune favours him, and lets him be Ma&s;ter of all the Se|venteen Provinces (which may very well come to pa&s;s, if the <HI>States</HI> are not &s;econded, and &s;tand only upon their own Leggs) in what a condition will <HI>England</HI> be? <HI>France</HI> will be &s;tronger at Sea, and more Potent in the <HI>Indies</HI> than &s;he; <HI>France</HI> will interfere with her in Traffique every day, &s;he will con&s;tantly have a brave Navy at Sea, and e&s;pecially in the Spring, which will not let a mou&s;e &s;tir out of the <HI>En|gli&s;h</HI> Ports without leave, and upon the lea&s;t re&s;entment, farewel <HI>England</HI> to all intents and purpo&s;es, &s;ince there's no body left who will or dare lift up a finger in her defence.</P>
<P>Moreover <HI>Englands</HI> be&s;t Policy is to keep <HI>France</HI> under, not only to maintain her Dominion of the Seas, but al&s;o to find a convenient opportunity for the recovery of her An|tient <HI>Deme&s;nes</HI> which <HI>France</HI> keeps from her for Example, <HI>Britain, Normandy, Poitou, Languedock,</HI> and all <HI>France</HI> too, which belongs to it by the Marriage of the King of <HI>En|gland</HI> with <HI>Margaret,</HI> Daughter of <HI>Philip the Fair,</HI> from this Match came <HI>Henry</HI> V. of <HI>England,</HI> who had as much Right to <HI>France</HI> as the Dauphin has to <HI>Spain:</HI> For the three Sons of <HI>Philip the Fair, Lovis Hutin, Philip the Long,</HI> and <HI>Charles the Fair</HI> dyed all without I&s;&s;ue-male, and it was after this, when the King of <HI>England</HI> &s;ued for his Right to the Kingdom of <HI>France,</HI> that the <HI>Salique</HI> Law was fir&s;t intro|duc't, u&s;her'd in by a Sermon which the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Beauvais</HI> preacht before the Convention of the <HI>States,</HI> proving by the Go&s;pel, which &s;ayes, <HI>The Lillies &s;pin not,</HI> that by con|&s;equence the <HI>Flower de lis</HI> which repre&s;ents <HI>France,</HI> ought never to fall to the Di&s;taff: But that Law could only af|fect what was to come, and not what was pa&s;t. Afterward
<PB N="64" REF="34"><HI>Henry</HI> V. King of <HI>England</HI> came over into <HI>France</HI> with a Po|tent Army, won &s;everal Victories, and at la&s;t Married <HI>Ca|therine,</HI> Daughter of <HI>Charles</HI> VI. and in the year 1421 it was &s;inally decreed and concluded, that <HI>Henry</HI> &s;hould be King of <HI>France:</HI> Now <HI>I&s;abel</HI> Queen of <HI>France,</HI> Mother to <HI>Catherine</HI> Queen of <HI>England,</HI> made her la&s;t Will in favour of her Son in Law, and declared him Heir to all her E&s;tate, and to the Crown, which in my judgment is a great addition to the Right which the Kings of <HI>England</HI> have to the Realm of <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P>If the King of <HI>France</HI> had but had that Right to <HI>England</HI> which the King of <HI>England</HI> has to <HI>France,</HI> what a Company of Manife&s;toes and Writings &s;hould we have flie about? to demon&s;trate his <HI>ju&s;t pretentions,</HI> as he calls every thing he is plea&s;ed to lay a claim to.</P>
<P>So that let the King of <HI>England</HI> take a view of <HI>France</HI> which way &s;oever he will, he ought alway to &s;u&s;pect her, and &s;tand upon his guard, as again&s;t one whom he certain|ly knows to be his Enemy. He may ju&s;tly be a&s;&s;ured that he does not coaks him &s;o without a de&s;ign to get &s;omething out of him, and becau&s;e he knows him the only one who is able to counterpoize his Affairs: Therefore 'tis no wonder that <HI>Lewis</HI> XIV. took &s;o much pains to &s;upply the late King <HI>Charles</HI> II. Nece&s;&s;ities, and &s;atisfie his Plea&s;ure, Moun&s;ieur <HI>Barillen,</HI> and Madam <HI>Port&s;mouth</HI> can ju&s;tifie what I &s;ay, but I can a&s;&s;ure you that the King of <HI>France</HI> regards neither Princes nor private Per&s;ons one jot farther than as they are for his turn: Nay farther, Even Vertue it &s;elf is only e&s;teem'd by him, &s;o long as &s;he &s;quares with his Intere&s;t: What value pray did he put upon either Princes or Prin|ce&s;&s;es during <HI>Cromwel</HI>'s Government? Were they not obli|ged to retire (not to &s;ay driven) out of <HI>France?</HI> What &s;ub&s;i&s;tnance or help had their Princes in their Exile from
<PB N="65" REF="34"><HI>France?</HI> No, 'tis to the Family of <HI>Orange,</HI> that they are ob|liged, which furni&s;ht them with con&s;iderable Sums of Mo|ney; but on the contrary <HI>France</HI> was the promoter of the late Troubles of <HI>England,</HI> &s;he gave the Princes no protecti|on, and never contributed the lea&s;t toward the re-e&s;tabli&s;h|ing of the late King in his Throne.</P>
<P>All this con&s;idered, neither ju&s;t re&s;entment from the Royal Family, nor the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Intere&s;t can decently allow of &s;uch clo&s;e Alliances with <HI>France,</HI> as &s;hall be able to make <HI>England</HI> &s;hut her Eyes, or be a by-&s;tander, whil&s;t <HI>Lewis</HI> XIV. takes the <HI>Low Countries:</HI> But on the other &s;ide, &s;he ought to be continually in a po&s;ture to hinder her in every the lea&s;t attempt &s;he makes towards it, and to make u&s;e of the Six Regiments in <HI>Holland,</HI> which the <HI>States</HI> won't refu&s;e upon &s;uch an occa&s;ion, to prevent the King of <HI>France</HI> his bringing more Men down upon <HI>Flanders:</HI> I am per&s;waded that tho&s;e Six Regiments would be able to cope with double the num|ber of the <HI>French;</HI> and thus by <HI>Englands</HI> only &s;howing of her Teeth, <HI>Europe</HI> will be &s;afe: <HI>Re&s;i&s;t the Devil, and he will flie from you:</HI> But if you are afraid of him, he'l &s;oon ma&s;ter you. <HI>France</HI> has cut out work for King <HI>James</HI> now Reigning: The Enterprize which he has taken in hand is &s;o great, that many Men fear, and others hope, that he will never get quit of it with his Life. 'Tis no time to change Laws when the Enemy is at the Gate: 'Tis not convenient at all times, to think of working great Conver&s;ions, &s;ome Battles mu&s;t be fought, to let the World &s;ee a Character both of a Soldier and a Polititian. All the World expected this and more from the King. His Mighty Courage put all <HI>Eu|rope</HI> in hopes, that he would be an Univer&s;al Comforter to them, and would afford &s;ome re&s;pite to <HI>Spain.</HI> But alas!

<PB N="66" REF="35">which it may be he won't be able to quench when he plea&s;es; and &s;o long as he does &s;o, he dares not call a Legal Free Parliament.</P>
<P><HI>Spain</HI> lo&s;t her &s;elf by bani&s;hing the <HI>Moors</HI> out of the King|dom. <HI>France</HI> is weakned by the Conver&s;ions &s;he has wrought, and by driving out the Hugonots, and &s;he has a great mind that the King of <HI>England</HI> would follow her Exam|ple.

<P>Now if this be not &s;ufficient to make the <HI>Cantons</HI> &s;eriou&s;ly reflect upon <HI>Lewis</HI> XIV. his proceedings in re&s;pect of them, at lea&s;t that Cannon which the Fort of <HI>Huningen</HI> di&s;charged upon the City of <HI>Ba&s;il</HI> might open their Eyes, for the U&s;urper gets ground every day, and I'le warrant you no &s;ooner &s;hall he find a favourable oppor|tunity, but he will improve his quarrel with <HI>Germany</HI> again&s;t them.

<P>I told you the <HI>French</HI> King takes advantage by the difference of Religion in the <HI>Cantons</HI> to foment di&s;cord among&s;t them, as we have lately ob&s;erved in the bu&s;ine&s;s of <HI>Glaris,</HI> which &s;etting a&s;ide the
<PB N="88" REF="46">Popes Nuncio's &s;tirring in it, would have proved the fir&s;t &s;park of Fire and Di&s;&s;ention among&s;t them, then which he de&s;ires nothing more the better to further his Affairs, and his pretended Reign over <HI>Eu|rope.</HI> The <HI>Roman Catholicks</HI> in tho&s;e parts are commonly ignorant in their Religion, and being very &s;tupid at the bark, and with the out|&s;ide, without ever &s;earching into Fundamentals; the only name of Catholick actuates, moves, and incites them, without inquiring any farther; but I would have them once for all be undeceived; not &s;uffer them&s;elves to be impo&s;ed upon under the fal&s;e Notion of Catholick: 'Tis a fal&s;e mask under which he lurks the better to de|ceive them, and bring them to his Leure; thereby to &s;et them at odds among&s;t them&s;elves, and having once done that, he will come pouring down upon <HI>Ba&s;il</HI> or <HI>Geneva,</HI> yea, perhaps upon both toge|ther. The&s;e are bars and boundaries which ought to be in a manner Sacred; the <HI>Cantons</HI> &s;hould take care that they be never &s;uffered to be medled with nor touched; they are to defend them with their Sword in their Hand to the la&s;t drop of Blood; for this pa&s;&s;age being clea|red, and the di&s;cord breaking out among&s;t them, farewel they, they are undone to all intents and purpo&s;es, of free <HI>Swi&s;&s;e</HI> they'l become <HI>French</HI> Slaves: But now if the generality of the <HI>Swi&s;&s;e</HI> be but true to one another, and united, and but &s;hew the U&s;urper their Teeth, intimating their re&s;olution of defending what's their own, they may be &s;ure the <HI>French</HI> King will only bark at a di&s;tance, on the other hand, if they &s;hew no more eagerne&s;s for the&s;e two Cities than they did for <HI>Franche Compte:</HI> If they make no &s;touter a re&s;i&s;tance than they did there, they will unavoidably po&s;t on to their total ruine and de&s;truction. I know <HI>France</HI> will not bring them under their yoak, but make them tributary. They are now free and ab&s;olute, but let them take heed they &s;uffer not their Necks to be brought un|der their yoak; let them call to mind their Ancient Valour, that their Countrey has proved a Sepulchre to the <HI>French,</HI> and that they have forced them to a di&s;honourable retreat: <HI>Geneva</HI> is a delicate bit the <HI>French</HI> have a Moneths mind to, &s;ince &s;he hath appropriated to her &s;elf the County of <HI>Gex,</HI> methinks that Republick too lyes very commodiou&s;ly for her purpo&s;e: They have a long time muttered at the <HI>French</HI> Court, that they meant to re&s;ettle the Bi&s;hop a Savoyard who is nominated by the Duke of <HI>Savoy,</HI> whom he makes to re&s;ide at his Court to make his Right appear: If it were as ea&s;ie for the <HI>French</HI> King to &s;ettle a Bi&s;hop there as it has been for him to &s;ettle
<PB N="89" REF="46">a Re&s;ident, he would have accompli&s;ht it long ago: Now &s;ince this Re&s;ident comes in our way, let us &s;peak a word or two by the by concerning his Re&s;idence. You mu&s;t know he is as nece&s;&s;ary a Man there, <HI>as the Fifth wheel in a Chariot,</HI> for he is good for nothing but to receive the <HI>Swi&s;&s;e</HI> Packet of Letters for the Court, which a Merchant formerly received, &s;o that the Sallary, and the Abode of &s;uch a Mi|ni&s;ter would be u&s;ele&s;s, if there were not &s;omething el&s;e in it. I dare &s;ay he would have but a poor pittance, had he no other com|ings in but what <HI>France</HI> allows him, and if he had not the be&s;t part of it from the Clergy: I do remember that the fir&s;t Man that filled this worthy place, was one <HI>Charigni,</HI> a poor pittiful Fellow, whom Moun&s;ieur <HI>De Pompone</HI> had often relea&s;ed out of <HI>Fort L'eve&s;que</HI> whi|ther he was committed for Debt, and &s;ent him thither to get him di&s;intangled: There he made a Trade of the <HI>Catholick Religion,</HI> for every Sunday and Holy-day was his days of Receipts; every <HI>Sa|voyard</HI> that came to Ma&s;s, giving to the Offering Five or Six Sou&s;e, under pretence of maintaining the Church and Prie&s;t, but rather Moun&s;ieur the Re&s;ident, who be&s;ides kept a kind of an Ordinary where they might dine, the poor Wretch was fain to catch at any thing, for he was no better than a Beads-man living upon Alms at <HI>Paris,</HI> being forced to quit <HI>Province</HI> upon the account of &s;ome fal&s;e pieces of Five &s;ous he would have put off, where he was reduc't to Ex|tremity, and all the &s;tir he kept at <HI>Geneva</HI> was only to make the Magi|&s;trate to gree&s;e his fi&s;t, and pre&s;ent him with &s;omething by the by, <HI>as no body knew.</HI> But &s;ince the time his Secretary has changed his Religion, and &s;ince he gave his Almoner a box on the Ear, becau&s;e he &s;poke in behalf of the Prote&s;tants, upon a Sermon that he and the Re&s;ident came from hearing: I &s;ay, from that time he hath laid open his folly, he is countermanded, and another of better &s;en&s;e and more di&s;cretion &s;upplies his place. Con&s;idering the de&s;ign the King has in hand of dividing this City, it &s;eems to be in a manner nece&s;&s;ary at pre&s;ent to have a Re&s;ident to acquaint him with all concerns, to find out where|in their &s;trength and weakne&s;s con&s;i&s;ts; yea, to corrupt &s;ome Magi|&s;trate or other, as at <HI>Strasbourg;</HI> the enterprize of the Duke of <HI>Savoy</HI> in the year <GAP DESC="blank"> ought continually to be before their Eyes as a warning; for it is certain, that the <HI>French</HI> King with what amu&s;ement &s;oever he may &s;eem to divert them; doth but wait a fair opportuni|ty to &s;pring his Mine, give fire to his Train, and play his old game as he did at <HI>Strasbourg;</HI> &s;o that it mightily behoves the Citizens of
<PB N="90" REF="47"><HI>Geneva</HI> to &s;tand upon their guard, and endeavour to di&s;po&s;e their Allies to afford them &s;uccour &s;o &s;oon as ever they find that grand U&s;urper to advance; for he is now taking his aim, and &s;o well play'd his Cards, that he hath made the Duke of <HI>Savoy</HI> to &s;neak and truckle, not daring &s;o much as to put his No&s;e towards <HI>France:</HI> In times pa&s;t, the Dukes Ance&s;tors did defend the City of <HI>Geneva</HI> as well as the Inhabitants; they had a great deal more rea&s;on for it then <HI>France</HI> now a days, upon the account of the preten&s;ions to it, and the rights the Counts of <HI>Geneva</HI> have yielded up to the Duke of <HI>Savoy. Charles</HI> IV. Proclaimed that Duke Prince of <HI>Geneva,</HI> and of all the Territo|ries thereunto belonging, and they have inherited it till the Year, 1532. But the pre&s;ent Duke is &s;o far from making any oppo&s;ition again&s;t <HI>France,</HI> that he would rather deliver up all his Rights and Claims to it, and let him&s;elf be cullyed out of it under pretence of reinve&s;ting the Bi&s;hop; now although that Prelate &s;hould be &s;etled, and <HI>France</HI> ma&s;ter of it, what cour&s;e would the Duke of <HI>Savoy</HI> take, if the King would not remit to him? Would he have recour&s;e to Menaces or Repri&s;als? If he &s;hould do &s;o, the King of <HI>France</HI> would jerk him &s;oundly, like a Boy, and would make him ki&s;s the Rod to boot. So that I would not have <HI>Geneva</HI> to flatter her &s;elf with the treacherous promi&s;es of the <HI>French</HI> King, nor yet with the A&s;&s;i&s;tance; which Policy and Rea&s;on might oblige the Duke of <HI>Savoy</HI> to &s;end them. Let her e'ne rely on her Allies the <HI>Swi&s;&s;e Cantons,</HI> upon her own, though &s;lender Forces, and upon &s;o many <HI>French</HI> Officers who have fled for refuge thither, who will be &s;ure upon the fir&s;t news of it, to run to her a&s;&s;i&s;tance, or otherwi&s;e they mu&s;t have lo&s;t com|mon Sen&s;e, and all &s;entiments of Honour and Thankfulne&s;s. Again, if &s;o be the Emperour make his Peace with the <HI>Turk,</HI> he mu&s;t &s;end for the Duke of <HI>Lorain</HI> to help him, who is a great Captain, and even laden with Victorious Lawrels, who&s;e very name will make <HI>France</HI> quake. I, and he may &s;erve him for a inlet whereat to enter into his Dutchy of <HI>Lorrain;</HI> where his Subjects quite &s;pent with the Tyrannical Dominion of <HI>France,</HI> expect him as their <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> and deliverer.</P>
<P>The King is a Lyon in a Foxes Skin, he is not &s;o formidable as men believe him; his only end is to make him&s;elf be feared, and he obtains his de&s;ire by threatnings; but &s;hake off this panick fear, look upon <HI>France</HI> nearer, mind her &s;oberly and &s;eriou&s;ly, con&s;ider the continual running away of her Inhabitants, the puni&s;hment and
<PB N="91" REF="47">impri&s;onment of another part of them, is as &s;o much Bloud flowing from her Veins, which by little and little weaken her. Add hereto the ju&s;t complaints of the Catholicks, the decrea&s;e of her Revenues, and what is wor&s;t of all for her, the death and the going away of &s;o many Generals within the&s;e few years, and &s;o &s;uddenly one after another, doth &s;he not &s;eem to behold that Scene Heaven hath contri|ved on purpo&s;e to humble her, for indeed &s;he is at a lower ebb then one would imagine: I'll engage &s;he is as &s;ick as her King, and that they be both &s;mitten to the heart.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t Enemy that &s;ets upon her will not be long alone, he will be &s;oon &s;econded; but it will be ju&s;t as in the Fable of the Coun&s;el of Rats, who con&s;ulted together to go hang a Bell at the Cats neck their &s;worn Enemy, but not one of them dur&s;t venture to do it fir&s;t. Who would ever have &s;aid the Pope would have contributed his a&s;&s;i&s;tance to the Union of the <HI>Switzers?</HI> Yet 'tis true he did &s;o, as we may have ob&s;erved in the bu&s;ine&s;s of <HI>Glaris,</HI> which I have above recited: Nay his <HI>Nuncio</HI> is very intent, at his lei&s;ure hours, to open the eyes of the Catholick <HI>Cantons;</HI> for tho&s;e &s;illy people, provided the King tell them of intending to re-e&s;tabli&s;h a Bi&s;hop, 'tis enough for them, that's all they care for, but they are not &s;en&s;ible of what is behind the Hill, that the grand U&s;urper lyes hid under the Bi|&s;hops Mitre.</P>
<P>I have but one Admonition more to give the Right Honourable <HI>Cantons</HI> of <HI>Switzerland,</HI> that is to &s;ay, the King hath no re&s;pect nor good will towards them. He takes them for Scaffolds to be made u&s;e of when need requires, and when that is over, he looks upon them as no body. I de&s;ire no other proof of what I &s;ay, then what of a fre&s;h date happened to the Amba&s;&s;ador, which the <HI>Cantons</HI> not long &s;ince &s;ent to the <HI>French</HI> King: After he had wrangled with them about their Commi&s;&s;ion not being in general Terms, on pur|po&s;e to refu&s;e them Audience; well, this difficulty once removed by a &s;econd Commi&s;&s;ion di&s;patched to them, they were e'ne fain to go away as they came, without &s;o much as &s;eeing the King, or ob|taining one only Audience. This is the greate&s;t undervaluing, and mo&s;t &s;en&s;ible affront that ever Free-born men had given; and if the <HI>Cantons</HI> pa&s;s by this, and don't &s;hew their ju&s;t Re&s;entments of it, they'l be de&s;pi&s;ed by all the Princes of <HI>Europe;</HI> and it will not be the la&s;t ill turn of this nature that will befall.

In the mean time behold the Marqui&s;s <HI>de Lavardin</HI> keeping watch and ward night and day, and that round about the Palace of <HI>Ferne&s;e,</HI> ju&s;t as if it were a Fort &s;ur|rounded with enemies, before the Pope and the Conclave of Cardi|nals No&s;es: By all the&s;e riots and indignities done to the mo&s;t emi|nent per&s;on of the Church, Vicar of Chri&s;t, and St. <HI>Peters</HI> Succe&s;&s;or, is nothing in compari&s;on to that which <HI>Talon</HI> the Kings Advocate hath belched forth again&s;t his Holine&s;s, and the Cardinals his Coun|&s;ellors, accu&s;ing the former to be a favourer of Here&s;ie, Jan&s;eni&s;me, and of Quieti&s;ts, and a thou&s;and other impertinences, which is to be &s;een more at large in the demand of the above&s;aid <HI>Talon</HI> to the Par|liament of <HI>Paris,</HI> and by the Emba&s;&s;adors prote&s;tation publickly af|fixed at <HI>Rome,</HI> the expre&s;&s;ions therein are &s;candalous, that they might de&s;ervedly procure the fire for a private per&s;on; but when one hath the power in his own hand, he thinks he may Lawfully &s;ay and do what&s;oever likes him: But the Pope who is grave and wi&s;e will let him go on, yea peradventure his great mode&s;ty and prudent beha|viour may make the King come to him&s;elf again, and acknowledge the wrong, and that the Pope is Ma&s;ter at home in his own Hou&s;e, and may be able to di&s;annul and take away the Franchi&s;es of the Em|ba&s;&s;adors quarters, when he &s;hall &s;ee it convenient for the repo&s;e of his People, and his own Con&s;cience.</P>
<P>It is not his frequenting Ma&s;s which is a Characteri&s;tical mark of being a Chri&s;tian, or for being kind to the Je&s;uits; for fear awes Princes &s;ometimes to make much of Je&s;uits, and &s;hew much re&s;pect to them. <HI>Hen.</HI> IV. was not free from this fear, when he would have re&s;tored them in <HI>France;</HI> for when the Duke of <HI>Sully</HI> advi&s;ed him to the contrary, he &s;tarted up and replyed, <HI>&s;ecure me my Life then;</HI> for 'twas more then probable, that tho&s;e who &s;ued for their return had a&s;&s;ured the King, that if he did not do it he would be in immi|nent danger of being Murthered: When Life is at &s;take what will not a man do to &s;ave it? Who can tell but the&s;e good Fathers have told the King now Reigning, if in ca&s;e he did not root out all the
<PB N="96" REF="50"><HI>Huguenots</HI> out of his Dominions, this mu&s;t come in alwayes, <HI>ad majorem Dei Gloriam,</HI> that he would endanger his Life.</P>
<P>What &s;ign of a Chri&s;tian was there in the King when he made a League with <HI>Cromwel</HI> to fall upon the <HI>Low Countries,</HI> and to bani&s;h <HI>Charles</HI> II. from his Kingdom, who was rightful Succe&s;&s;or to the Crown of <HI>England,</HI> and a good Catholick in his heart, although af|terwards out of Policy he was fain to appear otherwi&s;e.</P>
<P>Again, what &s;ign of Chri&s;tianity doth there appear in a Prince who a&s;&s;i&s;ts Count <HI>Tekely</HI> in league with the <HI>Turks</HI> again&s;t the Empe|rour? A King who forbids all Bi&s;hops and Curats throughout his Dominion to cau&s;e <HI>Te Deum</HI> to be &s;ung for the Victories of the Chri|&s;tians obtained over the <HI>Turks,</HI> who impedes by force of <HI>Lewi&s;&s;es</HI> the progre&s;s of the King of <HI>Polands</HI> Forces again&s;t the &s;ame <HI>Turks,</HI> that they may have the opportunity to employ all the <HI>Ottoman</HI> Forces a|gain&s;t the Emperour, thereby to make him abandon what he hath got at the dear rate of &s;o much Chri&s;tian blood.</P>
<P>What Chri&s;tianity do you ob&s;erve in the Kings proceeding at the Cities of <HI>Genoua</HI> and <HI>Orange,</HI> where he hath no right at all: So that by all that I have alledged, all the&s;e Titles of mo&s;t Chri&s;tian and Ca|tholick Zeal the King is &s;o much taken with, and affects, is only a deceitful mask of hypocri&s;ie to lull the Catholick Princes a&s;leep, the better to play his game, and make him&s;elf Ma&s;ter of them one af|ter another. Although the King of <HI>England</HI> would hinder him, as being the only man that could be&s;t do it, he would endeavour to cau&s;e an in&s;urrection of the Church of <HI>England</HI> men again&s;t him, he would &s;end them Money and Officers as he did to <HI>Cromwel;</HI> &s;o that one may &s;ay of the <HI>French</HI> King that he becomes all things to all men, when his intere&s;t is at &s;take: He enters into Covenant with <HI>Turk</HI> or <HI>Hugue|not, Pagans</HI> or <HI>Infidels,</HI> again&s;t Catholicks them&s;elves, if it be nece&s;&s;a|ry for promoting his greatne&s;s, and to attain to the Monarchy of all <HI>Europe.</HI> And for a conclu&s;ion this is the Kings Religion, and your Wit and Policy of <HI>France.</HI></P>
