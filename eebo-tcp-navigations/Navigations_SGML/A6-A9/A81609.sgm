<HEAD>An Adverti&s;ement to the Reader.</HEAD>
<P>_I <HI>Thought it fitting not to in&s;truct, but ra|ther to remember the Reader, that this Sea, over which the</HI> Venetians <HI>challenge Sovereigntie and Dominion, beeing com|monly called the</HI> Gulph, <HI>is nothing el&s; but a large bay or inlet of the &s;ea, which entering in betwixt two lands; and &s;evering them for manie miles continuance, in the end receiv's a &s;top or interruption of further pa&s;sage, by an oppo&s;ite &s;hore, which join's both the &s;aid lands toge|ther. It is called the</HI> Gulph of Venice, <HI>from the ci|tie of</HI> Venice, <HI>&s;ituated upon certain broken I&s;lands near unto the bottom thereof. It is al&s;o called the</HI> Adriatick Sea, <HI>from the antient citie of</HI> Adria, <HI>lying not far di&s;tant from the former. From the entrance thereof unto the bottom, it contein's in length about 600 Italian miles: where it is broade&s;t it is 160 miles ever, in others but 80, in the mo&s;t 100. The &s;outh|we&s;t &s;hore of it is bounded by the Provinces of</HI> Pugha, <HI>and</HI> Abruzzo <HI>in the kingdom of</HI> Naples, <HI>the Mar|qui&s;ate of</HI> Ancona <HI>and</HI> Romagnia <HI>in the Pope's State,
<PB REF="3"> and the Marqui&s;ate of</HI> Trevi&s;ana <HI>in the</HI> Venetian <HI>State. The North part of it, or bottom, hath</HI> Fri|uli <HI>for its bounds, the North-East is limited by</HI> I&s;tria, Dalmatia, Albania, <HI>and</HI> Epirus: <HI>whereof</HI> I&s;tria <HI>doth not &s;o entirely belong unto the</HI> Venetians, <HI>but that the Arch-Duke of</HI> Gratz <HI>of the Au&s;trian family, who at this pre&s;ent is Emperor, doth po&s;&s;e&s;s divers Ma|ritim towns therein. In</HI> Dalmatia, <HI>&s;aving</HI> Zura, Spalato, <HI>and</HI> Cattaro, <HI>they have nothing of impor|tance, the re&s;t belonging to the Republick of</HI> Ragu&s;a, <HI>and to the Turks. In</HI> Albania <HI>and</HI> Epirus, <HI>they po&s;|&s;e&s;s nothing at all, it beeing entirely the Turk's. So that hee, who &s;hall examine the circuit of this &s;ea, which must contain above 1200 miles, &s;hall finde the &s;hores of the</HI> Venetian <HI>&s;ignorie, not to take up intire 200 of them, omitting &s;om &s;catter'd towns and di&s;per&s;ed I&s;lands, lying on the Turki&s;h &s;ide of the Adriatick &s;hore. For the &s;ecuring hereof from the depredation of Pirates, and the preten&s;es of divers Potent Prin|ces, as the Pope, Emperor, King of</HI> Spain, <HI>and the great Turk; who have each of them large territories lying thereupon, al&s;o to cau&s; all &s;uch &s;hips, as navigate the &s;ame, to go to</HI> Venice, <HI>and there to pay cu&s;tom and other duties, the Republick maintain's continually in action a great number of &s;hips, gallies and galliots,
<PB REF="3"> whereto they al&s;o add more, as there may bee occa&s;ion, whereof &s;om lie about the bottom of the Gulph in</HI> I&s;tria, <HI>others about the I&s;lands of</HI> Dalmatia, <HI>to clear tho&s;e parts of Pirates, who have much infested tho&s;e &s;eas: others, and tho&s;e of most force, have their &s;tati|ons in the I&s;land of</HI> Corfu, <HI>and in that of</HI> Candie: <HI>in the first of which commonly re&s;ide's the Captain of the Gulph, whom they call by the name of</HI> Proveditor, <HI>or</HI> Provi&s;or general, <HI>who&s;e office it is to &s;ecure the Navigation of the Gulph not onely from the</HI> Cor&s;ari <HI>or Pirates, but to provide that neither the gallies nor &s;hips of the Pope, the King of</HI> Spain, <HI>or great Turk, do &s;o much as enter the &s;ame, without permi&s;sion of the Signorie, or Republick, and upon &s;uch conditions as be&s;t plea&s;eth them; which they are &s;o careful to effect, as in the year 1638 the Turki&s;h fleet entring the Gulph without licen&s;, was a&s;&s;ailed by the Venetian General, who &s;unk divers of their ve&s;sels, and compelling the re&s;t to flie unto</HI> Valona, <HI>hee held them there be&s;ieged, al|though the &s;ame citie, and Port whereon it &s;tand's, bee under the jurisdiction of the Grand Signor And not|with&s;tanding that a great and dangerous war was like|ly to en&s;ue thereupon, betwixt the Grand-Signor and the Republick, becau&s; the Venetian General, bee|ing not content to have chaced them into their own
<PB REF="4"> Ports, did moreover then that, &s;ink their ve&s;sels, &amp; land|ing his men, &s;lew divers of their mariners who had e&s;ca|ped his furie at &s;ea: yet after that a very honorable peace was again concluded betwixt them, wherein, amongst other things, it was agreed, that it &s;hould bee lawful for the</HI> Venetians, <HI>as often as any Turki&s;h ve&s;&s;els did without their licence enter the Gulph, to &s;eiz upon them by force, if they would not otherwi&s;e obey. And that it &s;hould likewi&s;e bee lawful for them &s;o to do, within any haven, or under any fort of the Grand-Signor's, bordering on any part of the Venetian Gulph. Out of all which, when I con&s;idered the real and ab&s;olute &s;ove|reigntie, which this Republick doth actually enjoy over this &s;ea, which they have ever defended, as well by the &s;word as the pen; and withal how that &s;om neighbor|ing Nations of late years, did &s;eem to envie the title of</HI> England <HI>to the narrow &s;eas, affirming in &s;om of their writings, the</HI> Sea to bee free; <HI>that</HI> it neither ought, nor could bee under the juri&s;diction of any; <HI>that</HI> it was a wilde bea&s;t which could not bee ruled; <HI>that,</HI> po&s;&s;e&s;sio <HI>beeing</HI> Pedis po&s;itio, <HI>there</HI> could no po&s;&s;e&s;sion bee either taken or kept of it; <HI>that</HI> the limits thereof, beeing a fluent element, could not bee &s;cored out, <HI>or</HI> certainly determined; <HI>that</HI> it was as free for all mankinde to u&s;e, &amp; as common as the
<PB REF="4"> a&euml;r, <HI>with many other things to that purpo&s;e; I chancing &s;om years pa&s;t to bee at</HI> Venice, <HI>upon con&s;ideration of the premi&s;&s;es, did labor with a great de&s;ire, to know the grounds of that title, whereupon the</HI> Venetians <HI>found|ed their</HI> Dominion of the &s;ea; <HI>and after much &s;earch, even to the de&s;pair of obteining of it, I happened upon this en&s;uing argument, containing a</HI> Plea <HI>or</HI> Di&s;pute, <HI>betwixt the</HI> Au&s;trians <HI>and</HI> Venetians, <HI>touching the</HI> Dominion of the Adriatick Sea, <HI>not fictitious or devi|&s;ed onely to color the cau&s;, but faithfully tran&s;cribed from out the publick Regi&s;ters of that citie, which I offer herewith to the Reader in Engli&s;h, and withall the&s;e two con&s;iderations.</HI></P>
<P>Fir&s;t, <HI>that hereby it will appear, that the Common|wealth of</HI> England'<HI>s challenge to the dominion of the &s;ea, is neither a Noveltie or &s;ingularitie; e&s;pecially, when it is be&s;ides mo&s;t apparant that the King of</HI> Den|mark, <HI>doth not onely pretend to the Sovereigntie of the Sound, but cau&s;eth all &s;uch &s;hips as pa&s;s through it, to pay what toll hee plea&s;eth. The great Turk prohibit's all Nations, &s;aving his own va&s;&s;als, to enter the black &s;ea, or</HI> Pontus Euxinus; <HI>the like hee doth to the red &s;ea, which contein's at the lea&s;t 1200 miles in length, be|ginning from the &s;treits of</HI> Babelmondel, <HI>which give's entrance thereinto, and ending at the tower of</HI> Sues,
<PB REF="5"> <HI>which is &s;eated at the bottom thereof. The King of</HI> Portugal <HI>oppo&s;eth to the utmo&s;t of his power, any, but his own &s;ubjects to &s;ail into the Ea&s;t Indies, affirming tho&s;e &s;eas to bee intirely under his dominion, as well by con|quest, as the Pope's donation, in&s;omuch, as the &s;malle&s;t ve&s;&s;el, even of the natives of tho&s;e parts, cannot &s;ail from port to port, without the pa&s;sport of the</HI> Vice-Roy of Goa, <HI>or of &s;om other by him deputed thereto, &s;tyling him&s;elf, amongst other his titles, to bee King of the conque&s;t, navigation, and commerce, or traffick of</HI> Aethiopia, Arabia, Per&s;ia, India, <HI>&amp;c. which hath been hitherto &s;o punctually ob&s;erved, as no</HI> Ca&s;ti|lian, <HI>or Spaniard, might at any time, or for any occa&s;ion, &s;ail into the Ea&s;t Indies, though both tho&s;e Nati|ons were for many years together united under one King.</HI></P>
<P>Secondly, <HI>if the Dominion of the&s;e &s;eas do truely and properly belong to the Commonwealth of</HI> England <HI>(as hath been &s;o &s;ufficiently cleared and proved to the whole world, by that learned book entituled</HI> Mare Clau&s;um) <HI>why may not, or ought not the People of</HI> England, <HI>by all lawful waies procure, that the Domi|nion of the&s;e Seas that &s;o ju&s;tly appertein's unto them, may be &s;ecured from any force, violence, or oppo&s;ition, how great &s;oever, of their mo&s;t powerful neighbors;
<PB REF="5"> whenas wee &s;ee the</HI> Venetians <HI>to bee &s;o jealous in pre|&s;ervation of the title they pretend to their Seas, as ra|ther then to &s;uffer it to bee in the lea&s;t &s;ort que&s;tioned, they do upon all occa&s;ions oppo&s;e them&s;elvs by force, or otherwi&s;e, again&s;t the most potent Princes of</HI> Europe <HI>and</HI> A&s;ia. <HI>Vale.</HI></P>

<HEAD><HI>Dominium Maris:</HI> Or, The Dominion of the Sea.</HEAD>
<P>_AFter a long peace, betwixt the progenitors of the Emperor <HI>Maximilian</HI> the fir&s;t, and the Republick of <HI>Venice,</HI> in the year 1508, there began certain &s;light differences, which concluded in a notable, and mo&s;t memorable war: in&s;omuch as the Republick, for 22 years following, were with the &s;aid Prince, and with his po&s;teritie, for divers re&s;pects, &s;om|times in war, &s;omtimes in peace, and &s;omtimes in truce, until in the year 1529 all differences betwixt them were compo&s;ed, and a peace concluded in <HI>Bolonia,</HI> which continued all that age, with the Emperor <HI>Charls</HI> the fifth, together with his brother <HI>Ferdinando</HI> King of <HI>Hungarie,</HI> and Archduke of <HI>Au&s;tria.</HI> But be|cau&s; by the divi&s;ion, made betwixt the &s;aid brethren, &s;even years before, all the <HI>Au&s;trian</HI> lands which confined with the <HI>Ve|netians,</HI> were laid by agreement unto the part which belonged unto King <HI>Ferdinand,</HI> the confines of which as they had conjun|cture with the lands of the Republick, were very intricate; and of great difficultie to conclude, unto whether partie they did be|long,
<PB N="2" REF="7"> as well for the publick rea&s;ons of the &s;aid Princes, as for tho&s;e of their private &s;ubjects; To end all which in quiet, it was agreed that there &s;hould bee an arbitrarie Tribunal erected in <HI>Trent,</HI> for the deciding of the&s;e doubts, which in the year 1535, pronounced &s;entence, whereby all the differences (beeing more then an hundred) were definitively concluded.</P>
<P>Here notwith&s;tanding the difficultie cea&s;ed not, becau&s; &s;om did traver&s; the execution of the &s;entence, &s;o, as in progre&s;s of time, new quarrels did ari&s;e from both &s;ides, each one pretend|ing new wrongs offered by the adver&s; partie. Whereupon to put an end to all the&s;e differences, there was by the common con&s;ent, as well of <HI>Ferdinando</HI> (who &s;ucceeded in the Empire by the re&s;ignation of his brother) as of the Republick, a convention appointed in <HI>Friuli</HI> 1563, of five Commi&s;&s;aries, one Procurator, and three Advocates, for each part, who &s;hould treat of the dif|ferences, as well old as new, and &s;hould have power to conclude them, under the ratification of the &s;everal Princes. And this &s;o great a number of Judges, was de&s;ired by the Emperor, the better to give &s;atisfaction to his &s;ubjects, of &s;everal provinces, intere&s;sed in the cau&s;.</P>
<P>Of the Imperial &s;ide, the Commi&s;saries were <HI>Andrew Preghel</HI> a Baron of Au&s;tria, <HI>Maximilian Dorimbergh, Elenger de Goritia, Ste|phen Sourz,</HI> and <HI>Anthonie Statemberger:</HI> the Procurator was, <HI>Gia|como Campana,</HI> Chancellor of <HI>Goritia:</HI> the Doctors or Advocates were <HI>Andrea Rapicio, Gerva&s;io Alberto,</HI> and <HI>Giovan Maria Gratia Dei.</HI> For the Venetians the Commi&s;saries were, <HI>Sebastian Venier, Marino de Cavalli, Pietro Sanudo, Giovan Baptista Contarini,</HI> and <HI>Au|gu&s;tin Barbarigo:</HI> The Procurator was, <HI>Giovan Antonio</HI> a &s;ecretarie: the Advocates <HI>Marquardo Su&s;anna, France&s;co Gratiano,</HI> and <HI>Giacomo Chizzola.</HI></P>
<P>At this Convention the complaints on both &s;ides were opened,
<PB N="3" REF="7"> which beeing argued, and the other publick differences partly compo&s;ed, and partly decided, there was taken into con&s;idera|tion a Petition of the Imperial Procurator, in this form, <HI>Eju&s;dem Maje&s;tatis nomine requiritur, ut posthac illius &s;ubditis, atque aliis in &s;inu Adriatico tut&ograve; navigare, ac negotiari liceat. Item ut damna, Tergestinis Mercatoribus at que aliis illata, restituantur.</HI> It is required in the name of his Maje&s;tie, that hereafter it may be lawful for his &s;ubjects, and others, to traffick and navigate &s;afely in the Adriatick Gulph. Likewi&s;e that recompence bee made for the damages &s;u&s;teined by the merchants of <HI>Trie&s;te,</HI> and others. And <HI>Rapicio</HI> the advo|cate did accompanie this demand with &s;aying; that <HI>this was not a cau&s; to bee handled with any &s;ubtiltie, it beeing a thing mo&s;t notorious, that navigation ought to bee free, notwithstanding the &s;ubjects of his Maje|&s;t&igrave;e had been constrained to go with their &s;hips to</HI> Venice, <HI>and there to pay cu&s;tom, at which his Majest&igrave;e was aggrieved, and made instance that it might bee remedied.</HI></P>
<P>To this <HI>Chizzola</HI> Advocate of the Republick made an&s;wer, &s;aying, that it was a clear ca&s;e indeed, that Navigation ought to bee free, but yet tho&s;e things, whereat they were aggrieved, were no waies repugnant to this freedom; fora&s;much as in countries which are mo&s;t free, tho&s;e who have the dominion thereof re|ceiv <HI>cu&s;tom,</HI> and order by which way all merchandi&s;e &s;hall pa&s;s; and therefore no bodie &s;hould bee grieved, if the <HI>Venetians,</HI> for their own re&s;pects, did u&s;e &s;o to do in the Adriatick Sea, which is under their dominion; and hee added, that if they intended to di&s;pute of the bu&s;ine&s;s in que&s;tion, hee was to adverti&s;e them, that this cau&s; could not by any preten&s; bee brought into judg|ment, at that convention, which was onely in&s;tituted, for the execution of &s;uch things as were formerly &s;entenced and for righting of &s;uch new wrongs, which &s;ucceeded after the &s;en|tence; it beeing be&s;ides a thing mo&s;t notorious, that the <HI>Re|publick,</HI>
<PB N="4" REF="8"> as Lord of the Adriatick Sea, did exerci&s;e that dominion at the pre&s;ent, which from time out of minde, it had alwaies don, without any interruption, as well in receiving of cu&s;toms, as in a&s;signing of places for the exaction of it, and that the pre|ten&s; now alleged was new, and never before u&s;ed by any pre|dece&s;&s;or of the Emperor, either as King of <HI>Hungarie,</HI> or as Arch|duke of <HI>Austria,</HI> or the countries thereto adjacent, or of his Ma|je&s;tie then being, for many years, until this pre&s;ent time. Hee chal|lenged the Imperiali&s;ts to &s;hew, when ever any &s;uch thing was before pretended; certainly not before the peace of <HI>Bolonia;</HI> for then &s;uch a difference as this (if there had been any &s;uch) had been there determined, or referred over to the Arbitrarie Tribu|nal, wherein were handled above 120 controver&s;ies, but of this not any mention made, neither, from that time to this, was there any &s;uch preten&s;ion once &s;et a foot. But if this were a new wrong, &s;ucceeding after the &s;entence of <HI>Trent,</HI> they &s;hould &s;hew what it was, and when it had beginning, becau&s; hee was pre|pared to &s;hew unto them, that any thing concerning the &s;ame, was of mo&s;t ancient u&s;e and continuance, without the lea&s;t no|veltie in the world; and therefore they ought not to bee heard, who came with demands, which could take no original either from the &s;entence of <HI>Trent,</HI> or from any innovation of wrongs &s;ucceeding thereupon.</P>
<P>To this <HI>Rapicio</HI> replied, thathee intended not to lay his principal foundation upon that, which to all is &s;o well known, which is to &s;ay, <HI>that the Sea is common and free,</HI> and that by rea&s;on thereof, not any might bee prohibited, to &s;ail unto any place, which be&s;t plea&s;ed him: and if any Doctors &s;hould happen to &s;ay, that the Republick hath a pre&s;cript dominion over the Adriatick Sea, with a long po&s;&s;e&s;sion, notwith&s;tanding they prove it not: and to Doctors who affirm a thing barely out of fact, without any
<PB N="5" REF="8"> manner of proof, little belief is to bee given; for which cau&s;, hee would not dwell upon that, but would com to his principal rea&s;on, which was, that admitting the Republick to bee Patron of the Sea, yet the Emperor's &s;ubjects might navigate freely by the capitulations, which were e&s;tabli&s;hed betwixt the Princes on both &s;ides, and therefore the Petition propo&s;ed was pertinent to bee handled by the &s;aid Convention; to which (hee beeing &s;o required by the <HI>Venetians)</HI> added this for a foundation, <HI>Quia li|bera navigatio Maris Adriat&igrave;c&icirc; c&ugrave;m Maje&s;tatis &s;uae Cae&s;areae, tum &s;ubdito|rum damno &amp; incommodo, ab Illu&s;tri&s;simi Domini Veneti triremium Prae|fectis impedita fuerit, contra Capitula Vormatiae, Bononiae, Andegavi, &amp; Venetiis inita:</HI> Fora&s;much as the free navigation of the Adriatick Sea, hath been hindred by the Captains of the Venetian's Gallies, to the lo&s;s and prejudice of his Imperial Maje&s;tie, and of his &s;ubjects, again&s;t the Capitulations of <HI>Worms, Bolonia, Angiers,</HI> and <HI>Venice.</HI> And here hee produced a pa&s;&s;age of the Capitulation of <HI>Bolonia</HI> which &s;pake as followeth; <HI>Quod communes &s;ubditi liber&egrave;, tut&egrave;, &amp; &s;ecur&egrave; po&s;sint in utriu&s;que &s;tatibus &amp; dominiis tam terr&acirc;, qu&agrave;m Mari, morar&igrave; &amp; negotiari cum bonis &s;u&igrave;s, ac &s;i e&s;&s;ent incolae, &amp; &s;ubditi il|lius Principis, ac Dominii, cujus patrias, &amp; Dominia adibunt; prov&igrave;dia|t&uacute;rque, n&egrave; vis aut aliqua injuria, ulla de cau&s;a, eis inferatur, celerit&eacute;rque jus administretur.</HI> That the &s;ubjects of either partie may freely, &s;afely, and &s;ecurely abide, and traffick with their goods, in the States and Dominions of one another, in like manner as if they were inhabitants, and &s;ubjects of that Prince and State, into who&s;e countrie or Dominion they do com: and that it bee pro|vided, that no violence or injurie, bee for any cau&s; what&s;o&ecirc;ver offered them, and moreover that ju&s;tice be &s;peedily admini&s;tred. Hee al&s;o recited the capitulations of the truce of <HI>Angiers</HI> and <HI>Worms,</HI> and of the peace of <HI>Venice,</HI> which is not nece&s;&s;arie here to repeat, beeing of the &s;ame tenor. Hee did re&s;t much up|on
<PB N="6" REF="9"> the word <HI>liber&egrave;,</HI> con&s;idering that <HI>liber&egrave;</HI> is joined to the word <HI>Navigare:</HI> by which it ought to bee under&s;tood, according to the common con&s;truction of law, <HI>that everie one might navigate freely;</HI> but hee cannot bee &s;aid to bee <HI>free,</HI> who is con&s;trained to go to <HI>Venice.</HI> Hee added moreover, that the word <HI>liber&egrave;</HI> could not bee imagined to bee &s;uperfluous, but mu&s;t of nece&s;sitie ope|rate &s;omthing; that the two words, <HI>tut&egrave; &amp; &s;ecur&egrave;,</HI> could im|port nothing el&s;, but without impediment, or mole&s;tation, or paying of cu&s;toms; to this hee added, that there were then 400 complaints of his Maje&s;tie's &s;ubjects, who&s;e ve&s;&s;els were com|pelled to go to <HI>Venice,</HI> and there made to pay cu&s;tom, for happen|ing onely to arrive in the ports of the <HI>Venetians,</HI> either by fortune or &s;om other occa&s;ion. Hee read the &s;entence of a Rector of <HI>Lie&s;ina,</HI> who freed a &s;hip, which touched upon that I&s;land by chance; and hee made a narration, that certain barks with &s;alt were &s;uffred, by the Venetian fleet, to pa&s;s upon their voiage, without &s;ending them to <HI>Venice.</HI> Hee concluded that his reque&s;t extended to the&s;e three points. 1. That the <HI>Au&s;trian</HI> &s;ubjects might Navigate whither it plea&s;ed them. 2. That arriving in any port of the Republick, onely <HI>per tran&s;itum,</HI> they &s;hould not pay any thing. 3. <HI>La&s;tly,</HI> that coming to trade in any of them, they &s;hould not pay more, then the &s;ubjects of the Re|publick.</P>

And re&s;erving him&s;elf, to &s;peak of the Dominion of the Sea afterwards, how&s;oever pre&s;uppo&s;ing it in the fir&s;t place, hee began with the Capitula|tions; and <HI>fir&s;t</HI> hee &s;aid, that the word, <HI>liber&egrave;,</HI> was not joined
<PB N="7" REF="9"> as <HI>Rapicio</HI> &s;aid, to any &s;uch word as <HI>Navigare,</HI> but to the words <HI>Morari &amp; negotiari tam terr&acirc;, qu&agrave;m Mari:</HI> and therefore by <HI>liber&egrave;</HI> is to bee under&s;tood as the common con&s;truction of Law in|tend's, when one doth either dwell, or do bu&s;ine&s;s in the hou&s;, or land of another, that is to &s;ay, ob&s;erving the laws, and pay|ing the rights of the countrie. Hee added al&s;o, that tho&s;e Capi|tulations, betwixt the hou&s; of <HI>Austria,</HI> and the <HI>Republick,</HI> were equally reciprocal, and not made more in favor of the <HI>Au&s;trians</HI> in the State of the <HI>Venetians,</HI> then of the <HI>Venetians</HI> in the State of the <HI>Au&s;trians;</HI> neither was there greater libertie granted to the Sea, then to the Land; and that the words were clear enough, which import, that the &s;ubjects on both &s;ides might &s;tay, trade, and merchandi&s;e, in the State of one another, as well by Land as by Sea, and bee well intreated; In&s;omuch as the &s;ubjects of the <HI>Venetians,</HI> were to have no le&s;s libertie in the Lands of the <HI>Au&s;trians,</HI> then the <HI>Austrian</HI> &s;ubjects in the Sea of <HI>Venice;</HI> And that by virtue of tho&s;e words, what his Maje&s;tie would have in the State of the <HI>Republick,</HI> it is fitting that hee allow to them in his own State; and if his Imperial Maje&s;tie within his own State, upon the Land, will not yield that the &s;ubjects of the <HI>Re|publick</HI> &s;hall go which way they li&s;t, but con&s;train's them to pa&s;s by &s;uch places onely, where Cu&s;tom is to bee paid, hee cannot with ju&s;tice demand, that his &s;ubjects may pa&s;s by or through the Sea of the <HI>Republick</HI> which way they li&s;t, but ought to con|tent him&s;elf, that they go that way onely, which &s;hall be&s;t &s;tand with the commoditie of tho&s;e who have the dominion over it; and if his Maje&s;tie cau&s; cu&s;tom to bee paid, upon <HI>his</HI> Land, why may not the <HI>Venetians</HI> likewi&s;e do it, upon <HI>their</HI> Sea? Hee demanded of them, if by the Capitulation they would have it, that the Emperor was re&s;trained, or hindred, from taking of cu&s;tom? and if not, why would they have the <HI>Venetians</HI>
<PB N="8" REF="10"> tied thereunto by a Capitulation, which &s;peak's of both Poten|tates equally with the &s;ame words? Hee &s;hewed by a particular narration, that from the Peace of <HI>Venice</HI> 1523. until that pre&s;ent, the Emperor had increa&s;ed his cu&s;toms, to the grievance of the <HI>Venetian</HI> &s;ubjects, in victuals and merchandi&s;e, which pa&s;&s;ed from the one State unto the other; in&s;omuch as that which formerly paied but one, was now increa&s;ed in &s;om to 16, and in others to 20. and hee in&s;tanced in iron and other commodities, which were wont to pay little or nothing, were now rai&s;ed to &s;uch an exce&s;sive cu&s;tom, as proved much to the damage of the <HI>Venetians;</HI> be&s;ides they were forced to pa&s;s onely by &s;uch places, where they &s;hould pay cu&s;tom, out of which to pa&s;s, it was <HI>Contra banda,</HI> and their goods confi&s;cated. And if his Maje&s;tie think's it law|ful to do what it plea&s;eth within his own e&s;tate, without break|ing of the Capitulations, hee cannot think that the <HI>Venetians</HI> do|ing but the &s;ame, &s;hould contrarie thereunto, any waies offend. Hee added, that in every Peace e&s;tabli&s;hed betwixt two Princes, after a war, it is nece&s;&s;arie that their &s;ubjects may live and trade together, not to the excluding of cu&s;toms, although there bee excluded the violences, ho&s;tilities, and other impediments of trade, which were formerly u&s;ed in time of war, neither is the autoritie of the one, or other Prince, thereby taken away or re|&s;trained by Sea or by Land.</P>
<P>At the force and clearne&s;s of this di&s;cour&s;, the <HI>Au&s;trians</HI> re|mained as it were in a trance, looking one upon another, in&s;o|much that <HI>Chizzola</HI> judging it not to bee nece&s;&s;arie to dwell lon|ger upon this, pa&s;&s;ed to the proof of the pre&s;uppo&s;ed truth, viz. <HI>That the Republick had the Dominion of the Sea,</HI> and &s;aid; that the propo&s;ition was mo&s;t true, that the Sea was common and free, but yet no otherwi&s;e that could bee under&s;tood, then as it is com|monly &s;aid, The high waies are common and free, by which is
<PB N="9" REF="10"> meant, that they cannot bee u&s;urped by any private per&s;on, for his &s;ole proper &s;ervice, but remain to the u&s;e of every one: not therefore that they are &s;o free, as that they &s;hould not bee under the protection and government of &s;om Prince, and that every one might do therein licentiou&s;ly, all that which it plea&s;ed him, either by right or wrong; fora&s;much as &s;uch licentiou&s;ne&s;s or Anarchie is abhorred both of God and nature, as well by Sea as by Land. That the true libertie of the Sea, exclude's it not from the protection and &s;uperioritie of &s;uch as maintain it in libertie, nor from the &s;ubjection to the laws of &s;uch, as have command over it, rather nece&s;&s;arily it include's it. That no le&s;s the Sea, then the Land, is &s;ubject to bee divided among&s;t men, and ap|propriated to cities and Potentates, which long &s;ince was or|dained by God from the beginning of mankinde, as a thing mo&s;t natual; which was well under&s;tood by <HI>Ari&s;totle,</HI> when hee &s;aid, that unto Sea or maritim cities, the Sea is the territorie, becau&s; from thence they take their &s;u&s;tenance and defence; a thing which cannot po&s;sibly bee, unle&s;s part of it might bee appropriated in the like manner as the Land is, which is divided betwixt cities and governments, not by equal parts, nor according to their greatne&s;s, but as they have been, or are able to rule, govern, and defend them. <HI>Berne</HI> is not the great|e&s;t citie of <HI>Switzerland,</HI> and yet it hath as large a territorie, as all the re&s;t of the twelv Cantons together. And the citie of <HI>No|rimberg</HI> is very great, and yet the territories thereof, hardly exceed the walls. And the citie of <HI>Venice</HI> for many years was known to bee without any po&s;&s;e&s;sion at all upon the firm Land. Upon the Sea likewi&s;e, certain cities of great force and valor have po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a large quantitie thereof, others of little force, have been contented with the next waters; neither are there want|ing examples of &s;uch, who notwith&s;tanding they are Maritim,
<PB N="10" REF="11"> yet having fertile lands lying on the back of them, have been contented therewith, without ever attempting to gain any Sea|dominion; Others, who beeing aw'd by their more mightie neighbors, have been con&s;trained to forbear any &s;uch attempt; for which two cau&s;es, a citie, notwith&s;tanding it bee Maritim, may happen to remain without any po&s;&s;e&s;sion of the Sea.</P>
<P>Hee added that God did in&s;titute Principalities, for the main|teinance of Ju&s;tice, to the benefit of mankinde, which was ne|ce&s;&s;arie to be executed, as well by Sea as by Land. That S. Paul &s;aid, that <HI>for this cau&s; there was due to Princes, customs and contribu|tions:</HI> that it &s;hould bee a great ab&s;urditie to prai&s;e the well go|verning, regulating, and defence of the Land, and to condemn that of the Sea: that if the Sea in &s;om parts for the amplene&s;s and extreme di&s;tance thereof from the Land, was not po&s;sible to bee governed and protected, that proceeded from a di&s;abilitie and defect in mankinde; as al&s;o there are de&s;erts &s;o great upon the Land, as it is impo&s;sible to protect them; witne&s;s the ma|ny &s;andie parts of <HI>Africa,</HI> and the immen&s; va&s;tities of the new world. And as it is a gift of God; that a Land by the laws and publick power, bee ruled, protected and governed, &s;o the &s;ame happen's to the Sea: that tho&s;e were deceived by a gro&s;s equi|vocation, who &s;aid, that the Land by rea&s;on of its &s;tabilitie might bee governed, but not the Sea, for beeing an uncon&s;tant element, no more then the a&ecirc;r; fora&s;much as if, by the Sea and the a&ecirc;r, they intend all the parts of tho&s;e fluent elements; it is a mo&s;t certain thing, that they cannot bee governed, becau&s;e, whil&s;t a man &s;erv's him&s;elf with any one part of them, the other e&s;cape's out of his power; but this chanceth al&s;o to rivers, which can|not bee reteined. But when it is &s;aid to rule over a Sea or river, it is not under&s;tood of the Element, but of the &s;ite, where they are placed. The water of the <HI>Adriatick</HI> Sea continually run's out of it,
<PB N="11" REF="11"> neither can it all bee kept in, and yet it is the &s;ame Sea, as well as the <HI>Tiber, Po,</HI> or the <HI>Rhine</HI> are the &s;ame rivers now, which they were 1000 years pa&s;t. And this is that which is &s;ubject to the protection of Princes.</P>
<P>Hee asked the <HI>Austrians</HI> if their preten&s; were, that the Sea &s;hould bee left without protection, &s;o that any one might do therein well or ill, robbing, &s;poiling, and making of it unnavi|gable; this would bee &s;o ab&s;urd, as hee dur&s;t an&s;wer for them, <HI>no:</HI> therefore hee concluded, that by a nece&s;&s;arie con&s;equence his Maje&s;tie would acknowledg, that it &s;hould bee kept, go|verned and protected by tho&s;e unto whom it did appertain by divine di&s;po&s;ition: which if it were &s;o, hee de&s;ired to know, if it &s;eemed to them a ju&s;t thing that &s;uch &s;hould do it, with the expence of their own pains, charges, and bloud; or rather that &s;uch &s;hould contribute towards it, who did equally enjoy the benefit: To this al&s;o hee dur&s;t an&s;wer for them, that they would &s;ay the doctrine of S^t Paul is too clear in the point (not to allege matter of law) that <HI>all &s;uch who are under govern|ment and protection, are thereby bound to pay customs and contributions.</HI> And thereupon hee concluded, that if the Republick were that Prince, to whom it did appertain to govern and protect the Adriatick Sea, it followed nece&s;&s;arily, that who&s;oever Navigate's it, ought to bee &s;ubject to their laws, in the &s;ame manner as &s;uch are, who travel through a countrie upon the Land.</P>
<P>From thence hee went on to &s;hew, that this Dominion over the Sea, from time out of minde, did belong to the Republick, and thereupon cau&s;ed to bee read out of an Ab&s;tract which hee had taken, the opinions of thirtie Lawyers, whom from the year 1300, until that pre&s;ent time, did &s;peak of the Dominion which the Republick had over the Sea, as of a thing mo&s;t no|torious, and of which, even in their times, the minde of man
<PB N="12" REF="12"> knew not the contrarie: &s;om of them affirming, that the Re|publick had no le&s;s Dominion over the Sea, then over the citie of <HI>Venice;</HI> others &s;aying, that the Adriatick Sea is the territorie and demea&s;nes of the &s;aid citie, making mention of the lawful power which the <HI>Venetians</HI> had to e&s;tabli&s;h laws over Navigati|on, and to impo&s;e cu&s;toms upon &s;uch as navigate tho&s;e Seas; and hee added that hee never read any Lawyer, which ever &s;aid the contrarie. And turning him&s;elf to <HI>Rapicio</HI> hee &s;aid, that if hee would not believ tho&s;e writers which te&s;tified that the Sea be|longed to the <HI>Venetians,</HI> whereof they had po&s;&s;e&s;sion from time out of minde, before the age wherein the Autors lived, although they prove it not, yet hee could not denie to receiv them for te&s;ti|monies of &s;uch things which they &s;aw and knew in their times, and to hold them as witne&s;&s;es, far above all exception, beeing fa|mous men, and dead &s;o many years ago, as they could not bee any waies intere&s;&s;ed in the pre&s;ent differences. And becau&s; more then 250 years were pa&s;t, from the time that the fir&s;t Autors, which hee alleged as witne&s;&s;es hereof did write, to the time of tho&s;e, which hee la&s;t cited in that behalf; by their atte&s;tation it was &s;ufficiently proved, that for long time more then &s;o many years, the Republick hath commanded the Sea, and therefore hee could not denie the immemorable po&s;&s;e&s;sion thereof to the pre|&s;ent.</P>
<P>Afterwards turning him&s;elf to the Judges, hee praied them, that upon the autorities alleged, they would bee plea&s;ed to li&s;ten unto a &s;hort con&s;ideration of his, which hee did not doubt, but would leav in them a full impre&s;sion of the truth. And <HI>fir&s;t</HI> hee de&s;ired them to con&s;ider, that notwith&s;tanding &s;om of the afore|&s;aid cited Autors &s;peak with general words, &s;aying, the &s;ea of the <HI>Venetians,</HI> neither declaring the qualitie nor quantitie thereof; yet others do &s;pecifie it, u&s;ing the name of the <HI>Gulph;</HI> and others with
<PB N="13" REF="12"> terms more expre&s;sive, &s;aying, the <HI>Adriatick Sea;</HI> which clearly demon&s;trate's, not onely the &s;ite, but al&s;o the quantitie of the Sea po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed; and &s;o &s;hewed, that tho&s;e who &s;peak more expre&s;|&s;ively, ought to clear the pa&s;&s;ages of tho&s;e, who write more ge|nerally, according to the common precept, that <HI>with clear places the more ob&s;cure are to bee illu&s;trated.</HI> Hee con&s;idered al&s;o, that the divers manner of &s;peaking of the &s;ame Doctors, &s;om de|riving the Dominion of the Republick over the Sea, from cu|&s;tom, &s;om from pre&s;cription, others from an induced &s;ubjection, and others from a privilege, did ari&s;e all out of this rea&s;on, be|cau&s;e as they were mo&s;t a&s;&s;uredly informed of the po&s;&s;e&s;sion and juri&s;diction of the &s;aid Seas, which they both &s;aw and heard to belong to the Republick from time out of minde; &s;o they wri|ting upon that matter, not at the in&s;tance of any one, but of their own proper motions, and by way of doctrine onely, each one of them judged it mo&s;t convenient to expre&s;s the title of that juri&s;diction, &s;om with one term, &s;om with another, with|out coming to u&s;e the &s;ole true and proper term, as they would have don, if they had been put to write for the intere&s;t of any one; in which ca&s;es the Coun&s;ellors are alwaies conformable, receiving from the per&s;on intere&s;ted equally the like in&s;tru|ctions.</P>
<P>Hee added, that through the varietie of expre&s;sing them&s;elvs, the truth of the cau&s; was no waies dimini&s;hed, but rather in|crea&s;ed; as S. <HI>Augu&s;tine</HI> &s;aith, &s;peaking of the diver&s;itie which is ob&s;erved to bee betwixt the holy Evangeli&s;ts; becau&s;e by the diver&s; manner of expre&s;sion, u&s;ed by the &s;aid writers, every one may re&s;t a&s;&s;ured, that none of them did write <HI>n&egrave; pagato, n&egrave; pre|gato,</HI> neither paied, nor praied. In which ca&s;es they are never wont to varie, from the &s;ingle form pre&s;cribed unto them by the partie intere&s;&s;ed, but rather hee that &s;hall well examine it, &s;hall
<PB N="14" REF="13"> &s;ee among&s;t the Doctors a wonderful concord in this one point mo&s;t true, that after the declination of the Con&s;tantinopolitan Empire, the Adriatick Sea was found to bee for many years abandoned, (as al&s;o many I&s;lands and cities of that State) in &s;uch manner, as it remained unguarded and without the protection and government of any Prince, and under the juri&s;diction of no bodie, until by the <HI>Venetians,</HI> who, to receiv their livelyhood thereby, were con&s;trained to maintain it in freedom; and there|upon taking it into their protection, got thereby the govern|ment and dominion over it, in like manner as by the law of na|ture and of Nations, the Land, the Sea, and other things, which are not under the Dominion of any other, com ju&s;tly unto tho&s;e who fir&s;t get the po&s;&s;e&s;sion of them; by which rea&s;on the fir&s;t Empires were founded, as well upon the Land as at Sea, and daily there are new ones in the &s;ame manner formed, when any of them, either through age or vice, becoming weak, wanteth force, and &s;ink's of it &s;elf. The which cu&s;todie and government of the Sea, &s;o acquired, the Republick hath daily advanced, by the keeping of potent fleets and greater Armadoes every day then other, with the expence of a great deal of trea|&s;ure, and the profu&s;ion of a world of bloud, both of their Citizens and &s;ubjects, continuing without interruption, in &s;ight of all the world, the &s;aid begun Dominion and cu&s;todie, over|coming and removing all &s;uch impediments, as either by Pirates or Potentates, as well of <HI>Italie</HI> as of the oppo&s;ite &s;hore, at divers times have been rai&s;ed. And for the clearing of &s;uch doubts, as might ari&s;e by the &s;ubtil con&s;truction of words, hee added; that although tho&s;e who took upon them to &s;peak in the &s;trict terms of the Law, were wont to &s;ay, that &s;uch things onely were gained by cu&s;tom, which by the civil law, beeing to bee com|mon, were notwith&s;tanding converted to a private benefit, yet
<PB N="15" REF="13"> without any impeachment of the publick profit, as to fi&s;h in a river without impeachment of Navigation: yet for all that, the title of cu&s;tom cannot bee unproperly given, where there &s;hall bee gained and continually kept in po&s;&s;e&s;sion and Domini|on, a quantitie either of Sea or Land abandoned, and of no man po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, as <HI>Bartholus, Baldus, Castro,</HI> and others do affirm.

<PB N="16" REF="14">
<P>Now as touching the <HI>Privilege</HI> of keeping this Sea, and who was the Donor, this neither can here have any place, fora&s;much as at the time of the a&s;&s;umption of it, there was not any who could make any grant thereof, the Emperor of the We&s;t never having any power or autoritie over it; and as little &s;uperioritie or juri&s;diction had any other we&s;tern Prince; and therefore could &s;o much the le&s;s give it to another. The Emperor of the Ea&s;t, not having force &s;ufficient to keep it, had long &s;ince aban|doned it, and beeing thereupon dive&s;ted of all the power hee had over it, and of the po&s;&s;e&s;sion thereof, never made any grant thereof in the &s;ucce&s;sive peace and treaties which happened af|terwards betwixt the &s;aid Empire and the Republick. Notwith|&s;tanding all which, the Italian Lawyers, as profe&s;&s;ors of the Ce|&s;arean Law, and &s;worn to the very words of it, beeing be&s;ides mo&s;t devoted to his Imperial Maje&s;tie, as if at this pre&s;ent day <HI>Augustus</HI> or <HI>Antoninus</HI> did reign, do force them&s;elves with all extor|tion, to verifieupon the We&s;tern Emperor that &s;aying, <HI>Imperator e&s;t Dominus Mundi,</HI> The Emperor is Lord of the world. Which at that very time when it was fir&s;t pronounced, was not true in the hundred part of the world, and at this pre&s;ent not in any con&s;iderable proportion. And while&s;t they would honor the Emperor, and give him, with &s;uch words as the&s;e, that which hee neither hath nor can have, they con&s;ider not the ab&s;urditie of the &s;peech, as if they &s;hould &s;ay, that no King po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed any e&s;tate lawfully, unle&s;s it were granted him by the Emperor, which is as true, as when they affirm that the <HI>Venetians</HI> po&s;&s;e&s;s the Adria|tick Sea, by an Imperial privilege. But it appear's clear enough, in what &s;en&s; this is &s;poken by them, becau&s;e there is none of them do intend thereby, that there was ever any &s;uch Grant made thereof by the Emperor; but by that they do figuratively intend a privilege a&s;&s;umed by immemorable po&s;&s;e&s;sion, which po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion
<PB N="17" REF="14"> they interpret to bee with the knowledg and &s;ufferance of the Emperor, which is as much as if they &s;hould &s;ay, that Chri&s;tian Kings po&s;&s;e&s;s their Kingdoms, and the Republick po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;eth the <HI>Adriatick Sea,</HI> as lawfully by their title of acquiring it, as if tho&s;e Kingdoms and that Sea had belonged to the Emperor, and from and by him to tho&s;e Princes, and to the Republick af|terwards granted. So &s;paciou&s;ly did <HI>Chizzola</HI> dilate in &s;peaking of the opinion of the Lawyers, it beeing the field of his pro|fe&s;sion: hee concluded, that any one might re&s;t &s;atisfied, as well in truth, as in rea&s;on, that by the Autoritie of the &s;aid Do|ctors, there were &s;ure foundations laid to the cau&s;, which hee did defend.</P>
<P>After the te&s;timonie of the Lawyers, hee added that of the <HI>Hi&s;torians,</HI> who do relate, that the Republick, for more then 300 years pa&s;t, did receiv cu&s;tom, of &s;uch as &s;ailed that Sea, and kept armed ve&s;&s;els in a readine&s;s, for to compel all &s;uch &s;hips &s;o &s;ail|ing, to go to <HI>Venice,</HI> te&s;tifying moreover, that even unto their pre&s;ent time the &s;ame cu&s;tom was ob&s;erved. But upon their at|te&s;tations hee dwelled not much, &s;aying, that though they were good te&s;timonies of preceding occurrences; yet when one go|eth about to prove the intere&s;ts of Princes, or of private per&s;ons, hee ought to help him&s;elf by authentick writings, and to u&s;e the Hi&s;torians with great di&s;cretion; &s;om of them beeing moved by love, others with hatred, and others with hope of preferment; which con&s;train's them oftentimes to u&s;e flatterie, or Hyperbo|les, upon which cannot bee laid any &s;ure foundation.</P>
<P>Wherefore hee produced an act of the general Council of Lions, <HI>anno</HI> 1274, where the Abbot of <HI>Nerve&s;a,</HI> beeing delegated by the Pope (upon a preten&s;ion of tho&s;e of <HI>Ancona</HI> to have free navigation upon the Adriatick Sea) &s;entenced, that the demand &s;hould bee rejected, and that the <HI>Venetians</HI> &s;hould not bee mo|&s;ted

<P>Al&s;o hee produced two letters of the Emperor <HI>Frederick,</HI> unto Duke <HI>Giovanni Mocenigo,</HI> the fir&s;t dated in <HI>Gratz</HI> 24 Sept. 1478. the other 2 Apr. 1479. from the &s;ame place, where hee tell's him that hee having taken order that there &s;hould bee brought from <HI>Puglia</HI> and <HI>Abruzzo,</HI> to his ca&s;tles of <HI>Ca&s;tro</HI> and of <HI>Istria,</HI> a certain quantitie of corn, hee reque&s;t's that it may bee permitted him to do it freely, which beeing to him a great plea&s;ure, hee &s;hall ac|knowledg it with many thanks.</P>
<P>This hee &s;econded with a letter of <HI>Beatrice</HI> Queen of <HI>Hunga|rie,</HI> to <HI>Giovanni Mocenigo</HI> Duke of <HI>Venice,</HI> dated the la&s;t of Jan. 1481. whereby de&s;iring for her proper u&s;e to have divers things from the parts of <HI>Italie,</HI> which &s;hee could not bring from thence by Sea, without the permi&s;sion of the Republick, &s;hee de&s;ired that, for curte&s;ie &s;ake and friend&s;hip, it might bee granted her, which &s;hee &s;hould take for a great favor, and corre&s;pond upon the like occa&s;ion.</P>

<P>And another of the &s;ame King to <HI>Augustino Barbarigo</HI> the Duke, dated 18 Oct. 1487. in the which relating, that hee ha|ving need of wood for the reparation of a fortre&s;s &s;tanding in the mouth of <HI>Narenta,</HI> hee praied, that hee might have leav to carry it unto <HI>Segna</HI> by Sea, and that there might bee letters patents made thereof, offering to gratifie him in a greater matter.</P>
<P>Hee added to this a letter of <HI>Anne</HI> Queen of <HI>Hungarie</HI> 30 Aug. 1502. in the which recounting the &s;terilitie of the countrie of <HI>Segna,</HI> &s;hee de&s;ite's leav to bring certain victuals from <HI>Puglia</HI> and <HI>Marca,</HI> and that hee would give to the bearer, who was &s;ent on purpo&s;e, letters of licence for the &s;ame, promi&s;ing to acknow|ledg it as a great favor and courte&s;ie.</P>
<P>La&s;tly hee produced a letter dated 3 Sept. 1504. of <HI>Giovanni de Dura</HI> Captain of <HI>Pi&s;mo,</HI> &s;ervant to the Emperor <HI>Maximilian,</HI> which hee writ unto the Duke <HI>Leonardo Loredano,</HI> importing, that <HI>Giacomo Croato,</HI> a &s;ubject of his Maje&s;ties, parting from <HI>Fiano|na,</HI> entered into the Sea, which is under the Dominion of the Republick, for to go to <HI>Segna,</HI> and was there a&s;&s;ailed by an armed bark of Pirates in contempt of the Signorie or Republick, and &s;upplicate's that &s;om order might bee taken therein.</P>
<P>Upon all which particulars, hee weighed mo&s;t that which
<PB N="21" REF="16"> ought be&s;t to bee con&s;idered, having re&s;pect to the times, per|&s;ons, and qualities of the &s;everal Princes, and for greater con|firmation of their a&s;&s;ent, hee remembred the yearly cerimonie u&s;ed at <HI>Venice;</HI> where the Duke in pre&s;ence of the Amba&s;&s;a|dors of other Princes, particularly of his Maje&s;ties, did u&s;e to e&s;pou&s; the Sea, by the ca&s;ting of a Ring into it, with the&s;e words: <HI>De&s;pon&s;amus te mare in &s;ignum veri, &amp; perpetui Dominii:</HI> Wee do marrie the Sea, in &s;ign of our true and perpetual Domi|nion over it. Which cerimonie as the fore&s;aid writers do affirm, had beginning when Pope <HI>Alexander</HI> the third was in <HI>Venice,</HI> notwith&s;tanding they add withal, that it was in&s;tituted in &s;ign of the Dominion which the Republick had formerly gotten, <HI>jure belli.</HI></P>
<P>To the 400 complaints of the Emperors &s;ubjects, and to the &s;entence of <HI>Lie&s;ina,</HI> hee an&s;wered, giving thanks for the remem|bring of them, as a thing brought in much to his favor, be|cau&s; the complaints do pre&s;uppo&s;e the prohibition, and the &s;en|tences, either condemning or ab&s;olving do prove the juri&s;diction.</P>
<P>And to the &s;alt-barks, hee &s;aid, that they were not &s;uffered to go to <HI>Venice,</HI> as never any are &s;uffered to go, all forreign &s;alt beeing prohibited to enter into that citie; and if it were not ca&s;t into the Sea, it was a courte&s;ie, which ought not to bee imputed to them to their prejudice.</P>
<P>Hee concluded, that hee had delivered the true &s;en&s; of the Capitulations, and proved the immemorable po&s;&s;e&s;sion of the <HI>Adriatick</HI> Sea; that hee could have &s;aid much more, but it &s;eem|ed to him &s;uperfluous, and the&s;e two points were made mo&s;t clear; <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> That this pretence of the <HI>Austrians</HI> was but new; and <HI>Secondly,</HI> That their Petition at this Convention could have no place.</P>
<P>The Imperiali&s;ts after they had conferred together, took a re|&s;olution
<PB N="22" REF="17"> not to per&s;evere in the demand of Ju&s;tice, and the Baron with <HI>Suorz</HI> &s;aid openly, that the <HI>Republick was Patron of the Gulph, and might impo&s;e what customs they thought fitting; and that they thought &s;o in their con&s;ciences:</HI> but there withall they were of an opinion, that for hone&s;tie &s;ake, and for the friend&s;hip which the Republick had with the hou&s; of <HI>Au&s;tria,</HI> it &s;hould bee don with the lea&s;t incommoditie of the &s;ubjects to that hou&s;, as could bee po&s;sible. The other three &s;aid, that it was now no time, either to approve or to di&s;approve the Dominion of the Sea, but rather to finde by way of courte&s;ie &s;om kinde of temperature, where|by the Republick might receiv the rights belonging thereunto from the <HI>Au&s;trian</HI> &s;ubjects &s;ailing tho&s;e Seas, and on the other &s;ide, that &s;uch conditions annexed formerly thereunto, might bee taken away, which were incommodious to the <HI>Au&s;trians,</HI> and no waies profitable to the <HI>Venetians.</HI> Whereupon divers waies to effect it were examined, and a conclu&s;ion taken to refer all to their &s;everal Princes, as it was nece&s;&s;arie to refer all things el&s;; the Commi&s;sion beeing to bee onely perfected by their ratificati|on, and &s;o this Convention ended.</P>
