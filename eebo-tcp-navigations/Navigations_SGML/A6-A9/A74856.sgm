<HEAD>A DISCOURSE, or PARLY, continued betwixt <HI>Partricius</HI> and <HI>Peregrine</HI> (upon their landing in <HI>France</HI>) touching the civill Wars of <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Ireland.</HI></HEAD>

<SPEAKER>Peregrine.</SPEAKER>
<P>_GEntle Sir, you are happily arrived on this &s;hore; we are now upon firme ground, upon the faire <HI>Continent</HI> of <HI>France:</HI> we are not circum&s;crib'd or coopt up within the narrow bounds of a rheumatick <HI>I&s;land;</HI> we have all <HI>Europe</HI> before us. Truely I am not a little glad to have &s;haken hands with that tumbling Element the <HI>Sea;</HI> And for <HI>England,</HI> I never intend to &s;ee her againe, unle&s;&s;e it be in a <HI>Map;</HI> nay, <HI>In &s;tatu quo nunc,</HI> while this <HI>Faction</HI> reignes, had I left one eye be|hind me, I &s;hould hardly returne thither to fetch it; therefore if I be mi&s;&s;ing at any time, never looke for me there. There is an old Proverb, <HI>From a blacke German, a white Italian, a red French|man,</HI> I may adde one member more, and, <HI>from a Round-headed Engli&s;hman, The Lord deliver us.</HI></P>

<SPEAKER>Partricius.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have often cro&s;&s;ed the&s;e Seas, and I found my &s;elfe alwayes pitifully &s;icke; I did ever and anone tell what <HI>Wood</HI> the Ship was made of; but in this pa&s;&s;age I did not feele the lea&s;t motion or di&s;temper in my humors: for, indeed I had no time to thinke on &s;ickne&s;&s;e, I was &s;o wholly taken up, and tran&s;ported with &s;uch a plea&s;ing conceit, to have left yonder mi&s;erable <HI>I&s;land.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pereg.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mi&s;erable <HI>I&s;land</HI> indeed; for I thinke there was ne|ver &s;uch a tyrannie exerci&s;ed in any Chri&s;tian Countrey under
<PB N="2" REF="3"> Heaven; a tyrannie that extends not onely to the <HI>body,</HI> but the <HI>braine</HI> al&s;o; not only to mens fortunes and e&s;tates, but it reaches to their very &s;oules and con&s;ciences, by violented new coercive Oaths and Prote&s;tations, compos'd by Lay-men, incon&s;i&s;tent with the liberty of Chri&s;tians. Never was there a Nation car|ried away by &s;uch a &s;trong &s;pirit of delu&s;ion; never was there a poore people &s;o purblinded and <HI>Puppified,</HI> if I may &s;ay &s;o, as I finde them to be; &s;o that I am at a &s;tand with my &s;elfe, whether I &s;hall <HI>pitie</HI> them more, or <HI>laugh</HI> at them. They not onely ki&s;&s;e the &s;tone that hurts them, but the hands of them that hurle it; they are come to that pa&s;&s;ive &s;tupidity, that they adore their very per&s;ecutors, who from <HI>polling</HI> fall now a &s;having them, and will flay them at la&s;t, if they continue this popular reigne. I cannot compare <HI>England,</HI> as the ca&s;e &s;tands with her, more pro|perly, then to a poore bea&s;t, &s;icke of the &s;taggers, who cannot be cur'd without an inci&s;ion. The A&s;tronomers, I remember, affirme that the <HI>Moone</HI> (which predominates over all humid bodies) hath a more powerfull influence o're your <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Seas then any other; &s;o that according to the ob&s;ervation of &s;ome <HI>Navigators,</HI> they &s;well at a &s;pring tide in &s;ome places, above three&s;core cubits high: I am of opinion, that that incon&s;tant humorous <HI>Planet,</HI> hath al&s;o an extraordinany dominion over the <HI>braines</HI> of the Inhabitants; for when they attempt any Innova|tion (whereunto all <HI>In&s;ulary</HI> people are more &s;ubject then other Citizens of the world which are fixed upon the <HI>Continent</HI>) they &s;well higher, their fancies worke &s;tronglier, and &s;o commit &s;tranger extravagancies then any other: witne&s;&s;e the&s;e mon|&s;trous barbari&s;mes and violences, which have been, and are daily offered to <HI>Religion</HI> and <HI>Iu&s;tice,</HI> (the two grand &s;upporters of all States) yea, to humane <HI>Rea&s;on</HI> it &s;elfe, &s;ince the beginning of the&s;e tumults.</P>
<P>And now, noble Sir, give me leave to render you my humble thanks for that true and &s;olid information you plea&s;ed to give me in <HI>London</HI> of the&s;e commotions.</P>
<PB N="3" REF="3">
<P>During my &s;hort &s;ojourne there, I lighted on divers odde Pamphlets upon the <HI>Seam&s;tre&s;&s;es</HI> &s;talls, whom I wondred to &s;ee &s;elling <HI>Paper</HI> &s;heets in lieu of <HI>Holland:</HI> one the one &s;ide I found the mo&s;t impudent untruths (vouch'd by publike authority) the ba&s;e&s;t &s;currillities, and poore&s;t gingles of wit, that ever I read in my life; on the other &s;ide I met with many pieces that had good &s;tuffe in them, but gave mee not (being a &s;tranger) a full &s;atisfaction, they look'd no further then the beginning of this Parliament, and the particular emergences thereof: But you have, by your methodicall relation, &s;o perfectly in&s;tructed and rectified my under&s;tanding, by bringing mee to the very &s;ource of the&s;e di&s;tempers, and led me all along the &s;ide of the current by &s;o &s;treight a line, that I believe, who&s;oever will ven|ture upon the mo&s;t intricate task of penning the &s;tory of the&s;e <HI>vertiginous</HI> times, will find him&s;elfe not a little beholden to that piece, which, in deed may be term'd a &s;hort <HI>Chronicle</HI> rather then a <HI>Relation.</HI> Wee are come now under another clime, and here we may mingle words, and vent our conceptions more &s;e|curely, it being, as matters &s;tand, in your Countrey, more &s;afe to &s;peake under the <HI>Lilly</HI> then the <HI>Ro&s;e;</HI> wee may here take in, and put out freer ayre; I meane, we may di&s;cour&s;e with more liberty: for, <HI>words are nought els but ayre articulated, and coagula|ted, as it were, into letters and &s;yllables.</HI></P>

<SPEAKER>Patr.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, I de&s;erve not the&s;e high expre&s;&s;ions of your favou|rable cen&s;ure touching that poore piece; but this I will be bold to &s;ay; That who&s;oever doth reade it impartially, will di&s;cover in the Author the <HI>Genius</HI> of an hone&s;t Patriot, and a Gentleman. And now me thinks I looke on you unfortunate <HI>I&s;land,</HI> as if one did looke upon a Ship to&s;s'd up and downe in di&s;tre&s;&s;e of wind and weather, by a furious tempe&s;t, which the more &s;he tugs and wra&s;tles with the foamie waves of the angry Ocean, the more the fury of the &s;torme encrea&s;eth, and puts her in danger of &s;hipwrack; and you mu&s;t needs thinke, Sir, it would move compa&s;&s;ion in any heart, to behold a poore Ship
<PB N="4" REF="4"> in &s;uch a de&s;perate ca&s;e, &s;pecially when all his <HI>kindred, friends</HI> and <HI>fortunes;</HI> yea, his <HI>Religion,</HI> the mo&s;t precious Trea&s;ure of all, are aboard of her, and upon point of &s;incking. Alas I can contribute nothing now to my poore countrey but my prayers and teares, that it would plea&s;e God to allay this tempe&s;t, and ca&s;t over board tho&s;e that are the true cau&s;ers of it, and bring the people to the right u&s;e of <HI>Rea&s;on</HI> againe. It was well ob|&s;erved by you, Sir, That there is a Nationall kinde of indi&s;po|&s;ition, and obliquity of mind that rageth now among&s;t our people, and I feare it will be long ere they returne to their old <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> temper, to that rare loyalty and love which they were u&s;ed to &s;hew to their Soveraigne: for all the Principles of Monarchie are quite lo&s;t among&s;t us, tho&s;e ancient and &s;acred flowers of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Diadem are trampled under foot; nay, matters are come to that horrid confu&s;ion, that not onely the <HI>Prerogative</HI> of the Crowne, but the foundamentall <HI>Priviledge</HI> of the free-borne &s;ubject is utterly overthrowne, by tho&s;e who&s;e Predece&s;&s;ors were u&s;ed to be the main &s;upporters of it. &s;o that our King is nece&s;&s;itated to put him&s;elf in Armes for the pre&s;er|vation not only of his own Regall rights, but of <HI>Magna Charta</HI> it &s;elfe, which was never &s;o invaded and violated in any age, by &s;uch cau&s;le&s;&s;e tyrannicall impri&s;onments, by &s;uch unexampled de&s;tructive taxes; by &s;topping the ordinary proce&s;&s;es in Law, and awing all the Courts of Ju&s;tice, by unheard of forced oaths and A&s;&s;ociations, and a thou&s;and other acts, which neither <HI>pre|&s;ident, Book ca&s;e</HI> or <HI>Statute</HI> can warrant, whereof, if the King had done but the twentieth part, hee had been cryed up to be the greate&s;t Tyrant that ever was.</P>

<P>Sir, I am an <HI>Alien,</HI> and &s;o can &s;peake with more free|dome of your Countrey. The &s;hort time that I did eate my bread there, I felt the pul&s;e of the people with as much judge|ment as I could; and I find, that this very word <HI>Parliament</HI> is become a kind of <HI>Idoll</HI> among&s;t them, they doe, as it were pin their &s;alvation upon't; it is held bla&s;phemie to &s;peake again&s;t
<PB N="5" REF="4"> it. The old <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Maxime was: <HI>The King can doe no wrong;</HI> another Nominative ca&s;e is now &s;tept in; <HI>That the Parliament can do no wrong,</HI> nor the <HI>King receive any:</HI> And whereas there was u&s;ed to be but one Defender of the <HI>Faith,</HI> there are now &s;tarted up among&s;t you, I cannot tell how many hundreds of them. And as in the &s;acred profe&s;&s;ion of <HI>Prie&s;t-hood</HI> wee hold, or at lea&s;twi&s;e &s;hould hold, That after the <HI>Impo&s;ition</HI> of hands, the Mini&s;ter is in&s;pired with the Holy Gho&s;t in an extraordinary manner for the enabling of him to exerci&s;e that Divine Functi|on: &s;o the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> are growne to &s;uch a fond conceit of their <HI>Parliament</HI> members, that as &s;oone as any is cho&s;en by the con|fus'd cry of the Common people to &s;it within the walls of that Hou&s;e, an inerring &s;pirit, a &s;pirit of infallibility pre&s;ently en|tereth into him (&s;o that he is thereby become like the <HI>Pope,</HI> a <HI>Canon animatus</HI>) though &s;ome of them may haply be &s;uch flat and &s;imple animals, that they are as fit to be Coun&s;ellors there, as <HI>Caligula's</HI> Hor&s;e was to be <HI>Con&s;ull,</HI> as the Hi&s;torian tells us.</P>

<SPEAKER>Patr.</SPEAKER>
<P>Touching <HI>Parliament,</HI> there breaths not a Subject un|der <HI>Englands</HI> Crowne, who hath a higher e&s;teeme of it then I, it makes that dainty mixture in our government of <HI>Monarchie, Optimacie</HI> and <HI>Democracy,</HI> betwixt whom, though there be a kind of <HI>co-ordination</HI> of power during the &s;itting of <HI>Parliament,</HI> yet the two la&s;t, which are compo&s;ed of Peers and People, have no power, but what is derived from the fir&s;t, which may be called the &s;oul that animates them, and by who&s;e authority they meet, con&s;ult and depart: They come there to <HI>propo&s;e,</HI> not to <HI>impo&s;e</HI> Lawes; they come not to make Lawes by the &s;word; they mu&s;t not be like <HI>Draco's</HI> Lawes, written in blood. Their <HI>King</HI> calls them thither to be his Coun&s;ellors, not Controllers; and the Office of Coun&s;ell is to advi&s;e, not to inforce; they come thi|ther to <HI>intreat,</HI> not to <HI>treat</HI> with their Liege Lord; they come to throw their <HI>Petitions</HI> at his feet, that &s;o they may find a way to his heart.</P>
<P>'Tis true, I have read of high things that our <HI>Parliaments</HI> have
<PB N="6" REF="5"> done, but 'twas either during the nonage and minority of our Kings, when they were under protector&s;hip, or when they were ab&s;ent in a forraigne war, or in time of confu&s;ion, when there were competitors of the blood-royall for the Crowne, and when the number of both Hou&s;es was compleat and individed; but I never reade of any <HI>Parliament</HI> that did arrogate to it &s;elfe &s;uch a power <HI>Paramount,</HI> &s;uch a <HI>Superlative &s;uperintendence,</HI> as to checke the Prerogative of their Soveraigne, to que&s;tion his <HI>ne|gative</HI> voyce, to pa&s;&s;e things, not onely without, but expre&s;ly again&s;t his advice and royall command: I never heard of <HI>Par|liament,</HI> that would have their King, being come to the <HI>meri|dian</HI> of his age, to tran&s;mit his intellectualls, and whole fa|culty of rea&s;on to them. I finde &s;ome <HI>Parliaments</HI> have been &s;o mode&s;t and moderate <HI>(And moderation is the Rudder that &s;hould &s;teere the cour&s;e of all great Councells)</HI> that they have de|clined the agitation and cognizance of &s;ome &s;tate affaires, hum|bly transferring them to their Soveraigne and his privie Coun|&s;ell: a <HI>Parliament man</HI> then, held it to be the <HI>adaequate</HI> object of his duty, to &s;tudy the welfare, to redre&s;&s;e the grievances, and &s;upply the defects of that place for which he &s;erved; the <HI>Bur|geois</HI> of <HI>Linne</HI> &s;tudied to find out &s;omething that might advance the trade of <HI>Fi&s;hing;</HI> he of <HI>Norwich,</HI> what might advantage the making of <HI>Stuffe;</HI> he of <HI>Rye,</HI> what might pre&s;erve their <HI>Harbour</HI> from being choaked up with <HI>Sand;</HI> he of <HI>Tave&s;ton,</HI> what might further the <HI>Manufacture</HI> of <HI>Ker&s;eyes,</HI> and they thought to have complyed with the <HI>Obligation,</HI> and di&s;charged the con&s;ciences of hone&s;t Patriots, without &s;oaring above their reach, and ro|ving at randome to treat of univer&s;als, to bring Religion to their barre, to prie into the <HI>Arcana Imperii,</HI> the cognizance of the one belonging to the King, and his interne Coun&s;ell of State: the other to <HI>Divines,</HI> who, according to the <HI>Etymologie</HI> of the <HI>word,</HI> u&s;e to be &s;till conver&s;ant in the exerci&s;e and &s;peculation of holy and heavenly things.</P>

<SPEAKER>Pereg.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am clearely of your opinion in the&s;e two particu|lars;
<PB N="7" REF="5"> for, <HI>&s;ecrecie being the &s;oule of policie,</HI> matters of State &s;hould be communicated but to few; and touching Religion, I can|not &s;ee how it may <HI>quadrat</HI> with the calling, and be <HI>homogene|ous</HI> to the profe&s;&s;ion of Laymen, to determine matters of Divi|nity, who, out of their incapacity and unaptne&s;&s;e to the worke, being not <HI>pares negotio;</HI> and being carried away by a wilde kind of <HI>Con&s;cience</HI> without <HI>Science,</HI> like a Ship without a Helme, fall upon dangerous quick-&s;ands; &s;o that while&s;t they labour to mend her, they mar her, whil&s;t they thinke to &s;ettle her, they confound her, while&s;t they plot to prevent the growth of <HI>Poperie,</HI> they pauce the way to bring it in, by conniving at, and countenancing tho&s;e mon&s;trous Schi&s;mes, I ob&s;erved to have crept into your Chruch &s;ince the <HI>reigne</HI> of this <HI>Parliament:</HI> &s;o that one may ju&s;tly &s;ay, The&s;e your <HI>Reformers</HI> are but the exe|cutioners of the old project of the Je&s;uits, the main part where|of was, and is &s;till, to hurle the ball of di&s;cord, and hatch new opinions &s;till 'twixt the <HI>Prote&s;tants,</HI> to make fractions and &s;ci&s;&s;ures betweene them, and &s;o render their Religion more de&s;picable and ridiculous.</P>
<P>But me thinks, matters are come to a &s;trange pa&s;&s;e with you in <HI>England,</HI> that the <HI>Iudges</HI> cannot be tru&s;ted with the <HI>Law,</HI> nor the <HI>Prelats</HI> with the <HI>Go&s;pell;</HI> whereas from all times, out of their long experience and yeeres, the&s;e two degrees were of men u&s;ed to be reverenced for the chiefe <HI>Ttruch-men,</HI> and unque&s;tionable <HI>Expo&s;itors</HI> of both, which another power &s;eemes now to arro|gate to it &s;elfe, as the inerring <HI>Oracle</HI> of both: but I pray God that the&s;e grand <HI>Refiners</HI> of Religion, prove not <HI>Quack&s;alvers</HI> at la&s;t; that the&s;e up&s;tart <HI>Polititians</HI> prove not <HI>Impo&s;tors:</HI> for I have heard of &s;ome things they have done, that if <HI>Machiavell</HI> him&s;elfe were alive, he would be reputed a Saint in compari&s;on of them. The <HI>Roman</HI> ten, and <HI>Athenian</HI> thirty, were Babies to the&s;e; nay, the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Inqui&s;ition, and the <HI>Bloet-Rade</HI> (that Councell of blood) which the Duke of <HI>Alva</HI> erected in <HI>Flan|ders,</HI> when he &s;wore, <HI>That hee would drowne the Hollanders in
<PB N="8" REF="6"> their Butter-tubs,</HI> was nothing to this; when I con&s;ider the pro|digious power they have a&s;&s;umed to them&s;elves, and doe daily exerci&s;e over the bodies, the e&s;tates and &s;oules of men.</P>
<P>In your former Di&s;cour&s;e you told me, that among&s;t multi|tudes of other mi&s;chiefs, which this new Faction hath wrought, they have put <HI>divi&s;ion</HI> twixt all &s;orts and &s;exes, twixt all con|ditions, both of men and women; one thing more I may &s;ay they have done in this kind: for, they have laboured to put <HI>divi&s;ion</HI> between the <HI>Per&s;ons</HI> of the holy <HI>Trinity,</HI> by making the fir&s;t <HI>Per&s;on</HI> to be offended at that voluntary <HI>genuflexion</HI> and reve|rence which hath been from all times practi&s;ed in the Chri&s;ti|an Church to the name of the &s;econd <HI>Per&s;on;</HI> &s;o that <HI>Ie&s;u-war|&s;hip,</HI> as I have read in &s;ome of your profane Pamphlets, is growne now to be a word of reproach among&s;t you.</P>
<P>But to the point; there is one thing I can never cea&s;e to wonder at: that whereras at the beginning of this <HI>Parliament,</HI> there were as able and experienced, as &s;tout and well &s;poken Gentlemen, as any in the whole Kingdome, that &s;ate in the Hou&s;e, and made the far major part, I wonder I &s;ay, that they would &s;uffer this giddy-headed Faction to carry all before them in that violent manner, that they did not cru&s;h this <HI>Cocatrice</HI> in the &s;hell.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Patr.</SPEAKER>
<P>Fir&s;t, Sir, you know there is nothing &s;o agreeable to the nature of man, as <HI>noveltie;</HI> and in the conduct of humane affaires, it is alwayes &s;eene, that when any new de&s;igne or facti|on is afoot, the Projectors are commonly more pragmaticall and &s;edulous upon the worke; they lie centinell to watch all advantages, the Sand of their braines is alwayes running this hath cau&s;ed, this up&s;tart Faction, to &s;ticke &s;till clo&s;e toge|ther, and continue marvellou&s;ly con&s;tant to their ends; they have been u&s;ed to tyre and out-fa&s;t, to weary and out-watch the moderate and well-minded Gentlemen; &s;ometimes till after midnight, by clancular and nocturnall &s;ittings; &s;o that as his Maje&s;tie &s;ayes in one of his Declarations, mo&s;t of their Votes
<PB N="9" REF="6"> may be &s;aid to be nought el&s;e, but <HI>Verdicts of a &s;tarv'd Iury.</HI></P>
<P>Another rea&s;on is, That they countenanced the flocking to|gether of the promi&s;cuous rabble from <HI>London,</HI> notwith&s;tan|ding the two &s;everall motions the Lords made unto them, that they might be &s;uppre&s;&s;ed by Parliamentary Order: This rio|ous crue awed the wonted freedome of &s;peech in both Hou&s;es, cryed up the names, and confronted many of their Members: yet the&s;e new Polititians not onely conniv'd at them, but call'd them their <HI>friends;</HI> and &s;o they might well enough, or rather their <HI>Champions;</HI> for they had ordered the matter &s;o, that they were &s;ure to have them ready at their devotion, at the heaving of a finger: and from this tumultuous <HI>mongrell crue,</HI> they de|rived their fir&s;t encouragements to doe &s;uch high prodigious in&s;olencies they have committed &s;ince.

<Q>Upon a time, the Starres complained to <HI>Apollo,</HI> that hee di&s;played his beames too much upon &s;ome malignant Planets; That the <HI>Moone</HI> had too great a &s;hare of his influence, and that he was carryed away too much by her motion: They complained al&s;o, that the con&s;tellation of <HI>Libra</HI> (which holds the ballance of Iu&s;tice) had but a dim light, and that the <HI>A&s;trean</HI> Court was growne altogether de&s;tructive with divers other grievances. <HI>Apollo</HI> hereupon, commanded <HI>Mercury</HI> to &s;ummon a generall Synod, where &s;ome out of every A&s;teri&s;me throughout the whole Firmament were to meet; <HI>Apollo</HI> told them, I am placed here by the finger of the Almigh|ty, to be Monarch of the Skie, to be the mea&s;urer of Time, and I goe upon his errand round about the world every foure and twenty houres: I am al&s;o the Fountaine of heat and light, which, though I u&s;e to di&s;pence and difo+fu&s;e in equall proportions throughout the whole univer&s;e; yet I make dif|ference twixt objects, a Ca&s;tle hath more of my light then a Cottage, and the Cedar hath more of me then the Shrub: But touching the <HI>Moone,</HI> (the &s;econd great Luminary) I would have you know, that &s;he is deare&s;t unto me, therefore let none repine that I cheri&s;h her with my beames, and confer more light on her, then upon any other. Touching the malignant Planets, or any other Star, of what magnitude &s;oever, that moves not in a regular motion, or hath runne any excentrique exorbitant cour&s;e, or that would have made me to move out of the <HI>Zodiak,</HI> I put them over unto you, that upon due examination, and proofe, they may be <HI>un&s;phear'd,</HI> or extingui&s;hed. But I would have this done with moderation; I would have you to k epe as neere as you can between the <HI>Tropiques</HI> and tempe|rate <HI>Zones:</HI> I would have things reduced to their true principles, <HI>refor|med, not ruin'd;</HI> I would not have the whole government of the Skie overturned for redre&s;&s;e of a few petty abu&s;es; I would have the &s;pirit of malice and lying, the &s;pirit of partiality and inju&s;tice, the &s;pirit of tyran|ny and rigor, the ba&s;e &s;pirit of feare and jealou&s;ie to be far from this glo|rious Synod; I would have all private intere&s;ts reflecting upon revenge or profit, to be utterly bani&s;hed hence: moreover, I would not have you
<PB N="11" REF="7"> to make grievances, where no grievances are, or dangers, where no dan|gers are, I would have no creation of dangers; I would have you to hu&s;|band time as par&s;imoniou&s;ly as you can, le&s;t by keeping too long together, and amu&s;ing the world with &s;uch tedious hopes of redre&s;&s;e of grievances, you prove your &s;elves the greate&s;t grievance at la&s;t, and &s;o from <HI>Starres,</HI> become <HI>Comets:</HI> La&s;tly, I would have you to be very cautious how you tamper with my Soveraigne power, and chop Logick with mee in that point; you know what became of <HI>Him,</HI> who once pre&s;umed to meddle with my Chariot: Hereupon the whole ho&s;t of Heaven being <HI>con&s;tellated</HI> thus into one great Body, fell to a &s;erious deliberation of things; and <HI>Apollo</HI> him&s;elfe continued his pre&s;ence, and &s;ate among&s;t them in his full lu&s;tre, but in the meane time, while&s;t they were in the midde&s;t of their con&s;ulta|tions, the le&s;&s;er &s;ort of the mongrell Starres which make up the <HI>Galaxia</HI> (the milkie way in Heaven) gather in a tumultuous di&s;orderly manner about the body of <HI>Apollo,</HI> and commit many &s;trange in&s;olencies, which cau&s;ed <HI>Apollo</HI> (taking young <HI>Pho&s;phorus</HI> with him) to retyre him&s;elfe, and to withdraw his light from the Synod: &s;o all began to be involv'd in a &s;trange kinde of confu&s;ion and ob&s;curity; they groaped in the darke, not knowing which way to move, or what cour&s;e to take, all things went <HI>Can|cerlike,</HI> retrograde, becau&s;e the <HI>Sunne</HI> detained his beames from them?</Q>
<P>Such as the <HI>Sun</HI> is in the Firmament, a <HI>Monarch</HI> is in his Kingdome: for, <HI>as the Wi&s;e&s;t of men</HI> &s;aith, <HI>In the light of the Kings countenance there is life,</HI> and I believe that to be the <HI>morall</HI> of this A&s;trean <HI>Fable.</HI></P>

<P>Sir, I remember to have read in the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Story, That when the Earle of <HI>Kildare,</HI> in <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth's time, was brought before the Lord <HI>Deputy</HI> for burning <HI>Ca&s;siles</HI> Church, he an&s;wered, <HI>My Lord, I would never have burnt the Church, un|le&s;&s;e I had thought the Bi&s;hop had been in it;</HI> for 'twas not the Church, but the Bi&s;hop I aim'd at. One may &s;ay &s;o of the <HI>Anglican</HI> Church at this pre&s;ent, that the&s;e fierie <HI>Zelots,</HI> the&s;e

I grant there was never yet any Profe&s;&s;ion made up of men, but there were &s;ome bad; we are not Angels upon earth; there was a <HI>Iudas</HI> among&s;t the fir&s;t dozen of <HI>Chri&s;tians,</HI> though Apo&s;tles, and they by our <HI>Saviour's</HI> owne election: Among&s;t our Pre|lates, peradventure (for I know of no accu&s;ation fram'd again&s;t them yet) &s;ome might be faultie, and wanting moderation, be|ing not contented to walk upon the battlements of the Church, but they mu&s;t put them&s;elves upon &s;tilts; but if a golden chaine hath happily a copper linke, two or three, will you therefore breake and throw away the whole chaine.

<Q><P>Upon a time the <HI>Birds</HI> met in Councell, for redre&s;&s;e of &s;ome extrava|vagancies that had <HI>flowne</HI> into the <HI>volatill</HI> Empire; Nor was it the fir&s;t time that <HI>Birds</HI> met thus; for the <HI>Phrygian Fabler</HI> tells us of divers meetings of theirs: And after him we reade that <HI>Apolonius Thyanent,</HI> undertook the interpretation of their language, and to be their <HI>Dragoman.</HI></P>
<P>They thus a&s;&s;embled in one great <HI>Covie</HI> by the call of the <HI>Eagle</HI> their unque&s;tioned hereditary King, and by vertue of his royall authority. Com|plaints were brought, that divers <HI>Cormorants</HI> and <HI>Harpies,</HI> with other <HI>Birds</HI> of prey, had got in among&s;t them, who did much annoy and invade the publique liberty: &s;undrie other <HI>Birds</HI> were que&s;tioned, which cau&s;ed <HI>&s;ome</HI> to take a timely flight into another ayre.</P>
<P>As they were thus con&s;ulting for advancement of the common good,
<PB N="15" REF="10"> many <HI>Rookes, Horne-Owles</HI> and <HI>Sea-guls</HI> flock'd together,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Citizens, Sea-men.</NOTE> and fluttered about the place they were a&s;&s;embled in, where they kept a hideous noy&s;e, and committed many outrages, and nothing could &s;atisfie them, but the <HI>Griffons</HI> head,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ear. <HI>Straff.</HI> Cre&s;t.</NOTE> which was therefore chopt off and offered up as a &s;acrifice to make them leave their <HI>chattering,</HI> and appea&s;e their fury for the time.</P>
<P>They fell foule afterwards upon the <HI>Pies,</HI> who were u&s;ed to be much reverenced, and to &s;it upon the highe&s;t <HI>pearch</HI> in that great A&s;&s;embly: they called them Idolatrous and inau&s;picious <HI>Birds,</HI> they hated their mixt colour, repined at their long traine, they tore their white feathers, and were ready to peck out their eyes: they did what they could to put them in <HI>Owles</HI> feathers, to make them the more hated, and to be &s;tar'd and hooted at where&s;oever they pa&s;&s;ed. The <HI>Pies</HI> being thus &s;car'd, pre&s;ented a Petition to the royall <HI>Eagle,</HI> and to this his great Coun&s;ell, that they might be &s;ecured to repaire &s;afely thither to &s;it and con&s;ult, according to the ancient Lawes of the <HI>Volatill</HI> Empire continued &s;o many ages without controllment or que&s;tion: in which Petition they in&s;erted a <HI>Prote&s;t</HI> or <HI>Caveat,</HI> that no publike Act pa&s;&s;e &s;hould in the interim. This Supplication, both for matter and forme, was excepted again&s;t, and cryed up to be high Trea&s;on, &s;pecially that indefinite <HI>Prote&s;t</HI> they had made, that no Act what|&s;oever &s;hould be of any validity without them, which was alledged to dero|gate frrom the High Law-making power of that great Coun&s;ell, and ten|ded to retard and di&s;turb the great affaires which were then in agitation: &s;o the poore <HI>Pies,</HI> as if by that Petition they had like the <HI>Black-bird</HI> voy|ded Lime to catch them&s;elves, for <HI>Turdus cacat &s;ibi malum,</HI> were &s;ud|denly hurried away into a Cage, and after ten long Moneths canva&s;&s;ing of the point, they were <HI>unpearch'd,</HI> and rendred for ever uncapable to be mem|bers of that Court, they were &s;trucke dumb and voyce-le&s;&s;e, and &s;uddenly blowne up away thence without any force of <HI>powder,</HI> as once was plotted again&s;t them. But this was done when a thin number of <HI>Birds</HI> had kept &s;till together, and &s;tuck clo&s;e again&s;t them, and after that the Bill con|cerning them had been once ejected, which they humbly conceived by the ancient order of that Court could not be re-admitted in the &s;ame Se&s;&s;ion. They Petitioned from the place they were cooped in, that for heavens &s;ake, for the honour of that noble Coun&s;ell, for truth and ju&s;tice &s;ake, they be|ing as free-borne Deni&s;ons of the ayre Region, as any other <HI>Volatils</HI> what|&s;oever, their charge might be perfected, that &s;o they might be brought to a legall triall, and not forced to langui&s;h in &s;uch captivity. They pleaded to have done nothing but what they had precedents for: And touching the <HI>Caveat</HI> they had in&s;erted, it was a thing u&s;uall in every inferiour Court

<P>There wants not &s;ome, who affirme, that in this great Coun&s;ell of <HI>Birds.</HI> there were &s;ome <HI>Decoyes,</HI> (and 'tis well knowne <HI>where Decoyes</HI> were fir&s;t bred) who called in,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Holland.</NOTE> not only the&s;e mongrell ob&s;treperous <HI>Birds</HI> from abroad to commit &s;uch outrages as were &s;poken of before, but drew after them al|&s;o many of the greate&s;t <HI>Birds,</HI> who &s;ate in that A&s;&s;embly, to follow them whither they li&s;ted: Others, who were of a more <HI>generous</HI> extraction, di&s;dained to be &s;uch <HI>Buzzards,</HI> as to be carried away hood-wincked in that manner, to be <HI>Birds</HI> of their feather.

<P>Sir, by this <HI>Ornilogicall Apologue,</HI> you have not onely confirmed, but al&s;o enriched, and much enlarged my under|&s;tanding in the knowledge of things. Good Lord, how pitifully were tho&s;e pore Prelates handled; what a <HI>Tartarian</HI> kind of

<Q><P>Upon a time, The <HI>Flowers</HI> a&s;&s;embled, and met in one generall Coun&s;ell, by the authority and &s;ummons of the Soveraigne <HI>Ro&s;e,</HI> their undoubted naturall King, who had taken the <HI>Lilly</HI> for his royall &s;pou&s;e.

Amongst many other good-morrowes, they propounded to the <HI>Ro&s;e,</HI> that he &s;hould part with his <HI>prickles,</HI> and tran&s;mit his &s;trength that way to be di&s;po&s;ed of by them; the <HI>Ro&s;e</HI> liked not this bold reque&s;t of theirs, though couched in very &s;mooth language, but an&s;wered, I have hitherto conde&s;ended to every thing you have propounded, much more then any of
