<HEAD>A Me&s;&s;age &s;ent from his Highne&s;s the Lord Protector to the Turks, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>HIs Highne&s;s the Lord Protector having taken into &s;erious con&s;i|deration, the mo&s;t deplorable &amp; &s;uffering condition of the poor captiva|ted Engli&s;h at Argier, and other places in Turky, graciou&s;ly vouch&s;afed to &s;end an Expre&s;s to the Governour of Argier, re|quiring a Re&s;tauration of the Engli&s;h Captives; and withal, adjuring him to de|&s;i&s;t from any &s;uch future violence, again&s;t the Engli&s;h Subjects: This Me&s;&s;age was
<PB N="4" REF="3">re&s;ented with &s;o much terrour and a&s;to|ni&s;hment, that the Governour immediat|ly gave Order, for the relea&s;e of all the Engli&s;h; and &s;et forth an Edict, or Pro|clamation, prohibiting the &s;eizing of any Engli&s;h Ve&s;&s;el what&s;oever, upon pain of death; and to incur the &s;eizure of their whole E&s;tate, in ca&s;e of any ob&s;tructing, or interpo&s;ing any Engli&s;h man what&s;o|ever, in their free Trade and Commerce; &amp;c.</P>
<P>By an Expre&s;s from General Blakes Fleet, thus. Sir, When we came into Cales Road, we &s;aluted the Town with 21 pieces of Ordnance, they re|turned us 7 for one, both Engli&s;h, Spaniards, and Hollanders. The Dutch Admiral vailed his Flag and &s;aluted. Our General a&s;&s;ured the Spaniards we intended nothing prejudicial to them, who before &s;u&s;pected us. We &s;ailed from thence to the Straights, anchoring in Gibralter Road; where we went on &s;hore, and were very courteou&s;ly re|ceived by the Governour, who promi&s;ed us ac|commodation in what&s;oever we wanted, and the
<PB N="5" REF="3">Countrey afforded: VVe were very courteou&s;|ly &s;aluted by the Clergy, and had four Officers of their Army went bare before us, conducting us through the Town, and to the Cu&s;tome-Hou&s;e, at the reque&s;t of the Goxernour, who had there provided a very &s;tately Collation for us. He al&s;o made proclamation (having received Order from the King &s;o to do) That none what&s;oever &s;hould affront the Engli&s;h upon pain of pre&s;ent Death. VVe had not been long here, but one of our Vic|tualling &s;hips (the Dolphin) who by the late &s;torms was &s;eperated from us, came to us: In her way &s;he fell among 7 great French &s;hips, who took her; the Admiral then called our Captain on board his &s;hip (which carried 56 pieces of Bra&s;s Ordnance) demanding of him where Gen. Blake was, and what &s;trength he had with him? He re|plyed, That he was gone to the Steights with 30 Men of VVar. The Admiral therewith was trou|bled; and proffered him a great &s;um of money to &s;atisfie for what his men had taken from him, and de&s;ired him to &s;tay, and he would enquire after tho&s;e that had plundered him, and execute them: but our Capt. refu&s;ed both VVhereupon drink|ing General Blakes Health, they di&s;charged him, and he came to us with all &s;peed.</P>

<HEAD>A Letter frrom the Navy.</HEAD>
<P>UPon our advance from Cadiz, further into the Levant &s;ea, VVee met with many diffi|culties, not onely by &s;tomy and un&s;ea&s;onable Weather, but by &s;ome ob&s;cure Rocks, which our Pylots were not very wel acquainted with: But ha|ving for &s;ome time waited upon the Series of Di|vine Providence, we then immediatly found the Omnipotent workings of the mo&s;t high Protect|or, and great Jehovah of Heaven for Us; who, e|ven in an in&s;tant, when we were all toyling and plunging through the Deep, cau&s;ed the winds to cea&s;e, and the Seas to become calm; &s;o that our whole Fleet (ble&s;&s;ed be God) in few houres came within &s;ight of each other, who bearing up to the Ambral, our General commanded forth Captain Sacheverel with the Pearl Frigat, and Cap. George Crapnel in the Merlin Galley, as Scouts; who af|ter 5 hours &s;ayl di&s;covered a Fleet with French co|lours, con&s;i&s;ting of 17 in number, which Cap Sa|cheverel haled; but the French refu&s;ed to an&s;wer: whereupon, he bare up to them, being accompa|nied by valiant Ca. Crapnel, and having the wind|ward, gave them &s;even broad &s;ides; which thunde|ring Eccho arriving the Eares of our heroick Ge|neral, he pre&s;ently bare up with the George, &amp; the
<PB N="7" REF="4">re&s;t of the Fleet to the very head of them, &amp; charg|ed them through and through five times together; in&s;omuch, that the French tack'd about, and decli|ned Engagement; but we embraced the pur&s;uit, &amp; in the cha&s;e &s;unk 3, fir'd two, and took 5, which we de&s;erted, they being &s;o leakie, that &s;uddenly they &s;unk al&s;o. The re&s;t fled towards Naples, where the D. of Gui&s;e is with his Fleet; whom we are under &s;ayl to vi&s;it. But by a &s;tratagem ('tis &s;aid) his Highne&s;s, with the Lord St. Paul, and divers o|ther chief Commanders, are &s;urprized in the City, upon a pretence of &s;urrender; in the mean time, confident I am, (by divine permi&s;&s;ion) that we &s;hal &s;uddenly ingage them; for our men are re&s;olved to fight them, though they be five to one. Our Ge|neral hath &s;et up the Engli&s;h Standard, bearing St. Georges Cro&s;s, at the Head of all the Flag &s;hips; which carries no little terror to the Pyrats in the&s;e parts; who abounded very much upon the Le|vant; but are now pretty well di&s;pierced; for we have put a period to above 100 of them within the &s;pace of a month; and have taken 11 Turki&s;h Gal|leys, in which Atchievment, Capain Hill with the VVorce&s;ter Frigat, and Capt. Cattens in the Lam|port performed &s;ingular &s;ervice; but the Pearl lo&s;t her Ma&s;t, and &s;ome other &s;hips their Bolt|&s;prit, and Tackling.</P>
<PB N="8" REF="5">
<P>As touching the influence the Lord Pro|tector hath gained by his Me&s;&s;age to the Turks, 'tis a thing wonderfully to be ad|mired; and indeed, it cau&s;eth no little ad|miration throughout all Chri&s;tendome; for, true it is, the Argier men of War are become A&s;&s;ociates with the Engli&s;h, and will not permit a man of our Nation to be carryed captive into thraldome; but &s;eiz and takes all their Sally &s;hips, and o|thers, that have any Engli&s;h them, and brings them in to Gen. Blake, who at this very in&s;tant, rides tryumphat in the Le|vant Ocean.</P>
