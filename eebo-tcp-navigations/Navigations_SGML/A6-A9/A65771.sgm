<HEAD>A True ACCOUNT OF THE Pa&s;&s;ages at MERGEN IN THE KINGDOM of <HI>SYAM,</HI> After Captain <HI>Anthony Weltden</HI> arrived at that <HI>Port</HI> in the <HI>Curtana Frigat,</HI> for Account of the EAST-INDIA Company.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub"><HI>Humbly Pre&s;ented</HI> To the Honourable the Knights, Citizens and Burge&s;&s;es in Parliament A&s;&s;embled: By <HI>Samuel White.</HI></HEAD>
<P>IN the State of my Ca&s;e, repre&s;enting the in&s;upportable Grievances I at pre&s;ent labour under by the <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> Companies unju&s;t and arbitra|ry Practices I had occa&s;ion to intimate that <HI>His Maje&s;ty</HI> of <HI>Syam,</HI> up|on notice that the &s;aid Companies Servants had committed Ho&s;tili|ties again&s;t him by &s;eizing his Ships, was re&s;olved to appeal to our <HI>Sovereign Lord</HI> the <HI>King,</HI> and make <HI>His Maje&s;ty</HI> the &s;ole Arbitrator of all Matters depending 'twixt him and the &s;aid Company. For which Expedi|tion he was pleas'd to command my Service, and order'd me to prepare a Ship of my own for the Voyage, as I accordingly did, and only waited for my di&s;patches from <HI>Court;</HI> When on the 26th of <HI>June,</HI> 87. Captain <HI>Weltden</HI> in the <HI>Curtana,</HI> and &s;oon after Captain <HI>Go&s;tlin</HI> in the <HI>Sloop James</HI> came into the <HI>Port</HI> of <HI>Mergen</HI> under <HI>His Maje&s;ties</HI> Colours, and when I had very re|&s;pectfully receiv'd Captain <HI>Weltden</HI> at his Landing, he requir'd me in the Name of <HI>Our Sovereign Lord the King</HI> to &s;ummon all the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> on the Place, that he might Publi&s;h <HI>His Maje&s;ties</HI> Commands to them, as was ac|cordingly done, and after he had read the <HI>Proclamation,</HI> together with a Paper from the <HI>Pre&s;ident</HI> and <HI>Council,</HI> he demanded whether they were rea|dy to give due Obedience to their <HI>Sovereign</HI>'s Orders in leaving the <HI>King</HI> of <HI>Syam</HI>'s Service, and return with him to <HI>Fort</HI> St. <HI>George,</HI> whereto 'twas una|nimou&s;ly an&s;wer'd, <HI>Yes,</HI> and <HI>God Save the King,</HI> after which &s;atisfactory re|ply,
<PB N="2" REF="2">he told them he came not to injure any of them, but to protect their Pler&s;ons and E&s;tates, and that they might pay them&s;elves any Arrears of Wa|ges by Plunder on the <HI>King of Syam,</HI> or his Subjects Goods. At the hearing whereof, I thought it next to my Allegiance to my <HI>Native Sovereign,</HI> a mo&s;t incumbent Duty on me to that <HI>Prince</HI> I had the Honour to &s;erve in &s;o con|&s;iderable a Charge, to tell them, It much rejoyced me to find they all agreed in a Loyal Obedience to the Command of the <HI>King Our Lord;</HI> and to put them into better Circum&s;tances for a pre&s;ent Compliance, without any &s;uch acts of Violence as was intimated by the Captain, I was ready to pay eve|ry Man what Wages was due to that very day, as I accordingly did, and declar'd them at that time di&s;charg'd from the <HI>King of Syam</HI>'s Service.</P>
<P>After this, the Captain had a Conference with tho&s;e <HI>Magi&s;trates</HI> on the Place, that were <HI>Native Syamers,</HI> to whom he delivered a Letter from the <HI>Pre&s;ident</HI> and <HI>Council,</HI> injoyning them to forward one that accompanied it to the <HI>King</HI> of <HI>Syam;</HI> the Import whereof was to demand &s;atisfaction for Inju|ries alledged to be done to the Company and their Dependents, to amount of about 65000 <HI>l.</HI> and to acquaint him that they had &s;ent this Ship to block up that <HI>Port,</HI> with order to await &s;ixty days for an An&s;wer, and in failure of compliance in that time, to proceed to make them&s;elves Reparation by force of their Arms.</P>
<P>As to my &s;elf, the Captain was pleas'd to tell me he had order to expect thirty days for my An&s;wer; but I was better re&s;olv'd than to need any time to con&s;ider whether I would obey <HI>His Maje&s;ties</HI> Command, and accordingly I did without delay declare my mind to him in Writing: But as to the Mandate from the <HI>Pre&s;ident</HI> and <HI>Council,</HI> wherein they did by their own Au|thority impo&s;e on me to take up Arms again&s;t the <HI>King of Syam,</HI> I could not but prote&s;t again&s;t it, nor can I now mention it without avowing a ju&s;t Ab|horrence of &s;o nefarious an Act as it would have been in me, to draw a Sword again&s;t my Royal and bountiful <HI>Ma&s;ter,</HI> to who&s;e <HI>Princely</HI> Benignity I &s;tand &s;o highly oblig'd, that all the Services of my Life can never di&s;|charge me, and therefore I hope I &s;hould rather embrace the mo&s;t cruel Death, than be induc'd to any thing may ju&s;tly render me ungrateful.</P>
<P>ALL things did to this time look as well as was po&s;&s;ible under &s;o &s;trange a Conjuncture, there pa&s;&s;ing daily intercour&s;es of Friend&s;hip betwixt the Captain and Us of the Shore, and he declaring him&s;elf very well pleas'd with his kind Reception by the <HI>Syam Magi&s;trates,</HI> and the care was ta|ken to tran&s;late and forward his di&s;patches to <HI>Court;</HI> &s;o that there was not any cau&s;e to doubt but this Tranquillity would at lea&s;t continue till the &s;ixty days limited for the <HI>King</HI> of <HI>Syam</HI>'s An&s;wer were expired. Where|fore on the fifth of <HI>July</HI> I went to <HI>Tena&s;&s;ary,</HI> a Town about fifty Miles di&s;tant, to tran&s;act &s;ome Affairs of the <HI>King</HI> of <HI>Syam</HI>'s that were under my care, but I had not been there two days before I was alarm'd by Letters from <HI>Mergen,</HI> acquainting me that the face of Affairs had on a &s;udden, put on a very ill A&s;pect, for that the Captain had actually made an A&s;&s;ault on the <HI>Port,</HI> in breaking up the Piles that were plac'd for its defence, and &s;eiz'd two Boats the <HI>Magi&s;trates</HI> employ'd to await for the Ships expected from abroad, and al&s;o remov'd my fore&s;aid Ship that was fitted for the <HI>King</HI> of <HI>Syam</HI>'s Service to <HI>England,</HI> carrying her from her moorings under command of his own Fri|gat. Which &s;urprizing Ho&s;tilities had &s;o incens'd the People, that no <HI>Eng|li&s;hman</HI>'s Life could be &s;uppos'd &s;ecure among&s;t them; wherefore it concern'd me, as I regarded my own &s;afety, to di&s;peed my return, as I according|ly did, and arriv'd at <HI>Mergen</HI> the &s;ixth day after my departure, being the
<PB N="3" REF="2">11th of <HI>July.</HI> Nor was I &s;ooner there than divers of our Nation came to give me a more particular Account of the&s;e unhappy Pa&s;&s;ages in my ab&s;ence, and were pre&s;ently follow'd by the <HI>Syam Magi&s;trates,</HI> exclaiming again&s;t the&s;e Outrages with mo&s;t pa&s;&s;ionate re&s;entments; demanding of me what could induce the Captain thus to violate his Faith &s;o &s;olemnly and publick|ly engag'd to them, in declaring that he would await &s;ixty days for An&s;wer to his pretended demands at <HI>Court;</HI> and now in this manner to break in upon them before a quarter of the time was expir'd. I had only to an&s;wer, That they well knew I was ab&s;ent on the <HI>King</HI>'s Service at <HI>Tena&s;&s;ary,</HI> whence this ill News had recall'd me &s;ome days &s;ooner than intended, &s;o that I was under as great a Con&s;ternation as them&s;elves po&s;&s;ibly could be at the&s;e &s;trange Proceedings; but I had notice the Captain was now coming a Shore, from whom I would fully inform my &s;elf, and communicate to them the truth of what I under&s;tood concerning it, which they told me they &s;hould with im|patience expect, and &s;o with a more than ordinary Fervency, injoyning me to manage my &s;elf in this Affair as my Duty to his <HI>Maje&s;ty</HI> the King of <HI>Syam</HI> ob|lig'd me, they withdrew with much &s;eeming di&s;content and concern'dne&s;s. Some hours after, Captain <HI>Weltden</HI> came to my Hou&s;e, whom I pre&s;ently acco&s;ted as the occa&s;ion requir'd, telling him how much I was a&s;toni&s;h'd at the &s;udden change of things in my few days ab&s;ence; And fir&s;t I tax'd him with the affront and injury done to the <HI>Government</HI> of the Place, wherein he had forfeited his Obligation to them, which he voluntarily enter'd into by his own Pro|po&s;al, and I fear'd &s;o unaccountable an Action might be of pernicious Con|&s;equence. For what dependence could we have on their &s;incerity, when we had led them into the breach of Faith by our Example? And then as to what more particularly related to my &s;elf in his entering my Ship with armed Men, and carrying her under Command of his own, I urg'd to him, That &s;uch Violences did no way accord with his Declaration at his arrival, where|in he a&s;&s;ur'd Us he came not to mole&s;t or injure any of Us, either in our Per&s;ons or E&s;tates, but to protect and a&s;&s;i&s;t Us in all things, as I according|ly confided. But now I found much cau&s;e to doubt that I was not &s;ecure in any thing, wherefore I de&s;ir'd him to let me know the meaning of what he had already done, and what I was to expect for the future? Whereto the Captain was pleas'd to an&s;wer, That I need not trouble my &s;elf &s;o much in this matter, for nothing had been nor &s;hould be done with de&s;ign of pre|judice to my &s;elf or any <HI>Engli&s;hman</HI> on the Place, but only for his own &s;e|curity, which he mu&s;t not be wanting to endeavour; and as to my Ship &s;he was &s;afe, and not le&s;s at my command than when &s;he rid before my own door; the occa&s;ion of his removing her being upon &s;ome intimations he had receiv'd, that he &s;hould be deny'd any more Provi&s;ions from the Shore, and hearing my Ship had good &s;tore aboard for her intended Voyage to <HI>Europe,</HI> he brought her under command of his own for a Recruit in ca&s;e of nece&s;&s;i|ty. I reply'd, That I was very &s;orry he was &s;o ea&s;ily inclin'd to credit &s;uch fal&s;e and groundle&s;s Sugge&s;tions, &s;ince he had not only my repeated Promi&s;es, that nothing the Place could afford &s;hould be wanting to him, but had al&s;o experimented my corre&s;ponding Performances in larger &s;upplies than his oc|ca&s;ions had hitherto requir'd; which he readily and thankfully acknowledg'd, and added, that what was done was <HI>Irrevocably</HI> pa&s;t, but re-a&s;&s;ur'd me I &s;hould not be a Sufferer in any thing.</P>
<P>As to his drawing up the Piles that were plac'd for the defence of the Port he had little to &s;ay, onely that in regard they were not fini&s;h'd be|fore his arrival, he look'd upon it to be again&s;t the Law of Arms for them to go on fortifying in that time he had limited for a Ce&s;&s;ation.</P>
<PB N="4" REF="3">
<P>And as to his &s;ending his People to &s;eize the Boats and Men the <HI>Magi|strates</HI> had employ'd to await without the <HI>Port,</HI> to give advices to the Ships expected from abroad, he would have ju&s;tify'd it by a Reflection on me, &s;aying he was certify'd I was in&s;trumental, or at lea&s;t had &s;ome Cognizance of that matter, and he took it more ill becau&s;e he had formerly in occa&s;ion|al Di&s;cour&s;e, a&s;&s;ur'd me that whatever &s;hould arrive on any bottom, that appear'd to belong to me or any <HI>Engli&s;hman,</HI> &s;hould be duly deliver'd to the Proprietor. I an&s;wer'd him, That as I never doubted his Promi&s;e in that regard, &s;o neither could I have any fears of the contrary; for how great &s;oever the Priviledges were, which the <HI>Companies</HI> potent Influences at <HI>Court</HI> may have prevail'd to obtain of his <HI>Maje&s;ty;</HI> I was heartily &s;atisfy'd that <HI>Our Gracious Sovereign</HI> would not give them a Power to de&s;troy and ruine their fellow Subjects, that were in all things obedient to his <HI>Royal</HI> Commands, as he had found my &s;elf and all with me; wherefore it was no good <HI>Logick</HI> for him to infer from his fore&s;aid Promi&s;e, that I was ob|lig'd to betray my Tru&s;t, in di&s;covering what my Superiors had caus'd to be done in the Affairs of that <HI>Prince</HI> I had the honour and happine&s;s to &s;erve many years; and might, I hop'd, without any &s;tain to my Allegiance to my <HI>Native Sovereign</HI> continue &s;o to do, till War was actually declar'd again&s;t him; Or that in that interim I receiv'd order to &s;urrender up my Charge and Commi&s;&s;ion to a Succe&s;&s;or in my Office. Which was the &s;um of our Conference at this time, The Captain and his Company being plea&s;ed to &s;tay with me till about nine at Night, and then returned aboard his Ship.</P>
<P><HI>July</HI> 12th. Early this Morning the <HI>Magi&s;trates</HI> were again with me, to know what the Captain had offer'd in Ju&s;tification of his &s;trange Actions; to whom I told the real Truth of all that pa&s;s'd betwixt us, which did &s;till further incen&s;e them, urging, that if he had not better pretences for what was already done, they had rea&s;on to fear wor&s;e afterwards. For what au|thority could his coming there with the Companies unrea&s;onable and ground|le&s;s demands give him to interrupt their bu&s;ine&s;s in the <HI>King</HI>'s Service? And to &s;eize a Ship in <HI>Port,</HI> to whom&s;oever &s;he belonged, was yet as much to the <HI>King</HI>'s Di&s;honor, as if it had been his own. I endeavour'd to palliate the matter as well as I could, and per&s;wade them to believe the Captain would offer them no further <HI>Prejudice,</HI> but await the remainer of the limi|ted time for an An&s;wer from <HI>Court.</HI> And here I enquir'd what was the mean|ing of the Fleet of Gallies that I &s;aw ye&s;terday and to day in the River full man'd? They readily told me, it was to prevent the like which had happen|ed, for the future, and &s;oon after parted in a great Di&s;gu&s;t.</P>
<P>In the Afternoon the Captain came again a&s;hore and gave me a Vi&s;it, and at his return aboard in the Evening, when he came to the Waters &s;ide he ob&s;erv'd the pre-mention'd Gallies to move cro&s;s the River, and there|upon &s;ent his <HI>Lieutenant</HI> to me to enquire the rea&s;on, and declare he doubt|ed &s;ome de&s;ign again&s;t him: Which I a&s;&s;ur'd him I was wholly ignorant of, and for his further &s;atisfaction offer'd my &s;elf to accompany him till he was pa&s;t what&s;oever he could &s;uppo&s;e had any appearance of danger; as I accordingly did, and afterwards at his earne&s;t invitation proceeded with him on board his Ship, where I remained till next day Afternoon, and then re|turned to my Hou&s;e, in which interim I found all had continued very quiet, and no news of any further motion by the <HI>Magi&s;trates:</HI> which gave me hopes that what had pa&s;s'd would have only awaken'd them to keep the &s;tricter Guard, and make the be&s;t provi&s;ion they could for their future De|fence. And becau&s;e the Captain had promis'd me he would give them no more &s;uch Provocations, I flatter'd my &s;elf into a plea&s;ing Opinion, that
<PB N="5" REF="3">we &s;hould have been &s;o far Friends again, as to have our Lives &s;ecure from any attempt, at lea&s;t till the &s;ixty days were accompli&s;h'd.</P>
<P>But while I was thus dreaming of Safety, I found my &s;elf and all my Country|men on the brink of De&s;truction; For the very next day, being the 14th of <HI>July,</HI> the Captain, with &s;everal others, coming in the Afternoon to my Hou&s;e, I detain'd them to Supper, and at the u&s;ual hour, betwixt eight and nine of the Clock, he was for returning aboard, when all the Company waited on him to the outward Porch of my Hou&s;e, but I accompany'd him about thirty foot further to the Waters &s;ide, where my Barge lay ready to receive him. And at the very moment of our parting, I was &s;urpriz'd by a &s;udden Blow with a great Club on the Sleeve of my Gown, and turning &s;hort upon the Villain that &s;truck at me, he was &s;o di&s;animated, that he dur&s;t not &s;tay to repeat the &s;troke, but immediately fled from me; though I was de&s;titute of any defence, being only in my Night-gown and Slippers, without Hat or Cap on my head. At the &s;ame in&s;tant the Captain was by a more unfortu|nate Blow from another hand knock'd down, but in little time recover'd him&s;elf, though with the lo&s;s of much Blood: and ju&s;t as we were thus a&s;&s;aulted, I heard a hideous confu&s;ed noi&s;e of a Multitude, which gave me a &s;u&s;picion they were at once a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inating all of our <HI>Nation,</HI> in which di&s;|mal di&s;tre&s;s I fir&s;t thought of retreating to my Hou&s;e, where be&s;ides &s;ix|teen great Guns mounted on a Platform, I had &s;tore of Ammunition and Arms of all &s;orts within doors; but I no &s;ooner mov'd that way, than I di&s;cern'd a great company of armed Men, that were got between me and home, and &s;o I had no other relief but to fly to my Barge, as I did, and pre&s;ently got her off, when I &s;py'd the Captain, and adventur'd to put a&s;hore again to take him in. The Guards which attended him being fourteen Men with a <HI>Lieutenant,</HI> in two Boats, made one di&s;charge, and adventur'd to Land, where they were overpower'd, and all cut off, and &s;o was every <HI>Engli&s;h|man,</HI> (&s;ave four) with &s;ome of other Nations that were our Friends, as I was afterwards certify'd by a <HI>French</HI> Ship from that Place, before I left <HI>India.</HI></P>
<P>The Captain and I, having by a Miracle of Mercy made an E&s;cape thus far, we made all the ha&s;te we could to get aboard our Ships for further &s;e|curity, and in our pa&s;&s;age down I had the additional affliction of &s;eeing my Hou&s;e, Ware-hou&s;es, and Ship-yard all in a Flame: nor were we with|out a Pro&s;pect of encountering new Dangers; for as we proceeded towards our Ships, we had &s;ight of &s;everal <HI>Syam</HI> Boats, which were laid to inter|cept any that &s;hould e&s;cape from the Shore; and it was with much diffi|culty that we pa&s;s'd by them undi&s;cover'd, till at la&s;t we arriv'd at the Place where the Ships rode the day before; but to our great Amazement they now appear'd not: Which after all former fears, ca&s;t us quite into de|&s;pair, concluding &s;ome fatal Di&s;ta&s;ter had al&s;o befallen them, and &s;o depriv'd us of all po&s;&s;ibility of &s;aving our &s;elves. However, that we might live as long as we could, we re&s;olv'd to make down with the Tide, which then happily favour'd us, to be farther from the Town at break of day. And under this doleful Con&s;ternation, while we &s;eem'd &s;urrounded with Deaths on all &s;ides, having only to choo&s;e whether we would return to be kill'd, or proceed to be &s;tarv'd or drown'd: As we row'd along we de&s;cry'd &s;omething that loom'd like a Ship, which in two hours hard Rowing we came up with, and &s;he gave us new Life in proving to be my Ship <HI>Re&s;olu|tion,</HI> where we found Captain <HI>Go&s;tlin</HI> Commander of the <HI>Sloop James,</HI> with his Mate who e&s;cap'd in their Boat, and carry'd down the fir&s;t &s;ad News of the <HI>Bloody Tragedy;</HI> upon which the <HI>Curtana</HI> and my Ship cut their Cables,
<PB N="6" REF="4">and &s;tood out over the <HI>Bar,</HI> where we happily got aboard about three of the Clock in the Morning, the <HI>Curtana</HI> being then about two Leagues from us, and &s;till under Sail, wherefore we fired our fore-Cha&s;e, as a &s;ign for them to Anchor, and about four of the Clock &s;ent a Boat for the Doctor to dre&s;s the Captains Wounds, who about &s;even was returned again with Or|ders to the Mates, that they &s;hould bring the Ship nearer mine: but they were all &s;o full of fear, that they took no notice of it, but as &s;oon as the Tide pre&s;ented, they weigh'd and &s;tood directly for the Channel, with the <HI>King</HI>'s Colours flying; and it was certainly the want of Wind, and not of good Will, that prevented their running away with the Ship, and gave the Captain opportunity of overtaking them in my Long-boat about &s;even at Night, at which time he got &s;afely aboard the <HI>Curtana.</HI></P>
<P>THIS is a faithful Relation of all that pa&s;&s;ed under my Cognizance in this di&s;mal Cata&s;trophe, wherein, by a miraculous Providence, I e&s;cap'd with my Life, but was at once depriv'd of a very con&s;iderable E&s;tate I had alrea|dy acquir'd, and a fair Pro&s;pect of a far greater addition to it: And what ought not to be a le&s;s trouble to my Mind, is, that by means of the&s;e un|accountable proceedings at <HI>Mergen,</HI> I have lo&s;t my <HI>Intere&s;t</HI> in the Favour of one of the be&s;t <HI>Princes</HI> in the World, and lie at pre&s;ent under the un|de&s;erved cen&s;ure of having been treacherous to his <HI>Intere&s;t,</HI> by who&s;e <HI>Gracious Indulgence</HI> I was advanc'd as much above my expectation as de|&s;ert; And moreover had a&s;&s;urance that his <HI>Royal</HI> Bounty and Goodne&s;s &s;till de&s;ign'd to have done greater things for me: For how &s;trange &s;oever it may appear to tho&s;e who know my unworthine&s;s of &s;o high an Honour, yet in a grateful Recognition of my Obligations, I will tell the truth, in declaring that I &s;tood regi&s;tred in his <HI>Maje&s;ties</HI> Decrees to have &s;ucceeded my <HI>Lord Phaulkon</HI> in the prime Mini&s;try of the Affairs of the Kingdom. But yet all this that relates to my particular Misfortunes, is not worthy of a Thought, when I reflect how much the Dignity of <HI>Our Sovereign Lord</HI> the <HI>King</HI> has &s;uffer'd, and what irreparable prejudice has been done to the Honour and Intere&s;t of the <HI>Nation,</HI> by tho&s;e &s;trange mea&s;ures have been lately taken in re&s;pect to <HI>Syam,</HI> and &s;ome other parts of <HI>India,</HI> which have not only ruin'd me and &s;everal others in our E&s;tates, but de&s;troy'd the Lives of many of his <HI>Maje&s;ties</HI> u&s;eful Subjects. And the&s;e are yet but the beginnings of our Sorrows, for the ill Effects of our new Enterprizes, will be felt by Po&s;terity in an entire Lo&s;s of that noble and beneficial Commerce, unle&s;s &s;ome &s;peedy and effectual Cour&s;e be taken to retrieve and pre&s;erve it, which I hope will be accordingly con&s;idered by <HI>HIM</HI> or Them, who have been the occa&s;ion of what I have here related of the Blood-&s;hed and Mi&s;ery of their poor di&s;tre&s;&s;ed Countrymen at <HI>Mergen;</HI> For the guilt thereof is much more imputable to them than the <HI>Syamers,</HI> who in regard to the Provocations and Apprehen&s;ions they were under, are in great mea&s;ure excu&s;able. For not to &s;ay any thing here of the grounds of our Companies quarrel with <HI>Syam,</HI> or their &s;trange manner of pro&s;ecuting it. I am now only to take notice of this particular Expe|dition, which happening in that Place where I had &s;o great a &s;hare in the Government, and con&s;equently a Power to di&s;po&s;e matters according to my Inclinations; In the fir&s;t place my being an <HI>Engli&s;hman</HI> was e|nough at that Juncture to make the Natives &s;omething jealous of me: And then the re&s;pect that I paid to the Authority of <HI>Our Sovereign Lord</HI> the <HI>King</HI> in my friendly Reception of the Captain who had his Commi&s;&s;ion, with my dutiful Obedience to his <HI>Boyal</HI> Command in di&s;mi&s;&s;ing all my
<PB N="7" REF="4"><HI>Countrymen</HI> from the <HI>King of Syam</HI>'s Service, might very rea&s;onably en|crea&s;e their &s;u&s;picions. Nor was it a &s;mall inducement to their further doubts, that the Company were pleas'd to employ &s;o de&s;picable a Force for &s;o con&s;iderable an Attempt, which might ju&s;tly incline them to pre|&s;ume there was &s;ome dependence on my &s;elf and tho&s;e under my Com|mand. For to &s;end no more than one little Ship of 100 Tuns, and a Sloop of 30 Tuns, with a few <HI>Europeans</HI> on them both, and to de&s;ign &s;o great a Work with this little Armado, as to block up the <HI>Port,</HI> and take all the Ships, was &s;o prodigious an Exploit, that it a&s;toni&s;h'd the <HI>Syamers,</HI> and will, I believe, cau&s;e great admiration in others. To which I mu&s;t add, that the <HI>Moors, Portuguezes,</HI> and a few <HI>Dutch</HI> that re&s;ided there, who were always very envious of our flouri&s;hing &s;ettlement at that Place, could not po&s;&s;ibly have wi&s;h'd for a fitter opportunity to undermine our <HI>Inte|re&s;t;</HI> and I am very certain they did indu&s;triou&s;ly improve it, in repre&s;ent|ing and aggravating every thing to our greate&s;t di&s;advantage. But yet after all, I am well a&s;&s;ur'd the <HI>Syamers,</HI> could never have been tran&s;port|ed to that bloody Fury, had not the&s;e unhappy Actions of Captain <HI>Welt|den</HI> confirm'd their former Fears, and put them upon doing that Vio|lence to &s;ecure them&s;elves from the <HI>Con&s;piracy</HI> they concluded was form'd again&s;t them by all the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> at that Place. Nor mu&s;t I omit to intimate, that the Captain did afterwards, with great concern and trouble, acknow|ledge he was &s;en&s;ible of his unhappy Inadvertencies, declaring he had been betray'd by the fal&s;e Sugge&s;tions and evil Advice of &s;ome treacherous Per&s;ons he too much confided in.</P>

<P>ANd here at the clo&s;e I beg leave to add a Word or two in Reflection on that fal&s;e and &s;candalous News was put into the <HI>Gazette</HI> the 26th of <HI>July</HI> pa&s;t, the Words are the&s;e, <HI>The Letters likewi&s;e add, that at</HI> Tena&s;&s;a|ry <HI>and</HI> Mergy, <HI>belonging to the</HI> King <HI>of</HI> Syam, <HI>the</HI> Engli&s;h <HI>Fugitives, and Relicts of the late Interloping Faction that fled to</HI> Phaulkon<HI>'s a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and were employed by him in the</HI> King <HI>of</HI> Syam<HI>'s Service, being fifty &s;even Per&s;ons were all cut off by an In&s;urrection of</HI> 600 <HI>of the Natives, with their Governor</HI> Burneby, <HI>a treacherous De&s;erter from the Companies Service, &s;uppo&s;ed to have been corrupted by</HI> Phaulkon <HI>when</HI> Burneby <HI>was Chief for the</HI> Company <HI>at</HI> Syam, <HI>none e&s;caped with Life, but Mr.</HI> White, Governour <HI>of</HI> Mergen <HI>for the</HI> King <HI>of</HI> Syam, <HI>and he by &s;wimming off to a &s;mall Ship of the</HI> Compa|nies <HI>riding near</HI> Mergy, <HI>that &s;aved and relieved him, notwith&s;tanding his for|mer mi&s;carriages, by giving him a &s;mall Prize Ship in which he &s;ailed for, and arrived at the Cape, and (it is thought) will come from thence to</HI> Europe <HI>in &s;ome of the</HI> Dutch Ea&s;t-India <HI>Ships, the &s;mall Ship being not fitted for a</HI> Europe <HI>Voyage.</HI></P>
<P>This is the Paragraph, and 'tis really great pity the Authors Name was not affix'd to it, whereby we might know who he is among&s;t Mankind that dares with &s;uch audacious effrontery impo&s;e on the Publick. I can|not readily imagine what &s;hould tempt any Man to &s;uch a Crime, unle&s;s it be &s;ome body who is con&s;cious to him&s;elf, he has been the fundamental occa&s;ion of all that Blood and Ruine at <HI>Mergen,</HI> and now hopes by this ca|lumnious Forgery to cover his Guilt from the cognizance of the World. And certainly it mu&s;t be &s;ome &s;uch Per&s;on that fram'd this Story, wherein there is not the lea&s;t &s;emblance of Truth, &s;aving that he has hit about the number of them that were &s;lain: but then to wound their Names after they had &s;o unhappily lo&s;t their Lives, in a mo&s;t fal&s;e and groundle&s;s accu&s;ing them
<PB N="8" REF="5">to have been <HI>Interlopers</HI> and <HI>Fugitives,</HI> &s;peaks the Author to have more of the Cruelty of a <HI>Canibal</HI> than the Charity of a Chri&s;tian. For fir&s;t, I dare affirm to the Author's face, and can te&s;tifie to the World, that near one third of them that fell, were the very Men that came on the <HI>Curtana</HI> to fight the Com|panies Battels, and among&s;t all the re&s;t, there was no more than one &s;in|gle Per&s;on that came out in an Interloping Ship, the others being generally &s;uch as had re&s;ided &s;ome years in the Country, and &s;everal of them came the preceding year from <HI>Madra&s;s</HI> by leave of the <HI>Pre&s;ident</HI> and <HI>Council,</HI> to &s;erve the <HI>King</HI> of <HI>Syam</HI> in his Wars with <HI>Golcondah</HI> and <HI>Pegu.</HI> But I ob&s;erve our Author doth in this malicious mi&s;repre&s;entation, &s;pit his ve|nom more directly at that unfortunate Man Mr. <HI>Richard Burneby,</HI> whom he brands with the black Character of a <HI>Treacherous De&s;erter,</HI> which is &s;o no|torious a Slander, that any mode&s;t Man alive, but our Author, would be a&s;ham'd &s;o ba&s;ely to traduce a poor dead Man, and add new Grief to the affliction of his di&s;tre&s;&s;ed Widow and Fatherle&s;s Children. For Mr. <HI>Burneby</HI>'s Ca&s;e was in one Word this; He &s;erv'd the Company in place of their Chief at the Factory of <HI>Syam</HI> about two years, and Mr. <HI>George Go&s;sfright</HI> coming thither as Supervi&s;or from the Agency, <HI>Anno</HI> 81. he found &s;ome faults in his Management; (which by the way I mu&s;t do him right, to declare, were at wor&s;t but Errors in his Judgment, not his Will) but however he was di&s;plac'd, and went with Mr. <HI>Go&s;sfright</HI> to <HI>Bantam,</HI> where he was di&s;charg'd from the Companies Service by the Council, that then managed their Affairs, and after &s;ome Months &s;tay there, and at <HI>Batavia,</HI> he did with their leave return on a <HI>Dutch</HI> Ship to <HI>Syam.</HI> And as to that ingrateful in&s;inuation of his being corrupted by <HI>Phaulkon,</HI> all I will now &s;ay of it, is, That it is like the many other returns have been made to that <HI>Honourable Per&s;on</HI> my <HI>Lord Phaulkon,</HI> for his great Favours to the Nation in general, and &s;everal of <HI>Our Countrymen</HI> in particular.</P>
<P>And now to conclude, As to tho&s;e Sugge&s;tions concerning my &s;elf, <HI>That I &s;aved my Life by &s;wimming aboard one of the Companies Ships, and their Servants did not only relieve me, but nottwith&s;tanding my former Mi&s;carriages were &s;o kind to give me a &s;mall Prize, on which I arrived at the Cape.</HI> I re|fer to the true account I have given in this Paper of all that pa&s;s'd in tho&s;e Extremities, for a full Confutation of the&s;e Fictions, and will only add; That when I am accus'd of my pretended Mi&s;carriages, I will render any rea&s;o|nable &s;atisfaction for whatever can be prov'd again&s;t me, as I al&s;o pre&s;ume to expect the Company will at length be pleas'd to give me thanks at lea&s;t for tho&s;e good Services they already know I have done them. But if after all, it be impo&s;&s;ible to merit &s;o much favour at their hands; <HI>how|ever,</HI> &s;ince God has in great Mercy been pleas'd, after I have pa&s;t through &s;o many Dangers and Mi&s;eries, to bring me home alive on a Ship of my own, to which I have as good a Title as the Author can pretend to any thing he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es in the World; I hope, that when I have recover'd that con&s;iderable E&s;tate which the Companies Servants have with mo&s;t inhumane Violence taken from me, and obtain'd &s;atisfaction for tho&s;e va&s;t Lo&s;&s;es and Injuries I &s;u&s;tain'd by their Ho&s;tile Attempts at <HI>Mergen;</HI> I &s;hall be en|abl'd to provide my &s;elf with Ships, and all things el&s;e that my Occa&s;ions require, without being beholden to the Author or his Accomplices.</P>
