<P>But far from me be the pre&s;umption to direct Your Lord&s;hips Judgement of his Exploits, ei|ther in the Camp, or Cabinet; either of his Sword, or Pen; which I was principally induced to publi&s;h in our Language, by &s;ome pa&s;&s;ages tending to the Vindication of our late incompa|rable King, and Martyr, from no le&s;s fal&s;e, than foule a&s;per&s;ions concerning <HI>Rochelle,</HI> (His care and diligence to order their relief, being here ac|knowledged by per&s;ons more concerned, than our pretended Propagators of Religion, the <HI>Ro|chellers</HI> ruine being chiefly occa&s;ioned by their own Incon&s;tancy, refu&s;ing to admit tho&s;e &s;uc|cours when come, which they before, even with tears implored, and their own inte&s;tine divi&s;ions and factions) with which His Bla&s;phemous, and Rebellious Subjects, fir&s;t &s;ought to wound His Fame, that with more &s;ecurity they might im|brew

<HEAD>THE AUTHOR'S PREFACE TO THE Reader.</HEAD>
<P>_THIS Treati&s;e pre&s;ents you with the Hi|&s;tory of three Wars &s;u&s;tained in <HI>France,</HI> in defence of the Reformed Churches there; the occa&s;ion of the fir&s;t was <HI>Bearne;</HI> that of the &s;econd, the not ob&s;erving the Peace made at <HI>Montpellier;</HI> and that of the third, was the hope to &s;ave <HI>Rochelle:</HI> But our &s;ins fought again&s;t us; for in&s;tead of profiting, we were hardned by the cha&s;ti&s;ements God &s;ent us. In the two fir&s;t Wars, the divi&s;ions appeared but as &s;cattered sparks, which in the la&s;t united to make a general confla|gration, there being no place, where Corruption had not &s;eated it &s;elf, and Avarice excluded Piety; &s;o that in|&s;tead of expecting any overtures from our enemies, every one pro&s;titut<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">d him&s;elf to &s;ell his Religion, and betray his Countrey: Our Ance&s;tours would have cru&s;hed &s;uch chil|dren in their Cradles, had they thought they would have proved in&s;truments of ruine to tho&s;e Churches which they had planted in the mid'&s;t of Flames, and cheri&s;hed in de|&s;pight of Torments; and who by their indefatigable pains, and per&s;everance, had left them po&s;&s;e&s;sors of a glorious
<PB REF="4">
Repo&s;e: Nor will our Po&s;terity ea&s;ily believe them&s;elves de&s;cended from &s;uch Noble Grandfathers, and &s;uch In|famous Fathers, if they look not higher, to wit, to God, who rai&s;es, and abates the Courages of men, according as his good plea&s;ure is to di&s;cover his Wonders to his Church, in rai&s;ing it from the du&s;t; when the powers of the world conceive it buried there, and depre&s;&s;ing it again, when Pride, and an Abu&s;e of his Graces, are the only Product of them.</P>
<P>And here I &s;peak to you Princes, and Common-wealths, whom God hath honoured with his Knowledge, ble&s;t with his Favours, advanced to the height of Dignity, and even &s;atiated with Riches; take warning by us, and boa&s;t not your &s;elves in the Arme of fle&s;h, and the greatne&s;s of your Forces; in the height of your Pro&s;perity beware a Fall; for then are you neare&s;t danger: Many of you have with dry Eyes, and lethargique Arms, been Spectators of our Tragedy, without contributing any thing to our re|lief; and we our Selves, have &s;een the Ships, and Ar|mies of others ingratefully promoting the ruine of tho&s;e, who relioved them in their nece&s;&s;ity: God will not fail to do his work without you, when the time of our deliverance &s;hall come; He is nearer to us in our Adver&s;ity, than you are to him in your Pro&s;perity; if we are obliged to implore his Favour, you are much more to prevent his Judgments. Let the examples of others be your in&s;truction, and while it is yet time, con&s;ider from what &s;ource your ble&s;&s;ings flow, and give the honour and glory of it to him, to whom it is only due. In the mean time, prepare your &s;elves to &s;ee here, without any di&s;gui&s;e, the naked truth of what pa&s;|&s;ed in our late trouble.</P>
<P>I have begun this Hi&s;tory at the death of <HI>Henry</HI> the Great; for that during the minority of the King, his Son, the Maximes laid down by the Father, for the Go|vernment of <HI>France,</HI> were changed, and the foundation of the per&s;ecution of tho&s;e of the Reformed Religion laid,
<PB REF="5">
which had like al&s;o to have proved the &s;ubver&s;ion of all <HI>Chri&s;tendome,</HI> and given its Monarchy to the hou&s;e of <HI>Au&s;tria.</HI></P>
<P>I leave it to Po&s;terity, to the end, that after my death, the truth of things which I have &s;een, may not be ob&s;cu|red, either by the Fables of Flatterers, or the Invectives of our Per&s;ecutors: I have done it, without any the lea&s;t Fiction, or Pa&s;&s;ion, and &s;hall leave every man his liberty to judge of it, as he &s;hall plea&s;e.</P>

<HEAD>The fir&s;t Book. Containing the troubles during the minority of the King.</HEAD>
<P>_AFter the death of <HI>Henry</HI> the Great, every one be|gan to think of his own affairs, the <HI>Queen</HI> to e&s;ta|bli&s;h her authority, the <HI>chief Mini&s;ters</HI> of <HI>State</HI> to maintain their own, by advancing hers, as being the ea&s;ie&s;t to be effected (by rea&s;on of the ab&s;ence of the fir&s;t Prince of the blood, the im|becillity of the &s;econd, and the misunder&s;tanding that was be|tween the third and them:) and the other great ones to rai&s;e them|&s;elves
<PB N="2" REF="6">
from that abject condition, the precedent raign had ca&s;t them into. Amid'&s;t all which, hatreds were frequent, and the mo&s;t &s;ubtle among them made u&s;e of the pa&s;&s;ion of others to ru|ine the authority of tho&s;e that eclip&s;ed theirs.</P>
<P>He that received the fir&s;t &s;hock, after the Regency was &s;ettled on the Queen, was the Duke of <HI>Sully,</HI> who by his &s;ervices had ac|quired the honour of <HI>Principal Confident</HI> to the former King, and purcha&s;ed the ill-will of mo&s;t others: For a vertue, eminent, as was his, accompanied with the favour of his Ma&s;ter, is alwayes at|tended on by envie, a vice as frequent among men, as unworthy tho&s;e who pretend any profe&s;&s;ion of honour. Many were very zealous for his ruine, and that for different rea&s;ons; The Chan|cellor <HI>Villeroy,</HI> and the Pre&s;ident <HI>Janin,</HI> to confirm their own power in the government of the State, and take from among them a Man, who&s;e exactne&s;&s;e in the di&s;charge of his Offices was their &s;hame, &s;o clear-&s;ighted to di&s;cern, and &s;o bold to di&s;cover their faults; The Count of <HI>Soi&s;&s;ons</HI> out of &s;ome particular hatred he bore him: The Marque&s;&s;e <HI>d' Ancre</HI> for fear he &s;hould nip his bud|ding fortune; and all the other Grandees, becau&s;e they thought him too good a mannager of the Publick trea&s;ure; And the Prince of <HI>Conde</HI> when he came to the Court, by the in&s;tigation of the Mar&s;hal <HI>Bo&uuml;illon,</HI> who bore him an inveterate malice, and drew on the Prince with hopes of confi&s;cating his goods: A powerful mo|tive to &s;et that Prince on work.</P>
<P>The chiefe&s;t means they u&s;ed to remove him from the helme, were, to rai&s;e a jealou&s;ie in the Queen of the au&s;terity of his hu|mour, who oppo&s;ed her in her liberalities; and to per&s;wade her, that, having need of the Popes favour to &s;trengthen her authori|ty, &s;he could not &s;uffer one of the Reformed Religion, to have any hand in the Government of the State; Prevalent rea&s;ons with a Prince&s;s, who was a Forraigner little ver&s;ed in State matters, jealous of her authority, and di&s;tru&s;tful of all &s;orts of people: But in the end experience di&s;covered it to be the ruine of the State; For the Grandees grew up to a height that dimini&s;hed the Royal power; the Trea&s;uries were drained, the Ar&s;enals &s;trangely di|&s;per&s;ed, and the compari&s;on of that mi&s;erable condition of <HI>France</HI> with that flouri&s;hing one, the Duke of <HI>Sully</HI> left it in, clearly de|mon&s;trates, how highly prejudicial to the State, was his removal from his employments in it.</P>
<P>The Mar&s;hal <HI>Bo&uuml;illon,</HI> a man of great courage and under&s;tand|ing, able to procure great good, and no le&s;&s;e mi&s;chief to a <HI>Com|mon-wealth,</HI> and who had been alwayes curbed by the late King, who was jealous of him, finding him&s;elf now at liberty, u&s;es all manner of inventions, to make him&s;elf thought u&s;eful, and nece&s;|&s;ary:
<PB N="3" REF="6">
The fir&s;t was to endeavour wholly to po&s;&s;e&s;&s;e the &s;pirit of the Prince of <HI>Conde,</HI> who&s;e kin&s;man he was, and to per&s;wade him to become one of the Reformation, by that means to make him&s;elf the Chief, and Protector of a party, that was then very con&s;idera|ble; and with &s;uch indu&s;try carryed he on his Plots, that the Queen conceived great &s;u&s;pitions of him; and therefore to divert this blow, &s;ought after him, who as &s;oone as he had made his conditi|ons with her, effaces the de&s;ires he had infu&s;ed into the Prince, to imitate the vertuous actions of his Ance&s;tors; &s;hewing him the thornes were in the way to honour, the perils, hard&s;hips and ad|ver&s;e accidents are met withal, in the pur&s;uit of it; In &s;hort, the mi&s;ery and poverty that accompany it, which proved mo&s;t effectu|all rea&s;ons to di&s;&s;wade him from a de&s;igne &s;o contrary to his nature.</P>
<P>The Duke of <HI>Rohan</HI> in the mean time, who was Colonel of the <HI>Switzers,</HI> was commanded away to the &s;iege of <HI>Juilliers,</HI> taking with him a Regiment of the <HI>Switzers,</HI> and having the command of the French Army in the ab&s;ence of the Mar&s;hal <HI>de la Cha&s;tre,</HI> who was the Lieutenant General. At his return from this expedition, he finds how cruelly they oppre&s;&s;e his Father-in-Law the Duke of <HI>Sully;</HI> and that, after they had taken from him the <HI>Ba&s;tille,</HI> to di|&s;po&s;e of the trea&s;ure in it, and his command of the <HI>Finances,</HI> to rob <HI>France</HI> with fuller liberty, they were now re&s;olved upon his ut|ter de&s;truction, &s;o to deprive him of all means to re&s;ent &s;uch indig|nities: But &s;eeing that it was beyond their skill by any ordinary wayes to blemi&s;h the admini&s;tration of any of his Offices, the Mar&s;hal <HI>Bo&uuml;illon,</HI> who had infected the Prince of <HI>Conde,</HI> and the Count of <HI>Soi&s;&s;ons</HI> with the &s;ame malitious intention, contrived this de&s;igne for his ruine, <HI>viz.</HI> to procure a General A&s;&s;embly of tho&s;e of the Religion, which was granted to be held at <HI>Cha&s;telle|raut</HI> on the five and twentieth of <HI>May,</HI> in the year 1611, in which he promi&s;ed him&s;elf power enough to cau&s;e the Duke of <HI>Sully</HI> to be entirely abandoned, &s;o that without any fear of tho&s;e of the Religion, he might be arraigned before Commi&s;&s;ioners impowered for his trial; and moreover, that by his indu&s;try he &s;hould &s;o or|der the A&s;&s;embly, and all the affairs of the Reformed party, that he &s;hould make him&s;elf the only man con&s;iderable: To bring this Project to pa&s;&s;e, he vailes it with a pretence of much affection to tho&s;e of the Reformation, and large promi&s;es of an <HI>Amelioration</HI> in their affairs; and communicates it to the Mar&s;hal <HI>de Le&s;di|guieres,</HI> and <HI>Du Ple&s;&s;is Mornay</HI> in particular, by <HI>Bellugeon</HI> an atten|dant of <HI>Le&s;diguieres,</HI> who when he had been with them, returnes with the&s;e following In&s;tructions from <HI>Du Ple&s;&s;is.</HI></P>

to fo&s;ter fears of the i&s;&s;ue of this A&s;&s;embly, and finde out meanes to render it ineffectual: His de&s;ires in this met a wi&s;hed &s;ucce&s;s; for at his return he treated fully with <HI>Villeroy,</HI> and having made his conditions for the Government of <HI>Poictou,</HI> worth three hun|dred thou&s;and Livers, either for him&s;elf, or to be di&s;po&s;ed of as he &s;hould order, and a hundred thou&s;and Livers augmentation upon the Taxes of the common people, which by his appointment were di&s;po&s;ed to &s;everal particular per&s;ons: he promi&s;es to change all the re&s;olutions of the A&s;&s;embly, and give it &s;uch an i&s;&s;ue, as &s;hould highly content the Queen; which he confirmed by an irre|fragable Te&s;timony; for revi&s;iting the afore&s;aid Emba&s;&s;adours, and particularly <HI>Ar&s;ens,</HI> he begins a di&s;cour&s;e concerning tho&s;e of the Reformation, quite contrary to his former before his Voy|age to <HI>Sedan, viz.</HI> That during the Kings Minority they were better entertain a little patience, than thoughts of bettering their condition, and by that means ju&s;tly purcha&s;e the Kings favour; that for his part he went to the A&s;&s;embly with thoughts tending only to peace, and wholly bent to endeavour a &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion of all to the plea&s;ure of the Court. This much a&s;toni&s;hed <HI>Ar&s;ens,</HI> who conceived now that his compo&s;ition was made, which he di&s;&s;em|bled not at all to his friends: When he had made this progre&s;s, his favourites and creatures &s;econded it with di&s;cour&s;es of the &s;ame nature, the better at a di&s;tance to di&s;po&s;e the people to a compli|ance with his de&s;ires: And becau&s;e <HI>Cha&s;telleraut</HI> was within the Government of the Duke of <HI>Sully,</HI> who&s;e ruine he thir&s;ted after, he cau&s;ed the A&s;&s;embly to adjourn from thence to <HI>Saumure,</HI> the gover|ment of <HI>Du Ple&s;&s;is,</HI> that he might the more oblige him to a con|junction with him.</P>
<P>Before the Se&s;&s;ion of the A&s;&s;embly, he informs <HI>Du Ple&s;&s;is</HI> by &s;everal per&s;ons of quality that he would not be Pre&s;ident of it; that though they elected him, yet would he not accept of the charge, and that it was his de&s;ire, he &s;hould impart this his re|&s;olution to all he &s;hould &s;ee; for that he thought it very impro|per for any of the great ones to undertake it. This extreamely plea&s;ed them all, e&s;pecially the Dukes of <HI>Rohan</HI> and <HI>Sully,</HI> who now ca&s;t their eyes upon <HI>Du Ple&s;&s;is,</HI> and a&s;&s;ured him that they would carry it for him: But the Mar&s;hal <HI>Bo&uuml;illon,</HI> coming the la&s;t of all, and after they had waited for him a day beyond the time prefixed, (though not without much murmurings, for that his mi&s;chievous de&s;ignes began now to be di&s;covered) vi&s;its <HI>Du Ple&s;&s;is,</HI> and tells him, that notwith&s;tanding what had been &s;aid concerning the Pre&s;ident&s;hip, he now de&s;ired their nomination, for that he knew the Duke of <HI>Sully</HI> had with much boa&s;ting threa|tened to prevent him of it; that it was a thing that his many &s;er|vices
<PB N="7" REF="8">
to the Party had merited of them; and that in ca&s;e they re|fu&s;ed him the honour, he would be gone the next morning: This change of his minde wrought no alteration at all in the re|&s;olutions of the Dukes, who found the greate&s;t part of the Provin|ces di&s;po&s;ed to their inclinations; &s;o that whatever &s;uit or parties the Mar&s;hal <HI>Bo&uuml;illon</HI> could make, he had the voices but of &s;ix Provinces, and <HI>Du Ple&s;&s;is</HI> of ten; who when he took his place, had <HI>Chamier</HI> a Mini&s;ter, cho&s;en for his a&s;&s;i&s;tant, and <HI>Desbordes Mercier</HI> for Secretary. This election &s;o nettled <HI>De Bo&uuml;illon,</HI> that returning to his Lodging he brake forth into words of di&s;gu&s;t, and threats of vengeance again&s;t all tho&s;e that had hindred him of the Pre&s;ident&s;hip; finding well by this E&s;&s;ay, that he was now like to faile of all he had promi&s;ed him&s;elf from the A&s;&s;embly: However, obliged both by prudence, and the importunate &s;olli|citations of tho&s;e that were equally friends to them both, he recon|ciled him&s;elf to the Duke of <HI>Sully,</HI> whom he had before declared to be his greate&s;t enemy.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t thing the A&s;&s;embly took into their con&s;ideration, was the di&s;order committed at <HI>Chastillon,</HI> contrary to the expre&s;s Or|ders of the Mar&s;hal <HI>Bo&uuml;illon</HI> and the <HI>Sieur Frere</HI> Commi&s;&s;ioners appointed by the King for that particular affaire, for which the Mar&s;hal pretended &s;o high a di&s;plea&s;ure, that having di&s;patch'd thither <HI>Beauchamp,</HI> one of his Gentlemen, to enquire into the truth of the matter, he declared as his opinion, that it was fit the A&s;&s;embly &s;hould choo&s;e <HI>Senas</HI> for their Deputy, to be &s;ent to the Court with full in&s;tructions, and a &s;trict charge to declare, That they would not treat of any thing with the Kings Commi&s;&s;i|oners, before reparation were made for that wrong: But that violent heat quickly abated; for he pre&s;ently excu&s;ed him&s;elf from medling any further in it, becau&s;e his Commi&s;&s;ion was expired.</P>
<P>After this the Kings Commi&s;&s;ioners had audience, who in all their di&s;cour&s;es pretended, that the pre&s;ervation of tho&s;e of the Re|formed Religion was involved with, and nece&s;&s;ary to that of the State, a&s;&s;uring them of their Maje&s;ties favour, that they would graciou&s;ly receive all their Remon&s;trances and Petitions, cau&s;e their Edicts and Conce&s;&s;ions to be ob&s;erved, put tho&s;e that had hitherto been neglected, in execution; and interpret to their ad|vantage, what was ob&s;cure in them. And la&s;tly, That they left it to the choice of the A&s;&s;embly, either to put their Papers into their hands, or &s;end them to the Court, prote&s;ting, that which way &s;oever they took, they &s;hould have a quick and favourable di&s;patch.</P>
<P>From the&s;e fair promi&s;es &s;prung no le&s;s fair hopes; and ac|cording
<PB N="8" REF="9">
to the in&s;tructions of the Provinces, were their papers prepared; the Mar&s;hal <HI>Bo&uuml;illon</HI> not oppo&s;ing one Article, having been the Author of tho&s;e Propo&s;itions, which were put into the hands of <HI>Lu&s;ignan, Aubigny,</HI> and the other Deputies to exhibite the principal points of them to the Kings Commi&s;&s;ioners, who, af|ter &s;ome debate declared, that they had not power to determine any thing concerning them: But going to the A&s;&s;embly, advi&s;ed them to make their addre&s;&s;es by Deputies to the King, to whom they would do them all good Offices; which was concluded on. At the election of the Deputies, there happened a great &s;tirre, oc|ca&s;ioned by the oppo&s;ition of contrary factions, which made the A&s;&s;embly re&s;olve not to draw up their In&s;tructions and Commi&s;&s;i|ons, before their nomination; that &s;o they might either inlarge or re&s;traine them according to the conditions of the per&s;ons cho|&s;en, who were <HI>La Ca&s;e, Courtaumer, Ferrier</HI> the Mini&s;ter, <HI>Mi|rande</HI> and <HI>Armet,</HI> who had no power to conclude any thing, but only to debate the propo&s;itions; and having explained them, to give an account of all to the A&s;&s;embly, who would return them their re&s;olutions thereupon: This re&s;triction plea&s;ed not all the Deputies, much le&s;s the Mar&s;hal <HI>Bouillon,</HI> who now plainly percei|ved, that his de&s;ign was broken.</P>
<P>While they were preparing their papers, there fell out two particular things worthy the ob&s;erving. The fir&s;t was on the &s;eve|ral oppo&s;itions the Mar&s;hal <HI>Bo&uuml;illon</HI> made to an Article, which the Duke of <HI>Sully</HI> as earne&s;tly pre&s;&s;ed, <HI>viz.</HI> That the A&s;&s;embly &s;hould intere&s;s them&s;elves in his cau&s;e, for that they endeavoured to deprive him of his offices for no other cau&s;e, but of his Religi|on, in which the Mar&s;hal proceeded &s;o farre, as an attempt to make the &s;on renounce his Obligations to his Father-in-law, which he violently pur&s;ued; e&s;pecially one time going to vi&s;it him being &s;ick, telling him that it was impo&s;&s;ible, but that in the admini|&s;tration of tho&s;e great charges he had borne, e&s;pecially in that of the <HI>Finances,</HI> when he was Comptroler of the Exchequer, there &s;hould be found &s;ome faults committed; though not by him, yet by his Officers and Servants; and that if the King &s;hould i&s;&s;ue out a Commi&s;&s;ion to examine his actions, neither the A&s;&s;embly, nor any other of the Reformed Religion ought to be offended at it; no, though the Commi&s;&s;ioners &s;hould do him wrong, &s;ince it would be by the ordinary wayes of Ju&s;tice that he received it, and that he thought the Duke of <HI>Rohan</HI> &s;o hone&s;t a man, a true <HI>French</HI> man, and &s;o great a friend to peace, that he would be nothing moved at it. This &s;peech was but ill-received, and no better an|&s;wered by the Duke, who told him, that the Duke of <HI>Sully's</HI> im|portant &s;ervices de&s;erved a better recompence, than to be expo&s;ed,
<PB N="9" REF="9">
as a prey to tho&s;e that had di&s;&s;erved the State; that his actions in di&s;charge of his Offices, free from all corruption, and mi&s;de|meanour, could not, by rea&s;on of his qualitie, be inquired into, but by a Court of Peers; and that if he were otherwi&s;e dealt withal, all his kindred, and e&s;pecially he, his &s;on in Law, with all their friends, would engage in his cau&s;e; &s;o that after &s;everal Se&s;|&s;ions, the A&s;&s;embly proceeding to a determination of that Arti|cle, &s;o much urged by the Provinces al&s;o, advi&s;ed the Duke of <HI>Sully</HI> not to accept of money in lieu of his Offices, and e&s;pecially, not to quit that of Grand Ma&s;ter of the Artillery, promi&s;ing with|al, that if for that end they &s;hould u&s;e any undue, unlawful, and extraordinary procedures again&s;t him, they would publickly De|clare that they looked on the Duke of <HI>Sully's,</HI> as the &s;ame with the general intere&s;t of the Churches, and of Ju&s;tice; and that therefore they were re&s;olved by all ju&s;t and lawful means to a&s;&s;i&s;t him: And of this the Deputies general had an expre&s;s charge given them in their in&s;tructions.</P>
<P>The other was concerning <HI>Berticheres,</HI> one of the Deputies for the lower <HI>Languedoc,</HI> a Gentleman of quality, and of good parts, who in the raign of the late King, who was di&s;plea&s;ed at him, by rea&s;on of his practices, and intelligence with the Con&s;ta|ble <HI>Montmorency</HI> Governour of that Province, was &s;omewhat un|hand&s;omely turn'd out of his governments of <HI>Sommieres,</HI> and <HI>Ai|guemortes;</HI> to which having in vaine &s;ought to be re&s;tored, he conceived this a favourable opportunity to make the A&s;&s;embly em|brace his cau&s;e, for that they were both places of &s;ecurity; and, though they were in the hands of Gentlemen of the &s;ame Religion, yet he pre&s;umed they were per&s;ons, that had not given &s;o great Te|&s;timonies of their zeale for the good of the Churches, as he had done; and that though he had been con&s;trained to accept of a re|compence for his Command, yet was it only for that of <HI>Sommiers;</HI> but for <HI>Aignemortes</HI> he never received any thing; and that &s;ince his &s;ervices to their party had drawn upon him this prejudice, it was but rea&s;on that they &s;hould own the Ju&s;tice of his Cau&s;e: And fora&s;much as he had brought with him Writings to verifie what he alledged, he moved the A&s;&s;embly to appoint Commi&s;&s;io|ners to examine them, and make their report to them, that they might con&s;ider of them.</P>
<P>It is to be ob&s;erved that this <HI>Berticheres</HI> made a great profe&s;|&s;ion of friend&s;hip to the Duke of <HI>Sully,</HI> who had done him many good Offices to the late King, &s;o that he de&s;ired &s;ome of his chief|e&s;t friends for Commi&s;&s;ioners, who made &s;o favourable a report of his bu&s;ine&s;s to the A&s;&s;embly, that in &s;pight of the oppo&s;ition made by the Duke of <HI>Bo&uuml;illon,</HI> who &s;tood for <HI>Arembures,</HI> to whom
<PB N="10" REF="10">
the Government of <HI>Aiguemortes</HI> was given, it was &s;o well received by the A&s;&s;embly, that the Deputies re&s;iding at the Court, were commanded to u&s;e all diligence in his behalf, it being a thing of general concernment, and of great con&s;equence. When he had obtained this, he goes to the Court, where he &s;teers a new cour&s;e, and to arrive at his aimes, promi&s;es mo&s;t powerfully to a&s;&s;i&s;t the Court-party, upheld by the Duke of <HI>Bo&uuml;illon,</HI> in the A&s;&s;embly, and by this means got a quick and &s;atisfactory di&s;patch for his re-entry into <HI>Aiguemortes:</HI> Moreover in this journey he made the Con&s;ta|ble his friend, who embraced his cau&s;e with the &s;ame fervour, as if it had been his own proper concernment, and then returned to the A&s;&s;embly: The i&s;&s;ue of this affair &s;hall be &s;een in its proper place: But let us now return to the general affairs.</P>
<P>When the Deputies of the A&s;&s;embly were come to the Court, their fir&s;t di&s;patch thence brought news of their fair reception, e|&s;pecially by the Queen, (who commanded them to put their pa|pers into the hands of <HI>Boi&s;&s;i&s;e,</HI> and <HI>Bullion,</HI> Coun&s;ellors of State) and of the favourable an&s;wers they had at &s;everal audiences recei|ved from the Council: But this was &s;oon clouded by another me&s;&s;age from them quite contrary to the former, which informed the A&s;&s;embly, that the promi&s;e to have their Propo&s;itions an&s;wer|ed, and returned into their hands, was now interpreted to be after the nomination of the Deputies general, and di&s;&s;olution of the A&s;&s;embly: This highly di&s;plea&s;ed them who had already divul|ged among the Provinces, the good hopes they conceived from the fir&s;t intelligence the Deputies gave them: But, fora&s;much as it was a thing contrary to the u&s;e and cu&s;tome of the Kings Council, in affaires of all &s;orts to &s;end back the Deputies unan&s;wered; and that in all their di&s;cour&s;es with them there was no mention of any &s;uch conditions, the A&s;&s;embly unanimou&s;ly re&s;olve not to di&s;&s;olve before they had received an an&s;wer to their Articles; which the Mar&s;hal <HI>Bo&uuml;illon</HI> &s;eem'd to approve of, and promi&s;ed his ut|mo&s;t a&s;&s;i&s;tance to procure them a hand&s;ome returne concern|ing it.</P>
<P>But there was a great difference between the Letter, he &s;hewed the A&s;&s;embly, and that which he &s;ent away, which intimated his opinion, that at lea&s;t &s;ome of them &s;hould &s;ee the an&s;wers to their Propo&s;itions before their di&s;&s;olution: But the a&s;&s;iduous endeavors of the Deputies proving ineffectual, they returned to <HI>Saumure,</HI> where <HI>Ferrier</HI> in the name of all the re&s;t, made a relation of the particulars of their whole voyage, by which they perceived that <HI>Bullion</HI> was coming after with their Propo&s;itions an&s;wered; but that before his arrival their Maje&s;ties de&s;ired the Deputies general might be nominated; which notwith&s;tanding was &s;u&s;pended.</P>
<PB N="11" REF="10">
<P>When <HI>Bullion</HI> came, he confirmed what the Deputies had re|ported, prote&s;ted to many upon his damnation, that the Propo&s;itions were mo&s;t favourably an&s;wered; terrifies &s;ome with threats, whiles he fills others with hopes; and to encrea&s;e both their feares, and hopes, he &s;hews the Patents he brought with him for the augmen|ting the pen&s;ions of <HI>Parabere,</HI> and others, and the Orders to can|cel tho&s;e of the Dukes of <HI>Rohan</HI> and <HI>Soubize.</HI> The Mar&s;hal <HI>Bo&ucirc;il|lon</HI> for his part, employes all his Art to winne the Deputies of the A&s;&s;embly by hopes of a general deputation, and by the power he had to di&s;po&s;e of the Tax impo&s;ed upon the common people now rai&s;ed to an hundred thou&s;and Livers more, the better to enable him to corrupt more men: The re&s;olution al&s;o of the A&s;&s;embly to &s;end new petitions to their Maje&s;ties, that they might receive their an&s;wers before they di&s;&s;olved, gave him an opportunity to play the notable Polititian: For though there was a very good under&s;tanding between the Mar&s;hal <HI>Bo&uuml;illon</HI> and <HI>Bullion,</HI> yet pre|tended they a difference in their opinions; the one a&s;&s;uring them, that it would be but lo&s;t labour to importune the Court any more; the other encouraging them to it with promi&s;es of good &s;ucce&s;&s;e; but his chief de&s;ign was to weary &s;ome with delayes, that he might have the better opportunity to draw others to his party; and in the mean time covered all his projects with a pretence of zeale, that the &s;impler &s;ort having le&s;s &s;u&s;picion of him, might the more ea&s;ily be intrapped: But failing in this attempt, he re&s;olved with <HI>Bullion</HI> and his friends, to per&s;wade their Maje&s;ties to write a let|ter (of which he &s;ent them a draught) peremptorily comman|ding the A&s;&s;embly to di&s;&s;olve, revoking the Licence granted for their meeting, and declaring null all their pa&s;t or future Acts: And fora&s;much as their Maje&s;ties were informed, that all the De|puties did not agree in this ob&s;tinacy and di&s;obedience, they com|manded tho&s;e Deputies that would obey to proceed among them|&s;elves to the election of &s;ix Deputies, who &s;hould receive from the hands of <HI>Bullion</HI> the propo&s;itions with their an&s;wers; which Let|ter was to be brought by one, that knew well enough how to play his Game. <HI>Bellugeon</HI> the Mar&s;hal <HI>Le&s;diguieres</HI> his Agent, was made choice of for this employment, a fit In&s;trument to execute &s;uch a Commi&s;&s;ion, being a crafty fellow, void both of honor and hone&s;ty, who&s;e &s;ubtle pate was alwayes bu&s;ied about things condu|cing only to his own advantage.</P>
<P>Before he began this goodly journey, he takes his leave of the A&s;&s;embly, fal&s;ly pretending, it was only to &s;ee his friends and kinred in <HI>Berry,</HI> and then goes out of the Town upon an ordina|ry Hackny, but &s;oon after takes po&s;t: which being certified to the A&s;&s;embly, as al&s;o his treacherous practices at <HI>Paris,</HI> together

with the calumnies he a&s;per&s;ed the Duke of <HI>Rohan,</HI> and his friends withal, he was by them declared unworthy to be re-admitted to this, and for the future to any other A&s;&s;embly: But fora&s;much as he had the honour of being a &s;ervant to the Mar&s;hal <HI>Le&s;digui|eres,</HI> they referred his futher doom to him. This cen&s;ure infi|nitely vexed the Mar&s;hal <HI>Bo&uuml;illon,</HI> who employed all the power he had to get it revoked, declaring that it was by his command that he had undertaken this journey, but all in vain; which &s;o in|cen&s;ed him again&s;t the Duke of <HI>Rohan,</HI> that they forbore to &s;peak one to the other for a long time after.</P>
<P>It was not long before the effects of this voyage were &s;een; for the Letter for their di&s;&s;olution contrived at <HI>Saumure,</HI> but di|&s;patched from the Court, came, and &s;oon after <HI>Bellugeon,</HI> who de|clared that they &s;hould now receive full &s;atisfaction: But when the Mar&s;hal <HI>Bo&uuml;illon</HI> went up to the Ca&s;tle, and &s;hewed the Let|ter to <HI>Du Ple&s;&s;is,</HI> and <HI>La Force,</HI> endeavouring to gain their appro|bation of it, and the contents of it were fully under&s;tood by them, then were they filled with amazement and di&s;plea&s;ure; which <HI>Bo&uuml;illon</HI> perceiving, he thought it convenient that <HI>Du Ple&s;&s;is</HI> &s;hould impart the &s;ub&s;tance of it, to &s;uch of the A&s;&s;embly as he thought fit, that together they might contrive &s;ome means to compo&s;e all differences. <HI>Bullion</HI> al&s;o promi&s;es to deferre the delivery of the Letter, out of a &s;eeming de&s;ire to &s;eek out &s;ome way for an acco|modation; and to that end de&s;ires a conference with <HI>Du Ple&s;&s;is,</HI> which being yielded unto, after &s;ome di&s;cour&s;e, they agreed that in ca&s;e they &s;hould proceed to a nomination of &s;ix Deputies, and re&s;t &s;atisfied with the an&s;wers were given them, he (although he had no Commi&s;&s;ion for it) &s;hould undertake to procure them &s;ati&s;|faction from their Maje&s;ties upon the foure or five principal Arti|cles, as, concerning the Chamber of Edicts at <HI>Paris,</HI> Provi&s;ion for Vacant places, the payment of the remaining part of Nine &s;core thou&s;and Crowns, and the re&s;toring of tho&s;e places of &s;ecu|rity were taken from us; and all this to be done before the di&s;&s;olu|tion of the A&s;&s;embly; to which as <HI>Du Ple&s;&s;is</HI> was ready to make his report of this conference, <HI>Bullion</HI> &s;ent him word, that he was in|formed, and that by very good intelligence, that there were &s;ome, who intended to take advantage of his di&s;cour&s;es the day before; wherefore he retracted them, and de&s;ired he might be permit|ted to go into the A&s;&s;embly to have the <HI>Queenes</HI> Letter read, and di&s;charge his duty to the Commands he had received from Her.</P>
<P>This &s;udden change clearly di&s;covered, that the end of this con|ference was only to amu&s;e the hone&s;t party in the A&s;&s;embly, the better to &s;urprize them before any thing was agreed on, or that

they were prepared for what they were to do, either in order to their di&s;&s;olution, or the Deputation, and cheat them of the thanks and benefit of their pains: But both <HI>Bo&uuml;illon</HI> and <HI>Bullion</HI> too, were not a little di&s;mayed when they &s;aw, that when upon the reading of the Letter <HI>Berticheres</HI> ro&s;e up, and &s;aid, That for his part, he would obey, and that it was fit that tho&s;e that were of his opinion &s;hould likewi&s;e declare them&s;elves; all of them with one voice cryed out, that they were more re&s;olved upon obedience than he, but that the bu&s;ine&s;&s;e &s;hould be further di&s;cu&s;&s;ed, when the Commi&s;&s;ioner was withdrawn, which was accordingly done.</P>
<P>But here it is to be ob&s;erved, that notice being taken of the con|&s;ultations which were commonly held night and day in the Mar|&s;hal <HI>Bo&uuml;illon's</HI> Lodgings, by five and twenty of the A&s;&s;embly (which were all he could draw to a confederacy with him) where <HI>Bullion</HI> al&s;o was often pre&s;ent, the re&s;t of the A&s;&s;embly, to the number of fifty, with one con&s;ent conceived it fitter to yield to the nece&s;&s;ity of the times, than to make a divi&s;ion, which would inevitably force them to accept for Deputies general, per&s;ons whol|ly devoted to the Court faction, and that they were better &s;eek out &s;ome other way to redre&s;s their evils.</P>
<P>The Mar&s;hal <HI>Bo&uuml;illon</HI> perceiving that the re&s;olutions taken up by his <HI>Antagonists,</HI> had fru&s;trated his hopes of procuring &s;ome creatures of his own to be cho&s;en Deputies general, makes his applications by <HI>Proxy,</HI> to the Duke of <HI>Rohan,</HI> for his con&s;ent to the re&s;toring againe of <HI>Bellugeon,</HI> and &s;haring the Deputation ge|neral between them two: In which the Duke of <HI>Sully</HI> al&s;o intere&s;|&s;ed him&s;elf, and &s;o farre prevailed with the Duke of <HI>Rohan,</HI> that he cau&s;ed an interview between them at his Lodgings, where the Mar&s;hal entreated him to abate his rigour towards <HI>Bellugeon,</HI> which he promi&s;ed him to do: But as for &s;haring the Deputation, he was &s;o aver&s;e from the very mention of it, that at the meeting on the day appointed for their election, the Duke of <HI>Sully</HI> openly blamed him for his ob&s;tinacy, telling him that he would ruine all by his wilfulne&s;s: But the i&s;&s;ue di&s;covered the contrary: For ha|ving a&s;&s;ured him&s;elf of ten Provinces, he makes them agree to e|lect the &s;ix Deputies that &s;hould be nominated by the Mini&s;ters of tho&s;e provinces; which &s;ucceeded according as he had de&s;igned it; for not one of tho&s;e the Mar&s;hal would have promoted (to his extream di&s;content) were &s;o much as named.

<P>And hence &s;prang the Original of all our mi&s;chiefs and divi&s;i|ons; For the Mar&s;hal takes his journey to the Court, to receive a recompence for his &s;ervices, and revenge him&s;elf upon all tho&s;e that had oppo&s;ed his de&s;igns, principally the Duke of <HI>Rohan,</HI> who feared him lea&s;t, and had with&s;tood him mo&s;t of any; wherefore he layes a plot to out him of his Town of <HI>Saint John d' Angely,</HI> of which he was Governour, and place therein <HI>La Roche-beaucourt</HI> the King's Lieutenant in his roome, alledging, that if he were once deprived of that retreat, he would be unable to attempt any thing: On the other &s;ide, the Duke of <HI>Rohan,</HI> and his brother, at a Con|&s;ultation held at <HI>Saumure</HI> before their departure thence, with tho&s;e that were of their opinion, concluded that every one of them &s;hould give their re&s;pective Provinces an account of what had pa&s;&s;ed, and in&s;tigate them by particular Deputies to the Court, to make new Remon&s;trances of their aggrievances, which they &s;o happily per|formed, that in &s;pight of the contradictions of the Commi&s;&s;ioners appointed for the execution of the Edict, the years following there came to <HI>Paris</HI> Deputies from twelve Provinces.</P>
<P>In the mean while the Duke of <HI>Rohan</HI> goes to divert him&s;elf at his hou&s;es in <HI>Britany,</HI> and &s;o to the A&s;&s;embly of E&s;tates of that Province; At his return from thence he was informed of the con|&s;piracies laid at <HI>Saint Johns</HI> in prejudice of his authority; to di|&s;cover which, and al&s;o to apply convenient preventions, he &s;ends thither <HI>Haulte Fontaine,</HI> from whom receiving advice of the nece&s;&s;ity of his pre&s;ence, he ha&s;ts thither with all &s;peed, and as he pa&s;&s;ed through <HI>Poictou,</HI> gave his friends intelligence of all, and &s;ent <HI>Lou|driere</HI> to <HI>Rochel.</HI></P>
<P>His unexpected arrival much daunted his enemies, who never|thele&s;&s;e &s;ent for <HI>Roch-beaucourt</HI> to come &s;peedily to their relief; but the Duke of <HI>Rohan</HI>'s friends, flocking in every moment, grew to &s;uch a number, as that <HI>Roche-beaucourt</HI> dur&s;t not &s;tir, but conten|ted him&s;elf with giving the Court an account of what pa&s;&s;ed: Upon which information the King di&s;patches away <HI>La Fontaine</HI> to the Duke, in appearance to know what was the matter, but in ef|fect to confirm by letters, and encourage the <HI>Parti&s;ans</HI> of <HI>Roche|beaucourt,</HI> which the Duke, having treated him nobly, learnt out of <HI>La Fontaine,</HI> whom he returned with a faithful promi&s;e to wait upon their Maje&s;ties, with a free account of all his actions, upon their fir&s;t commands, which within a few dayes after he received;

And pre&s;ently &s;ets forward to the Court, taking with him, among others, <HI>Roche-beaucourt,</HI> and <HI>Faucault,</HI> whom he greatly &s;u&s;pected; and leaving in Saint <HI>John Haulte Fontaine</HI> with all nece&s;&s;ary Or|ders and In&s;tructions, that at his return, he might not finde his own gates &s;hut again&s;t him. Being arrived at Court, he &s;hewed the Queen by &s;everal in&s;tances, that he had behaved him&s;elf like an hone&s;t man at the A&s;&s;embly of <HI>Saumure,</HI> and that he had oppo&s;ed the Mar&s;hal <HI>Bo&uuml;illon,</HI> for that he knew, that he took part with tho&s;e of the Reformed Religion, for no other end, but to advance his own Intere&s;ts, and render him&s;elf more con&s;iderable both of the one &s;ide, and the other, and that had he compa&s;&s;ed his de&s;ignes, &s;he would have been the fir&s;t would have felt the effects of his ar|rogance: But there were no eares open to his ju&s;tification, (it being the con&s;tant humour of Princes not ea&s;ily to be rea&s;oned out of opinions, they have been prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed withal) &s;o that &s;eeing the time for the Election of a new Major for the Town of <HI>Saint John</HI> drew near, and that his abode at Court was to no purpo&s;e, he pretended that his brother was &s;ick, upon which having got leave to be gone, he took po&s;t that very night; which fell out well for him; For the Mar&s;hal <HI>Bo&uuml;illon</HI> having notice the next day of his departure, was very earne&s;t to have him pur&s;ued, and brought back again; but he made &s;uch ha&s;te, as it was impo&s;&s;ible to over|take him.</P>
<P>As he pa&s;&s;ed by <HI>Parc</HI> in the lower <HI>Poictou,</HI> he took <HI>Soubize</HI> a|long with him, adverti&s;ed his friends in <HI>Poictou</HI> of what had hap|pened, and went to <HI>Saint John,</HI> whither <HI>Foucault,</HI> a Captain of the Garri&s;on, whom he had taken with him to <HI>Paris,</HI> being &s;ent away from the Court, was come before him, and had &s;ecretly a&s;|&s;embled the Major and &s;ome others of that <HI>Cabal,</HI> to out the Duke of the Government, and for that end offered them two thou|&s;and men; which the Duke having notice of, pre&s;ently upon his arrival at <HI>Saint John,</HI> he commanded <HI>Foucault,</HI> who was then a|bout three or four leagues thence, to return thither no more, and at the &s;ame in&s;tant &s;ent away <HI>Tenis</HI> to their Maje&s;ties, to informe them of the ju&s;t cau&s;e he had, not to allow the &s;aid <HI>Foucault</HI> any more acce&s;&s;e to <HI>Saint John.</HI></P>
<P>The time for the Election of the Major being at hand, which is alwayes the Sunday before <HI>Palme Sunday,</HI> comes <HI>Claverie</HI> from the Court with an expre&s;s, which &s;ignified, that by rea&s;on of the divi|&s;ions of the Town, it was the Kings plea&s;ure, for the repo&s;e of it, and the avoiding of factions there, that the old Major &s;hould be con|tinued, and that this precedent &s;hould not for the future any way impair the Priviledges of the Town; whereupon the Duke of <HI>Ro|han</HI> remon&s;trates to his Maje&s;ty, how that he was mi&s;-informed of
<PB N="16" REF="13">
the condition of the Town, and of what con&s;equence it was, both to his &s;ervice, and the publick peace, that, according to their an|cient cu&s;tome, they &s;hould proceed to Election of a new Major, hoping that this would be a&s;&s;ented to, and for that rea&s;on &s;ent his Secretary with this letter to the Court.</P>
<P>Now the Mar&s;hall <HI>Bo&uuml;illon</HI> rightly imagining, that the Duke of <HI>Rohan</HI> would oppo&s;e the continuation of the old Major, as a thing highly prejudicial to him, engaged the Royal authority in it to the uttermo&s;t, that &s;o he might either ruine him by his voluntary &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, or by obliging the King to force him to a complyance; So that two dayes after the arrival of <HI>Claverie</HI> comes <HI>Saint More,</HI> a younger brother of <HI>Montauzier,</HI> and brother in law to <HI>Roch-beau|court</HI> with another, and &s;tricter expre&s;&s;e to the &s;ame purpo&s;e: But the Duke of <HI>Rohan</HI> knowing, that his own ruine would a&s;&s;uredly be the con&s;equence of the lo&s;&s;e of <HI>Saint John,</HI> conceived it lea&s;t dangerous for him to &s;ecure the Town, and feared not to re|fu&s;e all tho&s;e Orders as prejudicial to the King's &s;ervice, and to proceed to the Election of a new Major, according to the u&s;ual cu&s;tome of the Town, out of three of the Corporation, who&s;e names were &s;ent by Deputies, con&s;tituted for that purpo&s;e, to his Maje&s;ty, to make choice of which of them he plea&s;ed; and for the &s;ecurity of the place, the Keys were, in the interim, put into the hands of the fir&s;t Alderman.</P>
<P>The report of the&s;e things cau&s;ed a great bu&s;tle at Court; <HI>Tenis,</HI> and <HI>Onglepied,</HI> whom the Duke &s;ome few dayes before, had &s;ent thither, were committed pri&s;oners to the <HI>Ba&s;tille;</HI> his mother, wife, and &s;i&s;ters were forbid to go out of <HI>Paris;</HI> and Propo&s;itions were al&s;o made of drawing down an Army to be&s;iege him; On the other&s;ide the Duke, well knowing the power of his enemies at Court, and that he was to expect a violent per&s;ecution from them, took great care to make all tho&s;e of the Reformed Religion in <HI>France</HI> &s;en&s;ible; that the hatred conceived again&s;t him, was occa|&s;ioned only by the re&s;olution and con&s;tancy he had &s;hewed to the good of their affairs; that his, and the lo&s;&s;e of <HI>St. John,</HI> would draw after them their de&s;truction al&s;o; that if their adver&s;aries found this ea&s;ily accompli&s;hable, they would not &s;top their cour&s;e in &s;o fair a roade; and then prepares him&s;elf the be&s;t he could to make a brave re&s;i&s;tance. But at length when all things were more ma|turely deliberated, the King's Council thought fitter to commit this bu&s;ine&s;&s;e to a Treaty, and <HI>Themines</HI> was &s;ent to the Duke to determinate the difference in a peaceable way: The re&s;ult of his negotiation was, That, for eight dayes the Keyes of the Town &s;hould be left in the hands of the old Major, that they &s;hould pro|ceed to the nomination of three, out of which the King &s;hould
<PB N="17" REF="13">
make choice of one; and, that after this Election <HI>Roche-beaucourt</HI> and <HI>Foucault</HI> &s;hould be permitted to return again to execute their charges, provided, notwith&s;tanding that the latter &s;hould pre&s;ently quit the Town again.</P>
<P><HI>Themines</HI> &s;ent this agreement to the Court, where at fir&s;t it was well enough liked of; but when it was communicated to, and &s;can|ned by the Dukes enemies, it could by no means be approved of: But <HI>Themines</HI> had orders &s;ent him, to in&s;i&s;t upon the return of <HI>Roche-beaucourt</HI> and <HI>Foucault,</HI> before the new Election, which the Duke of <HI>Rohan</HI> con&s;ented to; and thus, for the pre&s;ent, was miti|gated the heat of this affair, though the per&s;ecutions again&s;t the Duke of <HI>Rohan</HI> and his party continued in their former violence; e&s;pecially at Court, where the Mar&s;hal <HI>Bo&uuml;illon</HI> endeavoured, fir&s;t to corrupt the Deputies, then to make divi&s;ions among them; and la&s;t of all to de&s;troy their authority: And when the Provinces &s;ent their Deputies to the Court to remon&s;trate their re&s;entments of the ill impre&s;&s;ions were given their Maje&s;ties of their loyalty, to vindicate them&s;elves from the calumnies vented again&s;t them, and to obtain a grant of all their ju&s;t demands, &s;o nece&s;&s;ary to their &s;ub&s;i&s;tance: The Mar&s;hal <HI>Bo&uuml;illon</HI> perceiving, that neither his confederacies in the Provinces, nor the Commi&s;&s;ioners pur|po&s;ely &s;ent in to them, could hinder the deputations, turns now his whole endeavours to render their Negotiation fruitle&s;&s;e, al|ledging, that it was a diminution of the Kings authority to give audience to an A&s;&s;embly convened again&s;t his will; that, if their reque&s;ts were yeilded to, and &s;atisfaction given them that way, it would di&s;gu&s;t the loyal part of his &s;ubjects, and reunite the now disjoyned Provinces with the Complainants; and openly di&s;co|vering al&s;o great di&s;plea&s;ure, that they &s;hould repay all his &s;ervi|ces with &s;lights, and envie; imputing unto him, upon all occa&s;ions, what ever mi&s;chief befel them: So that, though he could not pre|vent their audience, he fru&s;trated the contentment they hoped thence, telling the Deputies general freely, that what he did, was in tevenge of the affronts he received from the A&s;&s;embly at <HI>Saumure.</HI></P>
<P>The&s;e things pa&s;&s;ing thus, the Mar&s;hal <HI>Bo&uuml;illon</HI> continues his ill offices to the intere&s;ts of tho&s;e of the Reformed Religion in ge|neral, and tho&s;e of the Duke of <HI>Rohan</HI> in particular; and having obtain'd the Amba&s;&s;ador&s;hip extraordinary for <HI>England</HI> to get the alliance with <HI>Spaine</HI> approved of there, feeds him&s;elf al&s;o with hopes by the means of that imployment, there to procure a di&s;like of the actions of the A&s;&s;embly of <HI>Saumure:</HI> But the Duke of <HI>Rohan</HI> found an opportunity, by a Gentleman that attended on the Mar&s;hal in the voyage, to give the King of <HI>England</HI> a true information of all things; &s;o that as to that particular, the an&s;wer
<PB N="18" REF="14">
he received, was, that if the Queen &s;hould be induced to infringe the Edicts made in favour of tho&s;e of the Reformed Religion, &s;o that it were manife&s;t, that they were per&s;ecuted for their Religions &s;ake; his Maje&s;ty required, in that ca&s;e, that neither the League lately made with <HI>France,</HI> nor his pre&s;ent confirmation of the &s;ame, &s;hould be under&s;tood to their prejudice: For Nature teaches eve|ry one, when he &s;ees his neighbour a&s;&s;aulted for a quarrel which re|lates to him&s;elf, to fore&s;ee what he may expect from the i&s;&s;ue of it. As for his part, the King of <HI>England</HI> exhorted the Mar&s;hal to a re|conciliation with the Duke of <HI>Rohan,</HI> to whom al&s;o he intimated his plea&s;ure in that particular: In reference to which, the Nati|onal Synod then held at <HI>Priuas,</HI> endeavoured it al&s;o, and for that end, be&s;ides the Deputies general, cho&s;e <HI>Du Moulin,</HI> and <HI>Durand,</HI> Mini&s;ters, and <HI>L' i&s;le-gro lot</HI> an Elder, who&s;e care and pains in it were &s;o effectual, that the &s;ixteenth of <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> in the year 1612. the Mar&s;hals <HI>Bo&uuml;illon,</HI> and <HI>Le&s;deguieres</HI> &s;igned the&s;e en&s;uing Articles, viz. <HI>That they would hearken to a &s;incere reunion, promi&s;ing to &s;ubmit their own particular intere&s;ts to the common welfare of tho&s;e of the Reformed Religion, by an Oblivion of all past in|juries: That they would freely renounce all re&s;entments, and ani|mo&s;ities again&s;t any per&s;ons, and for what cau&s;e &s;oever: That they would love and honour every one according to his ranke and quality, giving them upon all occa&s;ions, all testimonies of friend|&s;hip, as far as the duty of true Chri&s;tians, and faithful Subjects of the King &s;hould oblige and permit them.</HI> They farther al&s;o prote&s;ted, <HI>that they de&s;ired nothing more, than by a firm Union and concord to &s;ee the Kingdom of God advanced, and the Churches flouri&s;h in a happy peace, under the obedience of his Maje&s;ty; and, moreover, to imploy all their power, that the authority of the Synods be not invalidated, nor the Di&s;cipline infringed; and that they would not favour, nor any wayes a&s;|&s;i&s;t any particular per&s;ons or Churches, that by unju&s;t or preju|dicial means &s;hould &s;eparate from the Union, and conformity to the Doctrine and Di&s;cipline received in the Churches.</HI> This Pro|te&s;tation was al&s;o &s;igned by the Dukes of <HI>Rohan, Sully,</HI> and <HI>Sou|bize, La Force,</HI> and <HI>Du Ple&s;&s;is;</HI> to which they de&s;ired might be ad|ded the&s;e following Articles; <HI>viz. To cau&s;e this Act to be &s;igned by the Governours of all places of &s;ecurity, and other per&s;ons of con&s;ideration in the Provinces, and that by the way of Con&s;e|rence; and, that a Clau&s;e might be in&s;erted, by which they &s;hould oblige them&s;elves to ob&s;erve, as well all Politique, as Eccle&s;iasti|cal order, and to re&s;tore and confirm the authority of the Deputies general in their charges.</HI></P>
<P>But for all the&s;e goodly appearances, the per&s;ecutions again&s;t
<PB N="19" REF="14">
tho&s;e of the Religion, and the Duke of <HI>Rohan,</HI> cea&s;ed not; which enforced them at la&s;t, upon the grievances of the Province of <HI>Xaintonge</HI> to call an A&s;&s;embly of five Provinces, according to the regulation of the A&s;&s;embly of <HI>Saumure.</HI></P>
<P>Whiles the&s;e things were a doing, there hapned a new accident, which ha&s;tned the A&s;&s;embly: <HI>Berticheres,</HI> &s;upported with the power of the Con&s;table, the Decree of the A&s;&s;embly of <HI>Saumure,</HI> and the fa|vor of the Court, would needs repo&s;&s;e&s;&s;e his government of <HI>Aigue|mortes:</HI> But the Province, adverti&s;ed of his demeanour by <HI>Saugeon</HI> (whom the Duke had &s;ent thither purpo&s;ely with a character of him) &s;o ordered that affair, that, in &s;pight of the Con&s;table, they main|tained <HI>Arembures</HI> in it, and kept <HI>Berticheres</HI> out; which &s;o incen|&s;ed him, that he made <HI>Saugeon</HI> a pri&s;oner at <HI>Ville-franck</HI> in <HI>Ro&uuml;|ergue,</HI> which was more than he could do in his own government. When the Duke of <HI>Rohan,</HI> and the Province of <HI>Xaintonge</HI> heard this, they avowed the voyage, and owned the cau&s;e of <HI>Sangeon:</HI> The A&s;&s;embly al&s;o met at <HI>Rochel,</HI> notwith&s;tanding the ill u&s;age, and traver&s;es occa&s;ioned them by the Mar&s;hal <HI>Bo&uuml;illon,</HI> who &s;how|ed him&s;elf more their enemy, than all the Kings Council be&s;ide (notwith&s;tanding his engagement pa&s;&s;ed to the King of <HI>England,</HI> and the Deputies of the National Synod) and in&s;tigated the Cler|gy of <HI>France</HI> to go to the <HI>Quetn,</HI> and hinder her giving any fa|vourable an&s;wers to tho&s;e of the Religion, &s;uppo&s;ing that &s;uch ri|gor would force them upon extremities, &amp; would make them appear guilty of a de&s;ire of war, and give him an occa&s;ion to interpo&s;e as a mediator for them at Court; that &s;o, he might render him&s;elf u&s;eful to both parties, and whatever happened, &s;till make up his own reckoning.</P>
<P>On the other &s;ide, <HI>Du Ple&s;&s;is</HI> tired with the&s;e per&s;ecutions, from which he him&s;elf was not exempted, and fearing what the i&s;&s;ue of the&s;e di&s;turbances would be, interpo&s;es for the compo&s;ing of them, and comes to <HI>Rochel</HI> accompanied with <HI>Rouvray,</HI> one of the Depu|ties general, and brother to his &s;on in law, bringing with him a draught of &s;ome Articles, not &s;igned: But the &s;ucce&s;&s;e of his ne|gotiation, not an&s;wering his expectation, he withdrew again, and with him, the Province of <HI>Anjou,</HI> (one of the five a&s;&s;embled) Ne|verthele&s;&s;e, the other four continued well united, and by Me&s;&s;en|gers, de&s;ired the Duke of <HI>Rohan</HI>'s pre&s;ence at <HI>Rochel,</HI> to con&s;ult with them about what was to be done: When he came, it was re|&s;olved, that they &s;hould &s;end a Gentleman to the <HI>Queen,</HI> in the name of the Provinces, to accept, for the pre&s;ent, the offers had been made them, referring the pur&s;uance of the re&s;t to the Depu|ties general.

The Mar&s;hal <HI>d' Ancre,</HI> who had ingro&s;&s;ed the whole favour of the Queen, bred, and cheri&s;hed divi&s;ions among the great ones, le&s;t their union &s;hould ob&s;truct his advancement; &s;o equally ballancing all parties, that neither could over-poi&s;e the other, and continually fomenting envie and jealou|&s;ies among them, le&s;t their reconciliation &s;hould prove his ruine: They on the other &s;ide &s;uffering them&s;elves to be hurried on by the violence of pa&s;&s;ion, rather than led by the calmer conduct of rea&s;on, &s;o that all the Princes of the blood were &s;een in op|po&s;ition one again&s;t the other, and tho&s;e al&s;o of the hou&s;e of <HI>Lorraine,</HI> according as their pre&s;ent enjoyments, or hopes of future favour moved them: But at length the Prince of <HI>Conde</HI> upon the Queens refu&s;al to give him <HI>Cha&s;teau Trompette,</HI> rai&s;ed a party of di&s;|contents, under pretence of reforming the di&s;orders in the govern|ment of the State; The Mar&s;hal <HI>Bo&uuml;illon</HI> the main contriver of this Party, managed it with &s;uch artifice, that he cau&s;ed the Prince, the Dukes of <HI>Longueville, Nevers, Maine,</HI> and others, to ab&s;ent them&s;elves from the Court, whom he him&s;elf followed the la&s;t of all, and with the Queens con&s;ent too, upon the hopes he had given

her of reducing all tho&s;e Princes; And with &s;uch dexterity hand died he the affair, that he became both the Author and compo&s;er of it; in which there was one very remarkable thing to be taken notice of, which was, that he imparted the whole bu&s;ine&s;&s;e to the knowledge of the Duke of <HI>Rohan</HI>'s mo&s;t faithful friends, and con|cealed it from his own, whom in other things he had alwayes tru|&s;ted; for that he very well knew the corruption and fal&s;hood of the one, and the integrity and fidelity of the other.</P>
<P>The Prince with his Parti&s;ans retired to <HI>Mezieres,</HI> a Town be|longing to the Duke of <HI>Nevers,</HI> near <HI>Sedan;</HI> The Duke of <HI>Maine</HI> who was Governour of the I&s;le of <HI>France,</HI> with the Towns of <HI>Soi&s;|&s;ons, Noyons,</HI> and the Ca&s;tle of <HI>Pierrefons;</HI> the Marque&s;&s;e <HI>de Ceu|vres</HI> with <HI>Laon;</HI> all very con&s;iderable places, together with the Duke of <HI>Longveville,</HI> Governour of <HI>Picardy,</HI> with all the friends and &s;ervants they could mu&s;ter in their governments joyning to the frontires of <HI>Germany,</HI> and <HI>Flanders,</HI> with the re&s;t of the di&s;|contents in <HI>France,</HI> made up a very formidable party; to which I &s;hall not adde, that upon the retaining of the&s;e Male-contents from the Court, the Duke of <HI>Vendo&s;me</HI> being apprehended in the <HI>Louvre,</HI> and there detained pri&s;oner; a few dayes after made his e&s;cape, and got into <HI>Britany</HI> his own government, where he made great preparations al&s;o.</P>
<P>Things being in this condition, the <HI>Prince</HI> writes a letter to the <HI>Queen,</HI> who&s;e contents were nothing but complaints of the di&s;or|ders committed in the State under her authority; that the Prin|ces of the blood, Dukes, Peers, and Officers of the Crown were excluded from the Publick affairs, which were managed by three or four only, who to maintain their own height, &s;owed divi&s;ions among the Nobility, lavi&s;hing the trea&s;ures, and at their plea|&s;ure, di&s;po&s;ing of them, the Ar&s;inals and Frontire Garri&s;ons, which were intru&s;ted in the hands of &s;trangers, who were in no wi&s;e re|&s;pon&s;ible for them; that they de&s;ired an A&s;&s;embly of the States General, according to the Cu&s;tome, during the Minorities of their Kings, in which the <HI>Queen</HI> &s;hould finde a legal provi&s;ion made for the &s;upport of her authority, the pre&s;ervation of the Lawes, and reforming all abu&s;es that ob&s;tructed the admini&s;tration of them. He writes al&s;o to the Parliament of <HI>Paris,</HI> and all the Grandees not yet confederated with him, to invite them to a Conjunction with his Party; and to the Deputies general al&s;o, telling them that tho&s;e of the Religion were not forgotten in his Remon&s;trances; He &s;ent al&s;o <HI>Le Maretz</HI> Lieutenant of his guards, to the Duke of <HI>Rohan</HI> to court him to arme in his behalf, prote&s;ting that he would not li&s;ten to any agreement, but with his con&s;ent: But the Duke who on the one &s;ide knew very well the credit the Mar&s;hal

<HI>Bo&uuml;illon</HI> had gained among his mo&s;t intimate confidents; and on the other, remembring the continual ill offices he had received from him ever &s;ince the A&s;&s;embly of <HI>Saumure;</HI> and being not un|jealous that the war was only declared in words, whil'&s;t in truth they were already entred into a Treaty, re&s;olved to &s;end <HI>Hault|fontaine,</HI> in whom he repo&s;ed great confidence, along with <HI>Maretz,</HI> to make a di&s;covery of the true po&s;ture of the <HI>Prince</HI> his affairs; and in the interim made his addre&s;&s;es by letter to the Queen, a&s;|&s;uring her, that he would continue united with the whole body of tho&s;e of the Religion, to whom if &s;he plea&s;ed to vouch&s;afe &s;ome &s;atisfaction, &s;he &s;hould reclaime her di&s;contents at an ea&s;ie rate.</P>
<P>In the mean while the <HI>Prince</HI> came to <HI>Saint Menchould,</HI> a &s;trong place within the government of the Duke of <HI>Nevers,</HI> which he had &s;ecured; and there al&s;o arrived <HI>Hault-fontaine,</HI> where, in|&s;tead of a war proclaimed, he found a Treaty well advanced; He was received with much honour, and admitted al&s;o to their Coun|&s;els; Upon his arrival, it was given out, that he came with an offer of eight thou&s;and foot, and two thou&s;and hor&s;e from his Ma&s;ter, on purpo&s;e to ha&s;ten the Treaty, and yet was he &s;ent back to the Duke with an a&s;&s;urance that there &s;hould be none, and a reque&s;t to rai&s;e armes: But <HI>Hault-fontaine</HI> a&s;&s;ured him that the Peace was concluded, and that <HI>Amboi&s;e</HI> was to be given to the Prince, <HI>Menchould</HI> to the Duke of <HI>Nevers,</HI> and a round &s;umme of money to the Duke of <HI>Bo&uuml;illon,</HI> and that an A&s;&s;embly of the States general was promi&s;ed; which in a &s;hort time after was performed: And thus did their own private intere&s;ts intercept their regard to the con&s;ideration of the publick.</P>
<P>The Duke of <HI>Vendo&s;me,</HI> who, after his e&s;cape, had levied ma|ny men in <HI>Britany,</HI> and engaged him&s;elf in the fortification of <HI>Blavet,</HI> was much troubled to &s;ee him&s;elf thus forlorne: He &s;ent <HI>Roche Giffar</HI> to the Duke of <HI>Rohan,</HI> with earne&s;t per&s;wa&s;ions to joyne with him, which were well mixed with faire promi&s;es in fa|vour of tho&s;e of the Religion: But all could extract no other an|&s;wer from him, than that the be&s;t coun&s;el could be given him, was to dige&s;t, as well as he could, his dereliction, and in time, to com|ply, le&s;t his ob&s;tinacy &s;hould draw upon him an inevitable ruine. But this advice had no operations upon his re&s;olutions; though the Prince, when he came into <HI>Poictou,</HI> added his per&s;wa&s;ions too, and endeavours to approve of his precipitation of the peace: The Prince was al&s;o very &s;erious to &s;ee the Duke of <HI>Rohan,</HI> who to &s;a|tisfie him in that particular, came to <HI>La Roche des Aubieres in An|jou,</HI> where he &s;hews him, how he had been forced to &s;huffle up a peace the be&s;t he could, for that the Mar&s;hal <HI>Bo&uuml;illon,</HI> ambitious

of all the thanks and profit, had debauched and &s;educed mo&s;t of his party (&s;peaking well indeed of none but the Duke of <HI>Nevers</HI>) &s;o that he was con&s;trained to accept of <HI>Amboi&s;e;</HI> That he hoped to procure an A&s;&s;embly of the States General, in which his par|ty would be the mo&s;t prevalent, for that every one in their Province, &s;tickled hard for him; and that it was there, the af|fairs of the Kingdom &s;hould have a redre&s;s, and the Nobility enjoy their dignities, or el&s;e that they &s;hould have more forces, and a better pretence for a War; that though he had ca&s;t off many Gentlemen and Souldiers, yet he regarded not that much, for that he knew, <HI>France</HI> was alwayes well &s;tored with di&s;con|tents.</P>
<P>To which was an&s;wered, that the States would rather oppo&s;e his de&s;igns, and in&s;tead of augmenting, le&s;&s;en his authority; for that the fear of evil, and hope of good, the mo&s;t prevalent mo|tives upon the affections of men, were from the <HI>Queen,</HI> not him; and that the rea&s;on, why many refu&s;ed to take Armes, though he commanded them, was, becau&s;e he him&s;elf did not, but had made his peace; for which he was upbraided both by the Duke of <HI>Ro|han,</HI> and his brother; of which he excu&s;ed him&s;elf the be&s;t he could, with many large prote&s;tations of friend&s;hip to them, and a high approbation of the Coun&s;el they had given the Duke of <HI>Ven|do&s;me;</HI> and thus was their interview terminated: After which, the Prince to make his advantage of all, wrote to the Pre&s;ident <HI>Ja|nin,</HI> that he had de&s;ired a meeting from the Duke of <HI>Rohan</HI> for no other end, but to break off the confederacy between the Duke of <HI>Vendo&s;me</HI> and him.</P>
<P>This being pa&s;t, all parties were very indu&s;trious to procure a no|mination of &s;uch Deputies in the Provinces, for the States Gene|ral, to be convened at <HI>Paris</HI> the winter following, as were mo&s;t devoted to them; And in the mean while the <HI>King</HI> and <HI>Queen</HI> took their journey towards <HI>Britany</HI> to reduce the Duke of <HI>Ven|do&s;me:</HI> When they came to <HI>Poictieres, Villeroy</HI> di&s;patches to the Duke of <HI>Rohan</HI> one <HI>Villette</HI> (whom he knew to be a friend of his) to let him know, that their Maje&s;ties pa&s;&s;ing within twenty Leagues of him, would take it ill if he neglected to come and wait upon them, a&s;&s;uring him of a fair reception; and that it was &s;uch an opportunity to &s;et him&s;elf right againe with them, as in prudence he ought not to let &s;lip: Upon this encouragement he went thither, where, after a very good welcome given him, they engaged him to be pre&s;ent at the States of <HI>Britany</HI> to be held at <HI>Nantes,</HI> where all their propo&s;itions were an&s;wered with a free a&s;&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">nt to them, whether they concerned the Deputations for the States General, or the Duke of <HI>Vendo&s;me,</HI> who was for<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ed to

pre&s;ent him&s;elf before them, and wholly &s;ubmit him&s;elf to their plea&s;ures. This done, they returned thence, it being pre&s;ently after the Autumn, to <HI>Paris,</HI> whither a general curio&s;ity carried every one to &s;ee what would be the i&s;&s;ue of the States General. The Prince was in very good intelligence with the &s;tronge&s;t party in the Parliament, occa&s;ioned rather by their hatred to the pre|&s;ent government, than by any influence from his vertue or good conduct; for had his life and actions been in any degree propor|tionable to his pretences, and Remon&s;trances, he would have much di&s;turbed the <HI>Queens</HI> government.</P>
<P>Come we now to the States, who a&s;&s;embled at <HI>Paris</HI> about the latter end of <HI>October,</HI> in the year 1614: where all things pa&s;|&s;ed according to the <HI>Queens</HI> de&s;ire, who notwith&s;tanding di&s;&s;ol|ved them, without giving them any &s;atisfaction at all: The Prince was faine to yield up <HI>Amboi&s;e</HI> againe, which he had got|ten at the Treaty of <HI>Saint Menehould;</HI> and that by the advice of the Mar&s;hal <HI>Bo&uuml;illon,</HI> who thought by &s;hewing the power he had over the fir&s;t Prince of the blood, who only might lawfully que|&s;tion the actions of the <HI>Queen,</HI> to render him&s;elf &s;o acceptable and con&s;iderable, that of nece&s;&s;ity he &s;hould be employed in the management of the publick affairs: But remembring that his &s;er|vices had been le&s;s recompen&s;ed than his di&s;&s;ervices, and that men &s;tood in awe of that a&s;piring &s;pirit, &s;o apt and ready for any great undertakings, he re&s;olves to imploy it again to mi&s;chief; and ta|king occa&s;ion from the ill propo&s;itions made in the States, from the treacheries di&s;covered there, by a pre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">umption to e&s;tabli&s;h the Papal in prejudice of the Royal Authority, from the Decree made by them for the con&s;ummating the Marriages with <HI>Spaine,</HI> from the prodigious greatne&s;s of the Mar&s;hal <HI>d' Ancre</HI> univer&s;al|ly envyed, and maligned, e&s;pecially in <HI>Paris;</HI> and from the di&s;|contents the Deputies the States carried back into their provinces, all which things he &s;o dexterou&s;ly ordered for his purpo&s;es, that from that foundation he rai&s;ed a <HI>broulliery</HI> of that importance, that even tho&s;e that thought not at all of meddling in it, were in&s;en&s;ibly engaged in the party.</P>
<P>The better to arrive at his aimes, the Mar&s;hal <HI>Bo&uuml;illon</HI> drew into the confederacy with the Prince all the Grandees of the Kingdome, whom either &s;ome particular injuries received, or en|vy (the ba&s;e&s;t, yet mo&s;t common vice of all) had di&s;contented; handles the Parliament of <HI>Paris</HI> &s;o hand&s;omely, that the greate&s;t part of them favoured his de&s;ign, prevailed &s;o farre upon the En|gli&s;h Emba&s;&s;adour, that he incited his Ma&s;ter to countenance his party, and made <HI>Rouvray, Desbordes-Mercier,</HI> and <HI>Bertheville,</HI> Deputies General from the A&s;&s;embly of tho&s;e of the Religion, per|&s;ons

of great abilities, and good repute, his own; &s;hewing them the remedies he would apply to the di&s;orders of the State, the advantages &s;hould thence accrue to tho&s;e of the Religion in gene|ral, and them&s;elves in particular; to wit, to the one the place of Emba&s;&s;adour into the <HI>Low Countreys,</HI> to the other the revenue of a Coun&s;ellor in the Chamber of Edicts; and to the third, the Depu|tation General; all very per&s;wa&s;ive arguments.</P>
<P>When he had thus di&s;po&s;ed his affairs, leave was granted for an A&s;&s;embly to be held at <HI>Jergeau,</HI> the fourth day of <HI>April,</HI> which place was judged improper for a free debate, and attaining the ends propo&s;ed; wherefore it was removed to <HI>Grenoble</HI> the fifteenth of <HI>July,</HI> one thou&s;and &s;ix hundredand fifteen, upon the in&s;tant reque&s;t of the Deputies General, and the Provinces, and the a&s;|&s;urance the Mar&s;hal <HI>Le&s;diguieres</HI> gave the <HI>Queen,</HI> that he would order all things &s;o, that &s;he &s;hould have no cau&s;e to feare the i&s;&s;ue of it; which place, though the va&s;t power, and well-known hu|mour of the Mar&s;hal might ca&s;t &s;ome umbrages of &s;u&s;picion on it, could not however be refu&s;ed, becau&s;e that <HI>Dauphine</HI> was a Pro|vince, in which tho&s;e of the Religion were mo&s;t numerous and powerful, and where without danger they could not be di&s;|gu&s;ted.</P>
<P>Whiles the&s;e things were in agitation, great care was taken to incen&s;e the &s;pirits of the <HI>Pari&s;ians,</HI> and with &s;uch effect, that the Parliament &s;et forth a Declaration, inviting the Prince and Peers to joyne with them in their Con&s;ultations; which though they were checked for, yet de&s;i&s;ted they not, but proceeded to the pre&s;enting of very bold Remon&s;trances to the King him&s;elf, who&s;e &s;ub&s;tance was, that he ought not to begin the fir&s;t yeare of his Majority with &s;uch ab&s;olute commands, nor accu&s;tome him&s;elf to &s;uch actions, which good Kings, as him&s;elf, very rarely had re|cour&s;e to, and after an exaggeration of the great and &s;ignal &s;ervi|ces of their Court ever &s;ince its fir&s;t e&s;tabli&s;hment, and that all the weighty and mo&s;t important affaires of the State were mana|ged by their Coun&s;el, or that the Kings had repented it, they re|mon&s;trate the di&s;plea&s;ure they had to &s;ee that the Late States &s;hould endeavour to &s;ubvert the Fundamental Law of the King|dome, by rendering the Soveraign power of the King doubtful, and problematick; that for the &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of &s;uch pernicious Maximes, and that his Soveraignty which he holds only and im|mediately from <HI>God</HI> him&s;elf, be not upon any pretence what&s;oe|ver &s;ubjected to any other power, it were nece&s;&s;ary to ordaine, that the Original Laws of the Nation, and the occa&s;ional decrees &s;oun|ded on them be renewed and put in execution; and tho&s;e held for enemies to the State, that would &s;ubject the Royal Authority to

<P>In the mean time the Prince earne&s;tly &s;ollicites the A&s;&s;embly at <HI>Grenoble,</HI> by his Agent <HI>La Hay,</HI> who delivers them his <HI>Manife&s;to,</HI> and &s;hews them the advantages would redound to tho&s;e of the Re|ligion, in ca&s;e the A&s;&s;embly would comply with him in reforming the State, and oppo&s;ing the matches with <HI>Spaine;</HI> and further en|gages him&s;elf not to conclude any thing, but by their advice. The Prince his party, nor their adherents, dur&s;t not open their mouths to &s;econd this motion; But yet the others imagining that from &s;o important an opportunity they might with good rea&s;on derive &s;trong hopes of obtaining &s;ome favour from the King, they depu|ted <HI>Champeaux, Desbordes-Mercier,</HI> and <HI>Mailleray,</HI> to him, who found him at <HI>Tours,</HI> and pre&s;ented to him five and twenty Articles of greate&s;t con&s;equence to their Intere&s;ts, humbly &s;upplicating him to vouch&s;afe them &s;ome &s;atisfaction thereupon. Of the&s;e De|puties, <HI>Desbordes-Mercier</HI> was of the Prince his faction, the other two were of the &s;ame opinion with the Duke of <HI>Rohan,</HI> who
<PB N="30" REF="20">
thought the fir&s;t equally affected to him with the others; of who&s;e abilities being very con&s;cious, he repo&s;ed an entire confidence in him: He received Letters from him from <HI>Poictiers,</HI> which gave him notice of their di&s;&s;atisfaction, and urged him to a conjun|ction with the Prince, a&s;&s;uring him that the A&s;&s;embly would be well &s;atisfied with it, and al&s;o do the like them&s;elves: The other two Deputies governed by this, joyned in this intelligence, infor|ming him moreover, how much their Maje&s;ties &s;lighted the A&s;|&s;embly, &s;o that adding to this, the refu&s;al made him of the Sur|vivance, or Rever&s;ion of the Government of <HI>Poictou,</HI> (to which his father-in-law had given his con&s;ent) contrary to the &s;olemne promi&s;es pa&s;&s;ed to him for it; together with the per&s;wa&s;ions of his brother the Duke of <HI>Soubize,</HI> who was well affected to the Prince, he began to &s;tagger a little: Be&s;ides, in his return to <HI>Saint John,</HI> from <HI>Saint Maixant,</HI> where he had been to &s;ee the Duke of <HI>Sully,</HI> he met a Gentleman belonging to the Count of <HI>Saint Paul,</HI> who de&s;ired his a&s;&s;i&s;tance to oppo&s;e the Marriages with <HI>Spaine;</HI> and was &s;econded by <HI>Saint Angel, Savignac,</HI> and <HI>Dora|dour,</HI> who in the name of all the Governours, and Nobility of the Religion, &s;ollicited the &s;ame thing, and cho&s;e him for their General, confirming him with an a&s;&s;urance, that the Count of <HI>Saint Paul</HI> would deliver up <HI>Fron&s;ac</HI> to <HI>La Force,</HI> as a pledge for the per|formance of his word.</P>
<P>The accumulation of all the&s;e things, to wit, the hope of Redeeming him&s;elf from the neglect and &s;lights lately thrown upon him; the &s;ollicitation of his brother, together with the de&s;ire he had to &s;erve tho&s;e of the Religion, overpoi&s;ed his former re&s;olu|tions, and &s;ent him into <HI>Guienne,</HI> where he found that the Count of <HI>Saint Paul,</HI> with the Romi&s;h Catholicks, had made their peace, and a great confu&s;ion among tho&s;e of the Religion; ne|verthele&s;s, having gotten together <HI>La Force, Boi&s;&s;e-Pardaillan, Chasteau-neuf, Favas,</HI> and <HI>Pami&s;&s;ant,</HI> with others of the Reli|gion, it was re&s;olved, that they &s;hould make u&s;e of the lea&s;ure af|forded them by the Kings &s;tay at <HI>Poictiers,</HI> occa&s;ioned by the &s;ickne&s;s of <HI>Madame</HI> the Prince&s;s, to prepare for a War; feeding them&s;elves with hopes to rai&s;e an Army of &s;ix thou&s;and Foot, and five hundred Hor&s;e, which at their fir&s;t Rendezvouz amoun|ted but to &s;ix hundred Foot, and fifty Hor&s;e; nor could all their power ever bring more, than two thou&s;and men together; &s;o that the King ea&s;ily, and without any interruption got to <HI>Bourdeaux,</HI> whence the <HI>Queen Mother</HI> di&s;patched <HI>Che&s;nay</HI> to the Duke of <HI>Ro|han,</HI> with very fair offers, upon condition that he would joyne with her: But neither he, nor <HI>Bois-de Cargois,</HI> who was depu|ted from the A&s;&s;embly with the like Commi&s;&s;ion, could get any

<P>The Duke of <HI>Rohan's</HI> chiefe&s;t care now was to engage in the party he had embraced, all the Towns, and Communalties of the Religion, together with the A&s;&s;embly General, whom by ex|pre&s;s Me&s;&s;engers, he adverti&s;es, that upon the refu&s;al of favou|rable an&s;wers to their propo&s;itions, and the earne&s;t &s;ollicitations of their Deputies, he had now declared in <HI>Guienne,</HI> and his bro|ther in <HI>Poictou,</HI> per&s;wading them to own their actions, and ad|here to the Prince: The Duke of <HI>Soubize,</HI> who had &s;taid at <HI>Saint John</HI> during the Kings abode at <HI>Poictiers,</HI> immediately after his departure, makes his levyes in <HI>Poictou,</HI> and <HI>Kaintonge,</HI> and &s;ud|denly took the field with four thou&s;and good Foot, and five hundred Hor&s;e, which were very opportunely ready to receive the Prince at his arrival there.</P>
<P>In the mean time the Duke of <HI>Gui&s;e</HI> conducts the <HI>Prince&s;&s;e</HI> towards <HI>Spaine,</HI> and brings thence the <HI>Infanta;</HI> who&s;e voyage afforded the Duke of <HI>Rohan</HI> the opportunity to &s;eize upon <HI>Le|ctour,</HI> by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of <HI>Fonterailles,</HI> who let him into the Town, where, when he was entered, he be&s;ieged the Ca&s;tle, and forced it to &s;urrender, before the Duke of <HI>Gui&s;e</HI> could re|lieve it, or the A&s;&s;embly of the higher <HI>Languedoc</HI> interrupt his de|&s;ign: From thence he marches to <HI>Verdun</HI> and <HI>Mauvoi&s;in,</HI> which he could by no means draw to his party; and thence to <HI>Montau|bane,</HI> which, though with much reluctancy, he got to declare for him: In this March he met with the Duke of <HI>Candale,</HI> who di&s;|covered to him his intention of embracing the Reformed Religi|on; after mutual complements they part, and the Duke of <HI>Ro|han</HI> keeps on his way towards <HI>Languedoc,</HI> to the A&s;&s;embly, who by rea&s;on they had not the freedome they expected at <HI>Grenoble,</HI> were adjourned to <HI>Ni&s;mes,</HI> where his dexterous endeavours had &s;uch happy &s;ucce&s;s, that maugre the power of <HI>Cha&s;tillon,</HI> which the vertue of his Ance&s;tors had acquired him; he de&s;troyed all his credit with them, made him&s;elf be acknowledged General of the <HI>Seuenes,</HI> and &s;o prevailed upon the A&s;&s;embly, that all the oppo&s;ition <HI>Cha&s;tillon</HI> could make in it, or in <HI>Languedoc,</HI> could not hinder their conjunction with the Prince; who&s;e <HI>Parti&s;ans</HI> &s;eeing them&s;elves backed by the Dukes of <HI>Rohan, Sully,</HI> and <HI>Soubize,</HI> at that time carried all before them; and <HI>Desbordes-Mercier, Cru&s;el,</HI> and <HI>Novialle,</HI> were deputed to carry the Act of Union

</LIST></P>
<P>At <HI>Montauban</HI> heard the Duke the fir&s;t news from the Prince, though he had di&s;patched &s;everal Me&s;&s;engers to him; and thither he &s;ent him word, That, notwith&s;tanding the oppo&s;ition of a &s;trong and well-mar&s;halled Army, he had pa&s;&s;ed the Rivers of <HI>Marne, Seine,</HI> and the <HI>Loire;</HI> and that having gotten the &s;tart of the adver&s;e Army, he was now marching to joyn with him in <HI>Guienne,</HI> de&s;iring him to march towards the <HI>Dordoigne,</HI> and for the &s;ecurity of his pa&s;&s;age, po&s;&s;e&s;s him&s;elf of &s;ome places upon that River; which he quickly did, taking among others, <HI>So&uuml;|illac,</HI> one of the be&s;t pa&s;&s;es on it, and beating up the Quarters of the Count of <HI>Lauzune's</HI> Regiment that was barricado'd in two great Villages.</P>
<P>But the Prince, in&s;tead of that, took the way of <HI>Poictou,</HI> where he very &s;ea&s;onably met with the Duke of <HI>Soubize;</HI> for he was very weak in Foot, and his whole Army &s;o hara&s;&s;ed, that had not the Town of <HI>Saint John</HI> received him, and the Duke of <HI>Sully</HI> at length, with much ado joyned with him, cau&s;ing al&s;o all the places he held in <HI>Poictou</HI> to declare for his party, he would have been but in a &s;ad condition.</P>
<P>In the mean while their Maje&s;ties return towards <HI>Tours,</HI> the Duke of <HI>Gui&s;e</HI> commanding the Army of the Mar&s;hal <HI>de Bois Dauphin,</HI> and the Duke <HI>d' Espernon,</HI> with another, having the charge of their conduct: All the&s;e conjunctions with the Prince, rai&s;ed him from the contempt he lay under, to &s;o con&s;iderable a height in the opinions of his Adver&s;aries, that he is now &s;ued to for an accommodation.</P>
<P>Now it is to be under&s;tood that the Mar&s;hal <HI>Bo&uuml;illon</HI> and the Duke of <HI>Mayne,</HI> being more &s;trictly ligued, and of greater intima|cy with the Prince than any of the whole party be&s;ides, and con|&s;equently more &s;ought after by the Court, re&s;olved to have a peace, and purcha&s;e their own conditions at the expence of the whole confederacy: In order to which, a Ce&s;&s;ation of armes is a|greed on, and the Town of <HI>Loudun</HI> made choice, of for the place of Treaty; Invitations were &s;ent al&s;o to the A&s;&s;embly General,
<PB N="33" REF="21">
to draw as near to them as <HI>Saint Foy,</HI> where the Mar&s;hal <HI>Bo&uuml;|illon</HI> was in great reputation: But the Duke of <HI>Rohan</HI> being ad|verti&s;ed by his brother of all their plots, di&s;covered to his friends in the A&s;&s;embly the whole my&s;tery, and let them know, that it were expedient the A&s;&s;embly &s;hould in&s;tantly remove to <HI>Rochell,</HI> where their authority would be greater, and their &s;trength more con&s;iderable; and that for his part he was re&s;olved to go to the Trea|ty, though not &s;ummoned to it, leaving <HI>Boe&s;&s;e Pardaillan,</HI> in his ab|&s;ence to command in <HI>Guienne.</HI></P>
<P>Before we proceed to the particularities of the Treaty, there are two very ob&s;ervable things to be taken notice of. The fir&s;t was the Duke of <HI>Nevers</HI> his arming, without declaring for either &s;ide, but pretending as a Mediatour to enforce both parties to an accommodation, out of an apprehen&s;ion he might give them to &s;way the ballance on that &s;ide he &s;hould incline to: A thing fea&s;able by the King of <HI>England,</HI> or of <HI>Spaine,</HI> but a ridiculous attempt for him. The other was nothing more Judicious, and that was a re&s;embling action of the Duke of <HI>Vendo&s;mes,</HI> who by the King's Commi&s;&s;ions had rai&s;ed a con&s;iderable force, but joyned not with the Prince till after the truce; &s;o that, he &s;erved for no|thing but to inhaunce the conditions of that party he declared for, and fru&s;trating him&s;elf of all means to make his own, being of him&s;elf not con&s;iderable, attracts to him&s;elf the <HI>odium</HI> and malig|nity borne to the whole party.</P>
<P>At this Treaty there were pre&s;ent of the Kings part, the Mar|&s;hal <HI>Bria&s;&s;ac, Villeroy,</HI> the Pre&s;ident <HI>d' Thou, d' Vi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">,</HI> and <HI>Pont|chartraine,</HI> who &s;edulou&s;ly &s;ought by &s;owing divi&s;ions among them, to weaken the confederates, and con&s;equently le&s;&s;en their conditions: The Prince, weary of the War, pretends nothing but a de&s;ire of peace, renouncing in appearance, all further thoughts of the publick affairs, and demanding only a &s;atisfacti|on of the intere&s;ts of particular per&s;ons, but re&s;olving principal|ly to find his own there too: He had ingaged to the Duke of <HI>Vendo&s;me,</HI> not to con&s;ent to any peace, unle&s;s he had the Ca&s;tle of <HI>Nantes</HI> given him: To the Duke of <HI>Longueville</HI> he promifed the <HI>Cittadell</HI> of <HI>Amiens,</HI> and to tho&s;e of the Religion, a confir|mation of the Edicts: But when the Duke of <HI>Mayne,</HI> and the Mar&s;hal <HI>Bo&uuml;illon</HI> were arrived at their ends, they quitted all thoughts, but how to make the re&s;t relinqui&s;h theirs, to effect which, they u&s;ed all manner of Artifices, the mo&s;t crafty and pregnant inventions could furni&s;h them with: But the admirable con&s;tancy of the A&s;&s;embly General at <HI>Rochell,</HI> and the firm union between the other Grandees, threw in&s;uperable difficulties in the way to their de&s;igns.</P>
<PB N="34" REF="22">
<P>But in the mid'&s;t of the&s;e tran&s;actions, the Prince falls de&s;pe|rately &s;ick, which cau&s;ed a great confu&s;ion among them all, and made them more &s;ollicitous to have this affair di&s;patched: The Duke of <HI>Sully</HI> was de&s;ired to go to the A&s;&s;embly, and repre&s;ent to them the dangers, that attended the pre&s;ent condition of things, whence he returned, with a full a&s;&s;urance of their good inclinati|ons to peace; which three dayes after, they confirmed by ten Deputies they &s;ent with an expre&s;s charge to &s;upercede all former demands, that might retard the conclu&s;ion of the Treaty; con|fining them&s;elves to an obtention only of all expedients, nece&s;&s;a|ry to confirm and &s;ecure to them their former Conce&s;&s;ions: A|mong which were the continuation of the A&s;&s;embly where it was, untill the verification of the Edict; the disbanding of the Ar|myes; the re&s;titution of <HI>Tartas;</HI> and the di&s;patch of the Com|mi&s;&s;ioners appointed to put the Edict in execution, according as the Duke of <HI>Sully</HI> had promi&s;ed them in the Princes name; which he clearly made appeare by his in&s;tructions, when the Prince re|ceded from the afore&s;aid promi&s;e: But the King's Commi&s;&s;ioners encouraged under hand, in&s;i&s;ted eagerly on the di&s;&s;olution of the A&s;&s;embly, which had like to have broken all, had not the Duke of <HI>Sully,</HI> pregnant in eva&s;ions to prevent mi&s;chiefs, firm|ly per&s;i&s;ted in his endeavours to compo&s;e the bu&s;ine&s;s, offering another Writing to the Commi&s;&s;ioners, which they approved of, and de&s;ired him to procure the Deputies of the A&s;&s;embly their a&s;|&s;ent to it al&s;o, which, with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Dukes of <HI>Rohan, Candale,</HI> and <HI>Soubize,</HI> he &s;o happily endeavoured, that they a&s;&s;ented to it, upon condition, that there might be an alteration of &s;ome termes; And fora&s;much as the Commi&s;&s;ion of the Depu|ties was too re&s;trictive, they joyntly &s;ent an expre&s;s to Remon|&s;trate to the A&s;&s;embly the nece&s;&s;ity of terminating this affaire, and to that end de&s;ire &s;uch an enlargement of their power, as &s;hould oblige them to ratifie what they &s;hould conclude in their names, and with the advice of the Grandees of the Religion: The Duke of <HI>Sully</HI> thinking he had now fini&s;hed all, carries the &s;aid Writing to the King's Commi&s;&s;ioners, with whom were pre|&s;ent the Dukes of <HI>Nevers, Maine,</HI> and <HI>Bo&uuml;illon,</HI> who all con|firmed it, and after them the Deputies al&s;o: But when he retur|ned with it again to the Commi&s;&s;ioners, they denyed what they had done; but yet as the Duke was going from them, they re|called him againe, and after much conte&s;tation came once more to an agreement: After which they all met at the Duke of <HI>Nevers</HI> his Lodgings, who treated the whole company at Dinner; where the King's Commi&s;&s;ioners, for the third time, &s;o altered the Writing, that there was nothing left of its fir&s;t
<PB N="35" REF="22">
de&s;ign; for which rea&s;on the Duke of <HI>Sully</HI> would no more trouble him&s;elf with it.</P>
<P>Whereupon the Prince cau&s;ed the Grandees to be called to &s;ign the Peace; he was yet &s;o ill that he could neither under|&s;tand it, when it was read, nor comprehend the difficulties yet to be &s;urmounted: Neverthele&s;s he called the Duke of <HI>Sully</HI> to know what hindered the &s;igning of it, which being told him, he calls <HI>Villeroy,</HI> and having whi&s;pered &s;omething to him very &s;oft|ly, pre&s;ently declares to the Duke of <HI>Sully,</HI> that <HI>Villeroy</HI> had gi|ven him the Writing ju&s;t as it was at fir&s;t de&s;igned with the ad|vice and con&s;ent of the Duke; and without expecting the An|&s;wer of the A&s;&s;embly, or any rea&s;on to the contrary, &s;igned it: Whereupon the Duke of <HI>Bo&uuml;illon</HI> had many &s;harp conte&s;ts, real, or pretended, and delu&s;ory, with <HI>Villeroy,</HI> for that he de&s;ired that the Engli&s;h Emba&s;&s;adour, who had been a great in&s;trument of the Peace, &s;hould &s;ign it too, which the other oppo&s;ed as a thing neither hand&s;ome, nor honorable for the King to &s;uffer.</P>
<P>This precipitate &s;igning of the Peace by the Prince, occa&s;i|oned great and general murmurings among the re&s;t of the Party, that &s;aw them&s;elves thus de&s;erted by tho&s;e that were the Authors of the Warre: And the Duke of <HI>Bo&uuml;illon,</HI> to enhaunce the price of the &s;ervices he had done the King, bitterly inveighs a|gain&s;t the A&s;&s;embly, branding them, and all that &s;hould abet them, with the name of Rebells; offered to march again&s;t them, and declared that he &s;hould e&s;teem for enemies to the State, all tho&s;e that upon any pretence what&s;oever, &s;hould refu&s;e to &s;igne the peace; But neither his, nor the threats of the Commi&s;&s;io|ners prevailed ought upon the others con&s;tancy. And becau&s;e this brangling was a di&s;turbance to the Prince, the whole com|pany removed to the Counte&s;s of <HI>Soi&s;&s;ons</HI> Lodgings, where e|very one, all other difficulties being cleared, to avoid di&s;putes for the precedency, &s;ub&s;cribed his approbation a|part, and none, but the Prince, and the Deputies, &s;igned the Declaration.</P>
<P>But when all was done, this War wrought no alteration at all in the publick affairs, but what was procured by tho&s;e of the King's party, who made u&s;e of this occa&s;ion to revenge them|&s;elves upon their enemies: So <HI>Villeroy,</HI> and the Pre&s;ident <HI>Janin,</HI> whom the Chancellour <HI>de Sillery</HI> had formerly put by, that he might have the &s;ole admini&s;tration of all affaires, cau&s;ed the &s;eals to be taken from him, and committed to the Pre&s;ident <HI>Du Vair:</HI> But <HI>Villeroy</HI> nothing advantaged him&s;elf hereby; for the Mar&s;hal <HI>d' Ancre,</HI> conceiving a jealou&s;ie, that at the Treaty he held cor|re&s;pondence with the contrary party, to out him of the <HI>Cittadell</HI> of
<PB N="36" REF="23">
<HI>Amiens,</HI> cau&s;ed his Office of Secretary of State, to be given to <HI>Mangot.</HI></P>
<P>When this bu&s;ine&s;s was thus concluded, every one departed, but diver&s;ely affected, and very ill &s;atisfied one with another; and the next day came the full power from the A&s;&s;embly to their Deputies to conclude the Peace. The Mar&s;hal <HI>Bo&uuml;illon,</HI> and the Duke of <HI>Trimo&uuml;ille,</HI> to in&s;inuate them&s;elves the more into the King's favour, engaged them&s;elves to the Commi&s;&s;ioners, by an Act under their hands and &s;eals, to rout the A&s;&s;embly, and all that &s;hould pre&s;ume to ju&s;tifie them, in ca&s;e they refu&s;ed to di&s;|&s;olve, after the &s;ix weeks prorogation accorded them, was ex|pired.</P>
<P>If the number of the di&s;contents on the Princes &s;ide was great, it was not le&s;s on the other: The favour of the Mar&s;hal <HI>d' Ancre</HI> was more in&s;upportable to tho&s;e, that upheld, than tho&s;e that op|po&s;ed him: and he al&s;o perceiving him&s;elf more tyranni&s;ed by his creatures, than his enemies, made the late reconciled party believe he would enter into a firm and &s;trict amity with them; which the Duke of <HI>Gui&s;e</HI> &s;u&s;pecting, he al&s;o, to cro&s;s the Mar|&s;hal <HI>d' Ancre</HI>'s aimes, &s;eeks after an union with them too: And in order to it, makes his applications to the Mar&s;hal <HI>Bo&uuml;illon;</HI> who fed him &s;till with very fair words, and hopes, that in ca&s;e he failed of his end at the Court, he might have a good occa&s;ion to intangle it in new perplexities.</P>
<P>Some dayes before the conclu&s;ion of the Peace, it was pro|po&s;ed in the Prince his Council, that the Grandees of his party &s;hould enter into an inviolable League among&s;t them&s;elves, that two of them &s;hould alwayes in their turns, re&s;ide at Court, whi|le&s;t the others kept at a greater di&s;tance from it; and that every one of them &s;hould embrace the particular intere&s;ts of the others; The Mar&s;hal <HI>Bo&uuml;illon</HI> rejected that Propo&s;ition, as un&s;ea&s;onable, for that, having occa&s;ion to di&s;-oblige the greate&s;t part of them, he fore&s;aw this might di&s;cover his intentions; and be&s;ides, he was yet de&s;irous to derive his advantage from the merits, and e|&s;teem of his &s;ervices: But after the Treaty was concluded, him|&s;elf renewed the former propo&s;al, which was then al&s;o as un&s;ea|&s;onable, becau&s;e their minds were now too much varied from what they were, and they &s;o jealous one of another, that every one &s;teer|ed his cour&s;e by his own particular intere&s;t.</P>
<P>The Prince went to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the government of <HI>Ber|ry,</HI> given him in exchange for that of <HI>Guienne;</HI> The Duke of <HI>Mayne,</HI> and the Mar&s;hal <HI>Bo&uuml;illon</HI> to the Court, to try how the pul&s;es beat there, but principally to reap the fruit of their &s;er|vices; The Duke of <HI>Sully</HI> to his government of <HI>Poictou;</HI> The

Duke of <HI>Rohan</HI> to <HI>Rochell,</HI> to inform the A&s;&s;embly of what had pa&s;&s;ed at the treaty of <HI>Loudun,</HI> and to procure a nomination of good Deputies general: But the Court <HI>Caball</HI> being uni|ted with the Prince his faction, and the hopes of favour, gratifications, and pen&s;ions, he gave to tho&s;e that &s;hould incline to his will wholly governed them, &s;o that <HI>Bertheville,</HI> and <HI>Mainald</HI> were cho&s;en.</P>
<P>The Duke of <HI>Rohan</HI> &s;eeing how he was hated at Court, and that the &s;ucce&s;s of all things thwarted his projection, re&s;olves to make an E&s;&s;ay upon the Duke of <HI>Sully</HI> for the government of <HI>Poictou,</HI> of whom when he had obtained a demi&s;&s;ion of it, his Patents were prepared, according to the tenor of the Articles of the Treaty, upon condition that he &s;hould go to receive them at Court, which he re&s;olved to do; and there delivers him&s;elf free|ly to the <HI>Queen,</HI> telling her, that the &s;lights &s;he had thrown up|on him, had induced him to let her Maje&s;ty know, that he was neither voide of re&s;entments, nor de&s;titute of power; that, it was true, he had &s;erved and obliged a mo&s;t ingrateful per&s;on, which he was very &s;en&s;ible of, and that if &s;he plea&s;ed to vouch|&s;afe him a pardon, and amne&s;ty for his actions again&s;t her, and admit him again to her favour, he vowed that except the party of the Religion, he would devote his mo&s;t faithful &s;ervices to her, a|gain&s;t all the world be&s;ides; of which offer and prote&s;tation &s;he te&s;tified her belief by her acceptance of it.</P>
<P>But to return to the Mar&s;hal <HI>Bo&uuml;illon;</HI> he employed the ut|termo&s;t &s;trength of his whole abilities to gain an admi&s;&s;ion to the helm of State, declaring that he was the only man could, at his plea&s;ure, rule, and di&s;po&s;e of the Prince, who was al&s;o the only per&s;on could prejudice the authority of the <HI>Queen,</HI> and that con|&s;equently his &s;atisfaction, and employment would free them from any further apprehen&s;ions, what&s;oever: But the Mar&s;hal <HI>d' An|cre,</HI> who had ingro&s;&s;ed all the power, being the only Favourite, and intended to change the whole Council, to place therein creatures of his own, thought it not convenient to &s;uffer the intro|duction of &s;uch a one; which the other perceiving, &s;tuffs the Princes head with new jealou&s;ies, to prevent his returne to the Court.</P>
<P>There were the Counte&s;s of <HI>Soi&s;&s;ons</HI> of the one &s;ide, and the Prince&s;s of <HI>Conde</HI> of the other, that extreamly rejoyced at the report of the Prince his intentions to return thither; but all (&s;o jealous were they one of another) agreed to divert him from them, unle&s;s it was by their means that he came; which he knowing very well, waved them all, and by the mediation of <HI>Rochefort,</HI> and the Arch-Bi&s;hop of <HI>Bourges,</HI> &s;ecretly made his

<P>Coming to <HI>Paris</HI> again&s;t the good liking of tho&s;e afore-men|tioned, he was welcomed with loud acclamations, and applau|&s;es, and re&s;umed a great power in the State: The Duke of <HI>Ro|han,</HI> with the <HI>Queens</HI> permi&s;&s;ion, gave him a vi&s;it, and &s;harp|ly reproached him for &s;igning the Peace, without expecting the Commi&s;&s;ion from the A&s;&s;embly; which he excu&s;ed, &s;aying, that he was induced to it by an apprehen&s;ion he had, le&s;t the Duke &s;hould hinder their granting it; and when he afterwards under|&s;tood that he was re&s;tored to the <HI>Queens</HI> favour, he told him he was very glad of it, for that he had now brought no other re|&s;olutions with him, but to enjoy him&s;elf, mind his own affairs, and no more to intermeddle in any factions, but entirely to ad|here to the <HI>King,</HI> the <HI>Queen,</HI> and the Mar&s;hal <HI>d' Ancre:</HI> And when the di&s;&s;atisfaction of the Great ones, and principally of the Mar&s;hal <HI>Bo&uuml;illon,</HI> who was &s;uppo&s;ed to have an ab&s;olute power over him, was objected to him; his an&s;wer was, That he now very well perceived his drift, and the &s;ubtleties he u&s;ed to per|&s;wade him, that the welfare of the State con&s;i&s;ted either in peace or War, according as he was plea&s;ed, or di&s;plea&s;ed, and that he would no more &s;toop to that Lure.</P>

And one day, having a&s;&s;embled the chiefe&s;t of his Confederates, to con&s;ult about the killing of the Mar&s;hal <HI>d' Ancre,</HI> the Duke of <HI>Maine,</HI> who was &s;uppo&s;ed to the mo&s;t zealous in the bu&s;ine&s;s, offered to kill him him&s;elf, provided that the Prince would be there, and that it was nece&s;&s;ary to know his re&s;olution therein; the Mar&s;hal <HI>Bo&uuml;illon</HI> replyed, That they ought to beware of that, but that he would undertake to make the Prince avow the acti|on when it was executed, but that it was dangerous to impart it to him before, and that he &s;hould not by any means have any notice of it, till it were ready to be put in execution, that he might not have lea&s;ure to retract: But the ob&s;tinacy of the Duke of <HI>Maine</HI> carried it, and the Prince when he was acquainted with what they had re&s;olved on, whether it was, that he feared the i&s;&s;ue of it, or that for this once he would be a man of his word, that very Evening let the Mar&s;hal <HI>d' Ancre</HI> know, by the Arch-Bi&s;hop of <HI>Bourges,</HI> that he could by no means abandon the Duke of <HI>Longueville,</HI> and that he revoked the promi&s;e he had made to protect him: Whereupon the Mar&s;hal, the &s;ame night po&s;ted into <HI>Normandy;</HI> and there &s;eeing him&s;elf for&s;aken by the Prince, and many of the Great ones, combined to a&s;&s;ault him in the Court it &s;elf, contrived how he might prevent them: Informs the <HI>Queen</HI> by &s;ome of his Confidents, that the <HI>Prince</HI> deceives her, that the Mar&s;hal <HI>Bo&uuml;illon</HI> amu&s;es her, that many of the great Nobility were re&s;olved to deve&s;t her of her authority, and that the bu&s;ine&s;s was already come to &s;uch a point, that &s;he had no other remedy left her, but to &s;eize upon their per&s;ons; on which &s;he re&s;olved, with <HI>Mangot</HI> the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Lueon,</HI> and <HI>Barbin,</HI> creatures of the Mar&s;hal: And on the fir&s;t day of <HI>Se|ptember,</HI> upon a <HI>Thur&s;day</HI> at noon, was the Prince arre&s;ted in the <HI>Louvre,</HI> by <HI>Themines,</HI> who for that action was created Mar&s;hal of <HI>France;</HI> and that which is very remarkable in this, is, That up|on the &s;ame day of the month, and of the week, and at the &s;ame houre was he born: They thought to have &s;urprized the Duke of <HI>Maine,</HI> and the Mar&s;hal <HI>Bo&uuml;illon</HI> there al&s;o; but the

This arre&s;t cau&s;ed a great tu|mult in <HI>Paris,</HI> which was encrea&s;ed by the Prince his Mother, and many Gentlemen, who animated the people of the Suburbs of <HI>Saint Germaine</HI> to plunder, and raze the Mar&s;hal <HI>d' Ancre</HI>'s hou&s;e, which they found &s;o &s;weet an employment, that the pil|lage of it la&s;ted two dayes; and indeed great prudence was it, not to oppo&s;e them in the heat of their fury: For the next day <HI>Crequi</HI> Colonel of the Regiment of the Guards, with one com|pany of them, and another of the Citizens, ea&s;ily took them off from the prey, which in the height of the hurly burly would have proved a greater difficulty.</P>
<P>Their Maje&s;ties gave notice of this Mutiny to tho&s;e of the Nobility that remained in <HI>Paris,</HI> and likewi&s;e to the chiefe&s;t of the Council; among whom, the Duke of <HI>Sully</HI> &s;pake his mind freely, and declaring his di&s;like of the action, advi&s;ed them to compo&s;e tho&s;e differences by the intervention of the Pope his <HI>Nuncio,</HI> and other Emba&s;&s;adours, but &s;o, as that the full pow|er to determine all &s;hould remaine &s;till in the King, and the Queen his Mother.

opportunity to let him know the &s;ervice he intended to the Queen his Mi&s;tre&s;&s;e, to which the Duke of <HI>Montbazon, Luynes</HI> his Father-in-law, was al&s;o much inclined. <HI>Barbin,</HI> (by the means of <HI>Bour|nonville,</HI> Governour of the <HI>Bastille,</HI> where he was a pri&s;oner) gave the Queen intelligence of what had pa&s;&s;ed, advi&s;ing her to write letters to the King, <HI>Luynes,</HI> and to the Duke of <HI>Montbazon;</HI> to the fir&s;t, full of complaints of vindication of her &s;elf, and of re&s;pect; to the other two to do her all good offices to the King: the draughts of which letters were fir&s;t carried to the Duke of <HI>Rohan,</HI> who amended them, and corrected the acrimony of &s;ome expre&s;&s;i|ons in them: But the Bi&s;hop who was to carry the&s;e letters, in who <HI>Barbin</HI> greatly confided, proved fel&s;e, and mo&s;t perfidiou&s;ly betrayed the whole plot; yet, according to the in&s;tructions he received from <HI>Deagent,</HI> made he &s;everal journeys to the Queen, but with treacherous purpo&s;es to work the ruine of her, and all el&s;e that had a hand in this bu&s;ine&s;&s;e: But &s;eeing that this de&s;ign tended only to a reconciliation, and yeilded no colourable pre|tences to ground any accu&s;ation on, they flie to &s;ubtilties; and in <HI>Bournonville</HI>'s name, de&s;ire a Ring from the Queen, as a te&s;timony of her acceptance of his &s;ervice, for that being brother-in-law to the Mar&s;hal <HI>Vitry,</HI> he could not otherwi&s;e believe &s;he could have any good thoughts of him: The Queen, though &s;omewhat &s;urprized with this demand, yet could it not rai&s;e any jealou&s;ies in her, for that the Bi&s;hop who was employed in all the&s;e errands, was a creature of <HI>Barbins,</HI> made &s;ome difficulty to part with the Ring he de&s;ired, as unwilling to give any thing that was not wor|thy of her, but promi&s;ed to have one bought purpo&s;ely at <HI>Paris;</HI> But he importuned her &s;o much, that &s;he took one from one of the Ladies attending her, and gave it him: The Bi&s;hop carries it to <HI>Deagent,</HI> who kept that, and cau&s;ed another to be made ju&s;t like it, which he conveyed to <HI>Bournonville,</HI> as if &s;he had voluntarily, and of her own accord &s;ent it him: After this they infu&s;ed jea|lou&s;ies into the King, that the Nobility had a de&s;ign to &s;urprize the <HI>Louvre</HI> to introduce the Queen, and re&s;tabli&s;h her in her former authority, and that all that were of the con&s;piracy, wore a blew Ring on their finger, which was the cognizance of the party: And <HI>Luynes</HI> one day &s;huts the Duke of <HI>Rohan</HI> into his chamber, where he entertained him with di&s;cour&s;es, that the King was cer|tainly informed that he was alwayes much devoted to the Queens &s;ervice, that he knew all his machinations for that end, and the &s;ecret negotiations of <HI>La Ferte;</HI> but of regard of his alliance to him, he had prevailed with the King to pardon him, and there|fore now it was fit he &s;hould tell him all: This propo&s;ition was with much di&s;daine rejected by the Duke, who replyed, that he

was no Informer, and that he was glad they knew his actions which had no other aime than the King's &s;ervice; that be confe&s;&s;ed he was a &s;ervant to the Queen-Mother, and that it was the duty of every good Frenchman &s;o to be.</P>
<P>After all the&s;e contrivances, and many others which never came to my knowledge <HI>La Ferte</HI> was taken pri&s;oner, and committed to the <HI>Ba&s;tille,</HI> confronted with <HI>Barbin,</HI> and both of them were brought to their tryal; and notwith&s;tanding the importunate &s;ollicitations made in favour of them, and were admitted of purpo&s;ely to in|tangle more people, the re&s;ult of all was, the depriving <HI>Bournon|ville</HI> of the <HI>Ba&s;tille,</HI> the perpetual bani&s;hment of <HI>Barbin,</HI> and of <HI>La Ferte</HI> for five years, who, notwith&s;tanding never &s;tirred at all from his Ma&s;ter.</P>
<P>The&s;e violent procedures filled the Queen with great fears and jealou&s;ies, and made her more &s;olicitous to free her &s;elf from this captivity, being now well a&s;&s;ured that the hopes <HI>Luynes</HI> gave her of it, &s;ometimes by <HI>Cadanet,</HI> &s;ometimes by <HI>Modene</HI> were but only to amu&s;e her, e&s;pecially when &s;he &s;aw that the negotiation of <HI>Ar|noux</HI> the Je&s;uite and the King's Confe&s;&s;our came to nothing; this Je&s;uite made the King &s;olemnly &s;wear at Confe&s;&s;ion, never to di&s;|like what <HI>Lnynes</HI> did, nor to meddle him&s;elf with any State affairs.</P>
<P>The con&s;ideration of all the&s;e things made her at length re|&s;olve to work her enlargement; and to effect it, by the advice of the Mar&s;hal <HI>Bo&uuml;illon,</HI> &s;he made choice of the Duke <HI>d' Espernon,</HI> whom &s;he knew to be a man of great power, valour, and prudence: But he was di&s;plea&s;ed with her, and came to Court with full in|tention to &s;ide with the King; he mu&s;t therefore be brought a|bout; which the Queens &s;ervants deriving much advantage from the Favourites ill conduct, very dextrou&s;ly performed: And fir&s;t, they terrifie <HI>Luynes</HI> with the great power, and haughty humour of the Duke <HI>d' Espernon;</HI> qualities not tolerable by one who aimes at a general adoration: On the other&s;ide they exa&s;perate the Duke, who was of a touchy nature, and unaccu&s;tomed to a ba&s;e and &s;ervile &s;ubjection: The fir&s;t occa&s;ion they took from his at|tempts to promote his younge&s;t &s;onne to a <HI>Cardinalat,</HI> for the which he was the fir&s;t upon the Roll, and received all po&s;&s;ible a&s;|&s;urance of it, but was put by, by the contrivances of <HI>Villeroy,</HI> who preferred <HI>Marquemont:</HI> But <HI>Villeroy</HI> dying immediately after, he continues his pur&s;uit, with great hopes &s;till: But the Cardinal <HI>de Retz</HI> having made <HI>Deagent,</HI> and by that means gained <HI>Luynes,</HI> car|ried it; but not without obliging him&s;elf by promi&s;es unworthy a per&s;on of quality, with poor and infamous &s;ubmi&s;&s;ions, which he &s;till &s;o religiou&s;ly ob&s;erved, that being afterwards made Pre|&s;ident

<P>This was opportunely &s;econded by another occa&s;ion derived from the Keeper of the Seals, <HI>Du Vair,</HI> who, hurried by his own pride, or the in&s;tigation of tho&s;e that were de&s;irous of new trou|bles, would needs take place at the Council-table, of all the Dukes and Peers of <HI>France:</HI> The Duke <HI>d' E&s;pernon,</HI> as the mo&s;t ancient that was then there, complains, in the name of all the re&s;t, of it to the King, who took it ill from him, and the in|tere&s;t of the Gown-men, was preferred before that of the Peers of <HI>France:</HI> This &s;tomached him &s;o, that he brake out into many bitter invectives, even again&s;t the King him&s;elf; &s;o that it was no hard matter to per&s;wade him that there was a de&s;igne to &s;end him to the <HI>Ba&s;tille,</HI> con&s;idering the late Pre&s;idents before his eyes: The Queens &s;ervants, (who would not di&s;cover any thing of their in|tentions to him while he remained in <HI>Paris</HI>) &s;o hand&s;omely im|proved his jealou&s;ies, that one morning very early, and without taking leave of any body, he goes thence to <HI>Metz.</HI> When he was there, <HI>Ruccelay,</HI> the chief contriver, and manager of the whole project begins with him, by moving a reconciliation be|tween him, and the Mar&s;hal <HI>Bo&uuml;illon;</HI> and then imparts to him the Queens de&s;igne, with her reque&s;t to him, to procure her li|berty, with many large promi&s;es annexed to it, of which, in &s;uch ca&s;es none are &s;paring: The almo&s;t in&s;uperable difficulties and dangers of this enterpri&s;e, together with the ingratitude, the u&s;ual recompence Princes reward great &s;ervices withal, at fir&s;t &s;tartled, and cau&s;ed &s;ome he&s;itation in the Duke of <HI>Espernon:</HI> But then the glory would attend the execution of &s;o high and noble a de&s;igne, the indignation he conceived at the &s;mall regard was had of him, together with his de&s;ire of revenge, (pa&s;&s;ions predomi|nating in all great courages) overcame all the &s;ugge&s;tions of his fears: When he had re&s;olved on it, he proceeds in it with that caution, &s;ecre&s;ie, and good Fortune, that having made all nece&s;|&s;ary provi&s;ions for <HI>Metz,</HI> where the King, purpo&s;ely to keep him at a di&s;tance from the Court, where he feared him, amu&s;ed him with pretended and imaginary de&s;ignes, he pa&s;&s;es through <HI>France</HI> into his governments of <HI>Xaintonge,</HI> and <HI>Angoulmois,</HI> and there effected the Queen-Mothers deliverance, on the one and twen|tieth of <HI>February</HI> one thou&s;and &s;ix hundred and nineteen, who came from <HI>Blois</HI> to <HI>Loches,</HI> a place belonging to the Duke, who there went to receive her with two or three hundred Gentlemen, who all conducted her to <HI>Angoule&s;me.</HI></P>
<P>This e&s;cape of the Queen cau&s;ed a great confu&s;ion at the Court, where it was conceived that her party was much more

numerous, or that it might quickly &s;well to a bigger bulk; where|fore great preparations were made for war, that the en&s;uing peace might be more advantageous: The command of the Army to be &s;ent again&s;t the Queen was given to the Duke of <HI>Mayne,</HI> who was thought to be the mo&s;t an enemy to her, and mo&s;t faithful to <HI>Luynes;</HI> and becau&s;e it was conceived that it would be acceptable to him, to him al&s;o was committed the charge of the negotiati|on of <HI>Bethune:</HI> Sollicitations were al&s;o made in the behalf of the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Lucon</HI> (who till then had remained in exile in <HI>Avignon</HI>) for his return to the Queen, and inforced with promi&s;es made in his name, by his brother in Law <HI>Pont Courlay,</HI> to incline the Queen to &s;uch a peace as &s;hould &s;hoot with the King's de&s;ires, and al&s;o to &s;owe jealou&s;ies between the principal authors of her de|liverance; in which he failed neither of his endeavours, nor &s;uc|ce&s;&s;e. For <HI>Rucelay,</HI> who had as largely contributed to her liber|ty as any one, left her in di&s;content, and drew with him the Mar|que&s;&s;e of <HI>Mauny,</HI> and <HI>Themines,</HI> who afterwards proved one of the greate&s;t enemies to the Queen, who found her &s;elf but in a bad condition to engage in a war, by rea&s;on that many envied the gallant action of the Duke <HI>d' Espernon,</HI> few would &s;ubmit to his imperious humour, and every one believed that all would end in peace, and were therefore unwilling to imbarque in an affair, by which they &s;hould gaine nothing but the King's di&s;plea&s;ure, and hatred, while&s;t others carried away the glory of the enterpri&s;e: For which rea&s;on al&s;o the Duke of <HI>Rohan,</HI> being &s;ought to, by the Queen, &s;ent her word, that he was much troubled that he was not privie to, and imployed in the beginning of her de&s;igne; which if he had, he would have &s;erved her mo&s;t faithfully: But being at Court then when &s;he made her e&s;cape, he was commanded by the King to his government of <HI>Poictou,</HI> to pre&s;erve it in peace; that, for his part he would do her no harme, but advi&s;ed her to make a peace, in which he was confident <HI>Bethune</HI> would &s;erve her; and that being in full liberty, and &s;ecurity, &s;he would have more favorable conveniencies to rai&s;e a greater number of &s;ervants and friends than at pre&s;ent: <HI>Schomberg</HI> did cleare otherwi&s;e for to en|deare him&s;elf beyond the other Zealots for her ruine; he laid a plot to blow her up by firing the Magazine at <HI>Angoule&s;me,</HI> which was happily di&s;covered, and prevented. At length was a peace con|cluded, and near <HI>Tours</HI> was the interview between the King and the Queen-mother, to whom was given the government of <HI>An|jou,</HI> and for her better &s;ecurity, the Ca&s;tles of <HI>Angiers, Pont de C&eacute;,</HI> and <HI>Chinon.</HI></P>

<P>The Duke of <HI>Rohan,</HI> who was his friend, patronized him &s;till at Court, and, &s;eeing that the Kings Commi&s;&s;ioner <HI>Renard</HI> ca&s;t all the blame of the ill &s;ucce&s;&s;e he had in his voyage upon <HI>La Force,</HI> u&s;ed all means po&s;&s;ible to compo&s;e the bu&s;ine&s;&s;e, &s;hewing that if the Province of <HI>Bearn</HI> &s;hould addre&s;&s;e them&s;elves to the Reformed Churches of <HI>France,</HI> their particular might grow into a general cau&s;e, from who&s;e circum&s;tances might arrive &s;ome ac|cidents not ea&s;ie to be remedied, and that it was the wi&s;e&s;t cour&s;e to quench this fire before it were throughly kindled: That it was mo&s;t rea&s;onable (&s;ince the thing was begun) that the King &s;hould receive &s;atisfaction, and the Countrey al&s;o &s;hould be &s;ecured; and that partial per&s;ons were mo&s;t unfit to be imployed in it: The&s;e rea&s;ons were the better reli&s;hed, for that they already began to di&s;cover &s;everal A&s;&s;emblies in the Provinces, and to fear the event of them: And now were things in &s;o fair a way, that the Duke of <HI>Rohan</HI> had obtained a re-imbur&s;ement of the like &s;um of money re&s;tored to the Eccle&s;ia&s;tiques, to be had out of the next receipts; and in ca&s;e of non-payment, permi&s;&s;ion was granted to the Coun|trey to &s;eize again upon the goods of the Eccle&s;ia&s;tiques.

<P>_AND now are we arrived at the &s;our&s;e of all our evils, and fatal commencement of the Warres again&s;t tho&s;e of the Reformed Religion. The King, having thus happily put a period to this War, goes to <HI>Bourdeaux,</HI> where he &s;uppre&s;&s;es the authority of the Duke of <HI>Maine,</HI> and commands the <HI>Bearnois</HI> that the late Decree be put in execu|tion: But they, neither knowing how to obey him, nor de&s;end them&s;elves, oblige him in per&s;on to a voyage into <HI>Bearn:</HI> And there it was they fir&s;t began to &s;light and laugh at the performance of their parol engagements; For the next day after their arrival, and a &s;olemne promi&s;e made to the <HI>Bearnois</HI> to pre&s;erve their pri|viledges entire, were they totally deve&s;ted of them, by the re-uni|on

of <HI>Beane</HI> to <HI>France,</HI> and changing, contrary to the engage|ment of their faith given the Governour of <HI>Navarrins.</HI></P>
<P>Moreover it is to be known, that the Deputy general <HI>Favas,</HI> who was in pur&s;uit of the government of <HI>Lectour</HI> in the behalf of his &s;on, the more to induce the Court to yeild to his reque&s;t, threatned to &s;end to tho&s;e at <HI>Rochel</HI> to convene the A&s;&s;embly ge|neral, according to the power given them by the A&s;&s;embly at <HI>Lou|dun:</HI> But &s;eeing, that prevailed not to compa&s;&s;e his de&s;igne, and not con&s;idering how un&s;ea&s;onable it was, he writes to tho&s;e of <HI>Rochel,</HI> from <HI>Bourdeaux,</HI> to cau&s;e the &s;aid Convention, advi&s;ing them al&s;o to repair their fortifications; And thus are the publique continually &s;wallowed up by private Intere&s;ts.</P>
<P>When the King was returned to <HI>Paris,</HI> the A&s;&s;embly general meets at <HI>Rochel,</HI> and <HI>Favas</HI> &s;till followes the Court, to finde &s;ome means to accompli&s;h his de&s;ires; His Maje&s;ty in the fir&s;t place, forbids the holding of the &s;aid A&s;&s;embly, next commands their di&s;|&s;olution, and la&s;tly declares them Traytors: The chief of tho&s;e of the Religion, conceiving that great prejudice to them would attend their ob&s;tinacy, were of opinion that they were be&s;t to di&s;|&s;olve upon certain conditions, of which they had hopes given them from the Court: But the Letters which <HI>Favas</HI> &s;ent thence, together with the particular di&s;contents of <HI>La Force,</HI> and <HI>Chastil|lon,</HI> by rea&s;on of the hard u&s;age the one received in his Offices, and a de&s;ire the other had to have more, occa&s;ioned the continuance of the A&s;&s;embly; whence the King took a pretence to pro&s;ecute his de&s;ignes to the uttermo&s;t, to which, the ba&s;ene&s;&s;e, and trea|chery of the Governours of the Cautionary Towns facilitated his acce&s;&s;e.</P>
<P>It is to be ob&s;erved, that before the Kings departure from <HI>Paris,</HI> the Dukes of <HI>Nevers</HI> and <HI>Maine</HI> were in great di&s;content retired into <HI>Champegne,</HI> and the Count of <HI>Soi&s;&s;ons</HI> to <HI>Frontevault:</HI> The Duke <HI>de Luynes,</HI> that he might not leave &s;uch thorns in his back, was very de&s;irous to reconcile them; and to move them to it, <HI>Fa|vas</HI> was &s;ent to informe the Dukes, that he was now going to the A&s;&s;embly with full &s;atisfaction to all their demands, and that it would be prudence in them to comply, before the determination of that affair; the like &s;peech was made to the Count of <HI>Soi&s;&s;ons</HI> by <HI>Villarnoul,</HI> which wrought all their returns to the Court, and occa&s;ioned the reconciliation between the Cardinal <HI>de Gui&s;e,</HI> and the Duke of <HI>Nevers.</HI></P>

<P>The fir&s;t te&s;timony of the lubricity, and in&s;incerity of their words, was given at <HI>Saumure,</HI> which, to the violation of the Faith engaged in his Patent, was taken from <HI>Du Ple&s;&s;is Mornay:</HI> The &s;ame &s;ucce&s;&s;e al&s;o had all the Townes in <HI>Poi|ctou.</HI></P>

<P>Another fear al&s;o perplexed him, le&s;t in his ab&s;ence, <HI>Cha|stillon</HI> &s;hould recall his Troops, to prevent which, he oppo&s;ed a|gain&s;t him an A&s;&s;embly of five Provinces, <HI>viz.</HI> The Lower <HI>Lan|guedoc,</HI> the <HI>Sevenes, Vivaretz,</HI> the Upper <HI>Languedoc,</HI> and <HI>Dauphine,</HI> who impowered him to detaine the &s;upplyes he already had, and to rai&s;e more in ca&s;e he had occa&s;ion for them.</P>
<P>Things being in this condition, the Duke &s;ends to di&s;cover what Fordes were pa&s;&s;able and not guarded, furni&s;hes him&s;elf with good guides, and formes his de&s;ign to relieve <HI>Montauban,</HI> at the &s;ame time, by the way of <HI>Ville-nouvelle,</HI> by <HI>Saint Anto|nin,</HI> and of <HI>Ville-Bourbon</HI> by <HI>Carming.</HI> The fir&s;t of which is five Leagues di&s;tant from <HI>Montauban,</HI> the other ten; &s;o that he inten|ded to put in his greate&s;t relief, con&s;i&s;ting all of Foot, on that &s;ide; and the le&s;&s;er, compo&s;ed of <HI>Dragoons,</HI> and three&s;core <HI>Reformado's</HI> only, on the other.</P>

<P>As for the other relief, commanded by <HI>Beau&s;ort,</HI> one of his Colonels, it was better ordered: He marched from <HI>Ca&s;tres</HI> in the evening, with about a thou&s;and or twelve hundred men, comes to <HI>Lombez</HI> about one of the clock in the morning, where he &s;tays till the next night, then fordes the <HI>Tarn</HI> at <HI>Grave,</HI> marches all night, and the next evening about five of the clock comes to <HI>Saint Antonin,</HI> without any ill <HI>rencontre</HI> at all: There he &s;tays all the next day, and in the evening &s;ets forward towards <HI>Mon|tauban.</HI></P>
<P>But the fal&s;ene&s;s of the guides he had taken up at <HI>Saint Anto|nin,</HI> who betrayed him, forced him to return thither againe: Three dayes after they &s;ent him a guide from <HI>Montauban,</HI> who &s;afely conducted him over the River <HI>Veyrou</HI> at a Forde, and brought him very well within half a League of the Town; whence, notwith&s;tanding the &s;everal parties both of Hor&s;e and Foot he perpetually met with between that and the Town, and the many Redoubts and trenches that ob&s;tructed his pa&s;&s;age, he vanqui&s;h|ed all tho&s;e difficulties, and put &s;even hundred men, and nine Colours into <HI>Montauban:</HI> But <HI>Beaufort</HI> him&s;elf came &s;hort of it, being taken in this brave action: And it is to be ob&s;erved, that this relief which con&s;i&s;ted all of Foot, marched every day almo&s;t eighteen Leagues in an enemies Countrey, forded through two dangerous Rivers, and pa&s;&s;ed through the mid'&s;t of two Royal Armies that lay in wait to defeat them.</P>
<P>The Duke of <HI>Rohan</HI> took a double cour&s;e to pro&s;per the de|&s;ign of this relief; one was by &s;ending <HI>Calonges,</HI> and <HI>Des-I&s;les</HI> with <HI>Desplans</HI> to con&s;ult with tho&s;e before <HI>Montauban,</HI> about &s;ome way of accommodation; the other was, by marching at the &s;ame time that <HI>Beaufort</HI> did, with forty Colours of Foot, and tho&s;e few Hor&s;e he had, towards <HI>Lauraguais:</HI> So that when the Duke of <HI>Angoule&s;me</HI> was ready to pur&s;ue <HI>Beaufort</HI> with all his Cavalry, he received intelligence that the Duke of <HI>Rohan,</HI> with the greate&s;t part of his forces, was upon his march for <HI>Laura|guais,</HI> which put &s;uch a Dilemma on him, that he knew not which way to turn; and in the mean time <HI>Beaufort</HI> pa&s;&s;es through the mid'&s;t of his Army, and the Duke of <HI>Rohan,</HI> the day follow|ing, return'd to <HI>Castres,</HI> and &s;ent back his Troops to the places whence he had drawn them.</P>

<P>Whil'&s;t he was upon his journey, the principal inhabitants of <HI>Ni&s;mes,</HI> making good u&s;e of his ab&s;ence, took occa&s;ion to procure a Declaration of the general Council of the Town, that the Go|vernment of <HI>Bri&s;on</HI> was no longer &s;upportable, that <HI>Rohan</HI> &s;hould be reque&s;ted to approve of this re&s;ult of their deliberations, and that they might be permitted to live under the &s;ole authority of their own Con&s;uls, till a more urgent nece&s;&s;ity &s;hould require a Governour, and that then they would accept of any one he &s;hould plea&s;e to place over them; and that he would with all &s;peed re|pair to their town to prevent any di&s;orders might &s;urvene: Where|upon he went thither, and there approved of and ratified this act of their Council. At the &s;ame time was there held an A&s;&s;embly at <HI>Ni&s;mes</HI> to take order for the &s;ecuring of their harve&s;t; to whom <HI>Bri&s;on</HI> addre&s;&s;ed his complaints; But the A&s;&s;embly waved them, and approved of the determination of the Council, and the Dukes confirmation of it: <HI>Bri&s;on</HI> &s;eeing he could not this way arrive at his aimes, goes to <HI>Montpellier,</HI> and in all places endeavours to &s;tir up the people again&s;t the Duke of <HI>Rohan,</HI> attempting al&s;o by means of his Confederates to rai&s;e to &s;edition in <HI>Ni&s;mes;</HI> which the Duke having notice of, &s;ends the Lieutenant of his Guards with a command to arre&s;t him, where ever he &s;hould find him, who, after &s;ome time &s;pent in the &s;earch of him, at length arre&s;ts him in <HI>U&s;ez.</HI></P>
<P>When <HI>Ni&s;mes</HI> was thus &s;ecured, order was taken for the le|yying, and paying of a &s;ufficient number of Souldiers to pre&s;erve the Countreys about <HI>Montpellier, Ni&s;mes,</HI> and <HI>U&s;ez</HI> from the &s;poyle, and ravage, the Duke of <HI>Montmorency</HI> had orders from the King to make in tho&s;e parts, and al&s;o to &s;end &s;ome &s;upplies to <HI>Mon|tauban.</HI></P>
<P>After the holding of this A&s;&s;embly, it was thought fit that an|other &s;hould be convened in the <HI>Sevenes</HI> for the &s;ame cau&s;e; and fora&s;much as the Duke of <HI>Montmorency</HI> already began to burne, and wa&s;te the places near <HI>Montpellier, Rohan</HI> to prevent farther mi&s;chief, left <HI>Laudez</HI> his Quarterma&s;ter-General with a Brigade of hor&s;e: upon the fir&s;t approaches of <HI>Montreal</HI> Major-General to the Duke of <HI>Montmorency,</HI> at a conte&s;t about a Farme-hou&s;e, the Adjutant &s;eeing his &s;on too far engaged, goes with &s;ome Mu&s;|quetires to di&s;engage him, whereupon <HI>Montreal</HI> charges him with above an hundered hor&s;e; but <HI>Laudez</HI> came very opportunely to his re&s;cue, charged, and wounded <HI>Montreal</HI> with his own hand, made him flie, and pur&s;ued him fighting up to his own body, which was in &s;o tottering a condition, that had <HI>Saint Andre</HI> the

<P>We mu&s;t now return to the other&s;ide of the <HI>Loire,</HI> and the De|puties the Duke of <HI>Rohan</HI> had &s;ent to the Court: Tho&s;e that were de&s;irous of Peace, endeavoured to keep the King at <HI>Paris</HI> to ex|pect tho&s;e Deputies, of who&s;e &s;peedy arrival the Duke <HI>de Le&s;di|guires</HI> had given notice; for that the Chancellour, and the Pre|&s;ident <HI>Janin,</HI> who were unfit for travel, could not otherwi&s;e be pre&s;ent at the Council, nor con&s;equently be able to with&s;tand the violent motions of tho&s;e who were inclined to a prolongation of the warre, which they perceiving, omitted no inventions to with|draw the King from <HI>Paris,</HI> and on <HI>Palm-Sunday</HI> carried him by &s;tealth, out at a back gate of the <HI>Louvre,</HI> ju&s;t as if they were run|ning away with him, to keep his <HI>Ea&s;ter</HI> at <HI>Orleans;</HI> whence, with|out &s;taying for the Queen-Mother, he goes down the River as far as <HI>Nantes;</HI> the fortunate &s;ucce&s;&s;e of the Duke of <HI>Soubize</HI> obliged him to take this cour&s;e; who with two thou&s;and men, in the mid|de&s;t of all the Duke <HI>d' E&s;pernon</HI>'s forces, in <HI>Xaintonge,</HI> and <HI>Angoul|mois,</HI> of the Count <HI>de Rochefoucaults</HI> in <HI>Pictou,</HI> and <HI>Saint Lukes</HI> in the I&s;lands had &s;eized and fortified the I&s;le of <HI>Oleron,</HI> taken <HI>Royan,</HI> the Tower of <HI>Mournac, Saugeon,</HI> and &s;everal other places, totally defeated <HI>Saint Luke</HI>'s Regiment, and at noone-day forced <HI>La Chaume,</HI> and took <HI>Les Sables:</HI> In &s;hort, he &s;truck &s;o great a ter|ror into the Countrey, that had not the King's arrival prevented him, he had ab&s;olutely made him&s;elf Ma&s;ter of the field: But before the arrival of the Duke of <HI>Rohan</HI>'s Deputies, the condition of affairs in <HI>Pictou</HI> being much altered by the defeat of <HI>Riez,</HI> the retaking of <HI>Royan,</HI> and the Treaty commenced by <HI>La Force,</HI> they were remitted to the Queen-Mother, who &s;tayed at <HI>Nantes,</HI> and from thence to the Chancellour at <HI>Paris,</HI> &s;o that they returned without having effected any thing: The King keeping on his way in <HI>Guienne,</HI> concludes the Treaty with <HI>La Force,</HI> who for a Mar&s;hal of <HI>France</HI> his &s;taff, and two hundred thou&s;and crowns gave up <HI>Saint Foy,</HI> which he had injuriou&s;ly gotten, and detained from <HI>Terbon Pardaillan</HI>'s &s;on in law: And he, and his &s;ons gave up all the Of|fices, and Governments they enjoyed, without the privity of the A&s;&s;embly general or the Duke of <HI>Rohan.</HI></P>
<P>While this Treaty was in agitation, <HI>Tonneins,</HI> after a hand|&s;ome defence, was &s;urrendred to the Duke <HI>d' Elbeuf;</HI> and <HI>Lu|zignan</HI> made a particular compo&s;ition for <HI>Clerac,</HI> which he yield|ed al&s;o, &s;o that the King came to <HI>Saint Antonin</HI> without any other oppo&s;ition: The Inhabitants of <HI>Montauban,</HI> mindful of the good Offices they had received from tho&s;e of <HI>Saint Antonin,</HI> though they feared they &s;hould disfurni&s;h them&s;elves of Souldi|ers,

<P>Tho&s;e of <HI>Montauban</HI> fearing that from <HI>Saint Antonin</HI> the next vi&s;it would be to them, &s;ollicited the Duke of <HI>Rohan</HI> for a Governour, and &s;ome &s;upplies of men, who &s;ent them <HI>Saint An|dre de Montbrun,</HI> who with great courage, and equal fortune made way for him&s;elf and five Hundred Men into the Town.</P>
<P>The King's approach to the higher <HI>Languedoc</HI> greatly di&s;|heartned the whole party, and gave tho&s;e that were fal&s;e among them an occa&s;ion to renew their intelligences; Every Town in particular, &s;ent the &s;ame har&s;h me&s;&s;age to the Duke, that unle&s;s he pre&s;ently repair thither, the whole Countrey will be given up. This ca&s;t him into many anxious perplexities; for if he goes not whither he is called, the Countrey is lo&s;t; and if he does go, he leaves the lower <HI>Lauguedoc</HI> to a manife&s;t hazard, where his ab|&s;ence would give <HI>Chastillon</HI> an opportunity to revive his factions and con&s;piracies: And on the other &s;ide the Duke <HI>de Le&s;digui|eres</HI> pre&s;&s;es him with reiterated &s;ummons to a &s;econd interview: At length he re&s;olves to relieve tho&s;e that were mo&s;t nece&s;&s;itated, excu&s;es him&s;elf to <HI>Le&s;diguieres,</HI> &s;ends a renfort of Souldiers to <HI>Montpellier,</HI> to pre&s;erve their fields from ravage, by rea&s;on that the Duke of <HI>Montmorency</HI> had received a recruit of five Troops of light Hor&s;e, which <HI>Zamet</HI> brought him from the King's Army, and gives order for the levying of a thou&s;and men for the higher <HI>Languedoc;</HI> whither as he was going with his own attendants on|ly, <HI>Chauve,</HI> Mini&s;ter of the Church of <HI>Sommiers,</HI> a man of ex|emplary piety, and &s;ingular eloquence, comes to him at <HI>Saint John de Gardonnenque,</HI> and tells him that he knew, and that by very good information, that <HI>Chastillon,</HI> much di&s;plea&s;ed with him&s;elf for his former actions, was &s;ore troubled to &s;ee the im|minent ruine of tho&s;e of the Religion, whom, but for the af|fronts he had received, he had never de&s;erted; and was confi|dent,

that if he were hand&s;omely dealt with, he would return a|gain to the party; to the great advantage of it, both by rea&s;on of the con&s;ideration of his per&s;on, e&s;pecially in <HI>Languedoc,</HI> and of the con&s;equence of the Town of <HI>Aiguemortes,</HI> which was in his hands. This was a device of <HI>Cha&s;tillon</HI>'s confederates, who, knowing the reputation of this Mini&s;ter, had abu&s;ed him with the&s;e hopes, that the Dukes refu&s;al to admit of him, might fur|ni&s;h them with more &s;pecious pretences on which to ground their detractions and new calumnies again&s;t him; which the Duke very well fore&s;eeing, an&s;wers, That he was &s;o farre from diver|ting his good intentions, or hindring a work of &s;o general con|cernment, as the regaining &s;uch a per&s;on to their party, that, on the contrary, in any thing tending to their advantage, he would meet him more than half way: As for the command con|ferred on him, by rea&s;on of the other's ab&s;enting him&s;elf from the Province, as he had never &s;ued for it, &s;o neither was he &s;o fond of it, as not to yield it up, whenever the Province that gave it him &s;hould think fit to revoke it; and that he wi&s;hed with all his heart, that he would &s;eriou&s;ly and in good earne&s;t, comply with his duty to his own, and the publick Intere&s;ts; that for his part, he was contented with the command a&s;&s;igned him by the general A&s;&s;embly at <HI>Rochell,</HI> in the upper <HI>Guienne,</HI> and the upper <HI>Languedoc,</HI> whither he was now going to provide a|gain&s;t the dangers the King's approach gave them cau&s;e to feare, leaving the way open for <HI>Cha&s;tillon</HI> to return to tho&s;e he had be|fore for&s;aken: However the duty he owed both to his imploy|ment, and con&s;cience, obliged him to &s;ay, that there were yet many things in this ca&s;e to be con&s;idered, and that the Province ought maturely to weigh, and every one in particular &s;trictly to examine the importance and con&s;equences of this affair, and principally <HI>Chauve</HI> him&s;elf, both by rea&s;on of his profe&s;&s;ion, and the charge he had now undertaken: But that the infallible tryal of his &s;incerity would be, whether he would effectively deliver up into the hands of the Province, the Town of <HI>Aiguemortes;</HI> for that if his pretences to &s;erve the party were real and &s;incere, he would make no difficulty of it, but if feigned and fallacious, he would never di&s;-po&s;&s;e&s;&s;e him&s;elf of it: <HI>Chauve</HI> very well approved the motion, believing he would accept of it; and &s;o re|turned.</P>
<P>The Duke fore&s;eeing that in his ab&s;ence this bu&s;ine&s;s would be moved again, gave an e&s;pecial charge to <HI>Dupuy</HI> (whom he left his Agent in that Province) to take great heed, that nothing pa&s;|&s;ed there, to the prejudice of the publick or his Intere&s;t; to which end he gave him &s;ufficient power, and in&s;tructions, ten|ding,

chiefly to this, that if this propo&s;ition were &s;tarted in any A&s;&s;embly what&s;oever, and that they &s;hould proceed to Treat on it with out the precedent condition, to wit, that the Gari&s;on of <HI>Aiguemortes</HI> &s;hould be fir&s;t re&s;tored to the di&s;po&s;al of the Pro|vince, he &s;hould oppo&s;e it; and if they Treated on tho&s;e termes, he &s;hould &s;ee that there were no foul play u&s;ed, and that nothing were concluded without a previous performance of that con|dition.</P>
<P>This done, he proceeds in his journey to the higher <HI>Langue|doc,</HI> and arrives there ju&s;t upon the taking of <HI>Saint Antonin,</HI> and &s;o opportunely, that he prevented the Rendition of <HI>Lombez</HI> and <HI>Realmont,</HI> and revives the drooping and almo&s;t decayed &s;pirits of the whole Countrey, in which he lo&s;t nothing but <HI>Carmaing, Saint Espuel,</HI> and <HI>Cuc&abque;</HI> the fir&s;t by treachery the other two by rea&s;on of their weakne&s;s were quitted by the inhabitants, and afterwards fired, as the Army marched by.</P>

In the mean while came the Deputies from the A&s;&s;embly of the Pro|vince of the <HI>Sevenes,</HI> who made a large Remon&s;trance of the injuries their Province would receive from the change they would introduce in their proceedings, that it was an unheard of proce|dure, and that their Province could never &s;uffer, that that of <HI>Languedoc,</HI> &s;hould by it &s;elf pre&s;ume to abrogate the Decrees of the A&s;&s;embly of the Circle, or five Provinces, in which the De|puties of the A&s;&s;embly of the <HI>Sevenes</HI> had a joynt concurrence of Votes with tho&s;e of the lower <HI>Languedoc;</HI> and moreover repre|&s;ented to the A&s;&s;embly their own Intere&s;ts, and the inconveni|ences would en&s;ue their &s;ubmitting them&s;elves to the power and conduct of a man, whom they had &s;o highly provoked, by the &s;u&s;picions they had of him; and in the la&s;t place prote&s;ted, That in ca&s;e the A&s;&s;embly &s;hould proceed further, in the ab&s;ence of the Duke of <HI>Rohan,</HI> or without his con&s;ent and approbation, they would ab&s;olutely di&s;claim them.</P>
<P>This oppo&s;ition of the Deputies of the Council of the <HI>Sevenes,</HI> &s;econded by tho&s;e of the three Towns, grounded upon their own, and the large Commi&s;&s;ion, and power of <HI>Dupuy</HI> &s;omething cool|ed the heat of tho&s;e &s;ollicitours, which yet in a &s;hort time after they re&s;umed again; and importuned <HI>Chauve</HI> anew, to pro&s;ecute what he had begun; which he would by no means undertake, without imparting it to <HI>Dupuy;</HI> who after he had remembred him, upon what terms he had parted with the Duke of <HI>Rohan</HI> at <HI>Saint John de Gardonnenque,</HI> tells him that he would con&s;ider of it, and then give him his an&s;wer; and in the mean time had a con|ference about it with the Deputies of the three Towns, who thought

it not unfit that <HI>Chauve,</HI> as of him&s;elf, and without any particular Commi&s;&s;ion, &s;hould &s;ound <HI>Cha&s;tillon</HI>'s inclinations, to di&s;cover whether he would yield to that condition of delivering up <HI>Aigue|mortes</HI> into the hands of the Province, which was then very op|portunely met, to receive both it, and him, with all a&s;&s;urance he could de&s;ire of an Amne&s;ty, and the continuance of their re&s;pects to him: It being mo&s;t apparant, that <HI>Cha&s;tillon,</HI> who they knew de&s;ired nothing more than to intrude him&s;elf among us, only to render him&s;elf more con&s;iderable, and his Intere&s;ts more favou|red at Court, would never disfurni&s;h him&s;elf of the only means left him, to procure a performance of the promi&s;es made him, and that thus they &s;hould al&s;o make him de&s;i&s;t from his pur&s;uit. When they had given <HI>Chauve</HI> their an&s;wer in the&s;e termes, he approved of it; and promi&s;ed to comport him&s;elf according to their directions; and thereupon had a conference with <HI>Ban&s;illon</HI> the Mini&s;ter of <HI>Aiguemortes,</HI> who highly magnified the advanta|ges this re-e&s;tabli&s;hment of <HI>Cha&s;tillon</HI> would produce to their par|ty in general: To whom <HI>Chauve</HI> replyed, That it would be im|po&s;&s;ible to efface the impre&s;&s;ions <HI>Chastillon</HI>'s procedures had left in the whole Province, unle&s;s he &s;upplied them with the means he had in his hands, by yielding up the Town of <HI>Aiguemortes</HI> to their di&s;po&s;al; which if he would do, they would evidence the con|tentment they had, to &s;ee a per&s;on of his quality return into the way from which he had digre&s;&s;ed, by their promptne&s;s to &s;erve and honour him, as they had formerly done: This di&s;cour&s;e plea&s;ed not <HI>Ban&s;illon</HI> at all, who told him, that he conceived that <HI>Cha|stillon</HI> neither would, nor ought to con&s;ent to this Propo&s;ition; that he had good rea&s;on to take heed of falling into tho&s;e &s;nares he knew were &s;pread for him; for that having deve&s;ted him of all power, they might the more ea&s;ily di&s;po&s;e of him at their plea&s;ure, or at lea&s;t pay all his former &s;ervice with the cold re|compence of Oblivion, or neglect; and that therefore he con|ceived the Treaty ab&s;olutely broken: Upon which, as <HI>Chauve</HI> was about to leave him, he told him, that he would give <HI>Chastillon</HI> an account of all, and him an an&s;wer the next day at the &s;ame place; which he did, and in effect conformable to his own pre|conceptions; which ab&s;olutely cleared the judgement of <HI>Chauve,</HI> and many others al&s;o, when he had given the A&s;&s;embly a Summary of this conference.</P>
<P>In the mean while the Deputies of the three Towns ince&s;&s;ant|ly &s;ollicited <HI>Dupuy,</HI> to pre&s;s the Duke of <HI>Rohan</HI>'s return, repre|&s;enting to him the condition of the Province, and the danger it was in of being ruined by the divi&s;ions &s;prung from this late Pro|po&s;ition, and the delay his ab&s;ence occa&s;ioned in the progre&s;s of
<PB N="83" REF="46">
their affaires: Whereupon <HI>Dupuy</HI> re&s;olved, to make a journey him&s;elf to the Duke of <HI>Rohan:</HI> But yet he would not leave the A&s;&s;embly, before he had gotten a promi&s;e from <HI>Berticheres,</HI> that there &s;hould be no more mention made of the afore&s;aid re-e&s;ta|bli&s;hment for eight dayes, by which time he &s;hould return a|gain from <HI>Ni&s;mes</HI> whither he pretended he was going; but in the mean time he goes by great journeys towards the Duke, whom he found at <HI>Pont de Camares,</HI> who having received from him an account of all pa&s;&s;ages, quitted all other things to return with all po&s;&s;ible &s;peed to the lower <HI>Languedoc:</HI> When he was come to <HI>Mirveis,</HI> he &s;ent a Gentleman, with command to travel night and day to the A&s;&s;embly, to let them know that he was within two days journey of them, and de&s;ired them to &s;u&s;pend all further de|bates concerning their affairs, till his arrival.</P>
<P>This unexpected news &s;urprized the A&s;&s;embly &s;o, that in|&s;tead of continuing their con&s;ultations, they went to meet him as farre as <HI>Sommieres,</HI> where when he had learned of them, what or|der they had taken for the rai&s;ing of Souldiers, and &s;upplying the Gari&s;ons with nece&s;&s;aries, he ratified what they had done, and &s;o di&s;mi&s;&s;ed them.</P>
<P>Thus ended this tentative of <HI>Chastillon's</HI> friends to re&s;tore him to a repute with the Party: After which <HI>Rohan</HI> went to <HI>Montpellier,</HI> where he turned fifteen or &s;ixteen of his chiefe&s;t Con|fidents out of the Town, and ordered all things nece&s;&s;ary (as before he had done at <HI>Montauban</HI>) for a &s;iege, both for ammunition, victu|als, and the fortifications.</P>
<P>It is to be ob&s;erved, that in the Duke's ab&s;ence, <HI>Americ</HI> the fir&s;t Con&s;ul of <HI>Montpellier,</HI> and <HI>Carlincas</HI> his Kin&s;man, took oc|ca&s;ion upon a defeat of two or three companies, near to <HI>Perolles,</HI> which <HI>Saint Andr&eacute;</HI> had &s;ent thither, while the enemy was plun|dering the Countrey thereabouts, to accu&s;e him to the people, who had already a jealou&s;ie of him; and <HI>Berticheres,</HI> thoug his father-in-law, in&s;tead of a&s;&s;i&s;ting him, helped to thru&s;t him out of the Town; not out of any affection to the cau&s;e, but of a pe|&s;tilent ambition raigned among them; every one labouring to rai&s;e his own advantages upon the ruines of others, and better their conditions by delivering <HI>Montpellier</HI> to the King: But the &s;eventeen dayes &s;tay the Duke made there, and the di&s;covery he made, by a Me&s;&s;enger of the Pre&s;ident <HI>Faure,</HI> taken neare <HI>Ni&s;mes,</HI> that <HI>Berticheres</HI> Treated with the King, together with &s;ome Colonels, who were ordered for the defence of <HI>Montpel|lier;</HI> and the execution of <HI>Bimart,</HI> who was one of them, reduced things to a better po&s;ture; But yet the&s;e di&s;orders re|tarded the Levyes, &s;o that of foure thou&s;and Souldiers de&s;ign|ed
<PB N="84" REF="47">
for the defence of the Town, they got in but fifteen hundred.</P>
<P>It is moreover to be noted, that the Duke of <HI>Rohan</HI> &s;eeing the great want of Ammunition in the Province of lower <HI>Langue|doc,</HI> and of time, and means to fortifie all their Gari&s;ons, pro|po&s;ed the di&s;mantling of them, and the reducing of their forces to <HI>Montpellier, Ni&s;mes, U&s;ez,</HI> and <HI>Sommieres;</HI> which the people then rejected, but have &s;ince, though too late, repented it; for their ob&s;tinacy drew upon them the lo&s;s both of their E&s;tates and Liberties; for whiles they vainly trifled away their time and la|bour, in fortifying &s;o many places, neither of them was fortified or defended as it ought, but both they, and the reliefs &s;ent to them, which in the other places would have been of great u&s;e, were now made wholly un&s;erviceable.</P>
<P>The King &s;eeing that the care and diligence of the Duke of <HI>Rohan</HI> had defeated all the de&s;ignes of tho&s;e that would have deli|vered up <HI>Montpellier</HI> to him, &s;taid &s;ome time at <HI>Beziers</HI> to ex|pect his Ammunitions, and to recruit his Army: And in the mean time &s;ent the Mar&s;hal <HI>de Pra&s;lin</HI> to be&s;iege <HI>Bedarieux,</HI> which he took, and di&s;mantled; and then &s;ent the Duke of <HI>Mont|morency</HI> to take in <HI>Mauguio,</HI> which the inhabitants knew not how to defend, nor yet would they quit it, nor &s;poyle the wines, as the Duke of <HI>Rohan</HI> had commanded them.</P>
<P>The Prince of <HI>Cond&eacute;</HI> about this time came to the King's Ar|my, and thence went to be&s;iege <HI>Lunel</HI> and <HI>Ma&s;&s;illargues,</HI> within half a League one of another, and &s;ufficiently &s;tored with all nece&s;&s;aries, there being in <HI>Lunel</HI> two Colonels be&s;ides the Go|vernour, who all joyntly wrote to the Duke of <HI>Rohan,</HI> that if he would &s;end them in but five hundred Souldiers, they would give a hand&s;ome account of the place: The Duke, when he had &s;et|led <HI>Calonges</HI> in <HI>Montpellier,</HI> and left <HI>Dupuy</HI> his Agent there, in his name to provide all things requi&s;ite for the defence of the Town, went purpo&s;ely to prepare the de&s;ired &s;upply, and &s;ent them in eight hundred men; but much to their regret; for the next day, though they had not &s;uffered any the lea&s;t extremity, and that the breach made was not con&s;iderable, they yielded them&s;elves with all their Arms, and Baggage. Tho&s;e of <HI>Ma&s;&s;il|largues</HI> had done the like but a few dayes before: But the Arti|cles of <HI>Lunel</HI> were violated even before the Prince of <HI>Conde</HI>'s face; for when the Gari&s;on marched out, they were beaten, di&s;|armed, &s;tript, and a great part of them killed or maimed; and in this lamentable po&s;ture went they to <HI>Ni&s;mes</HI> and <HI>Sommieres,</HI> on which they brought &s;o great a terror, that upon the appearance of the enemy before <HI>Sommieres,</HI> in which there were fifteen hun|dred
<PB N="85" REF="47">
men, they did even as bad as tho&s;e of <HI>Lunel;</HI> and, which is a mo&s;t &s;hameful thing to be related, the Captains took two thou|&s;and Crowns, to leave their arms to the enemy.</P>
<P>The Town of <HI>Ni&s;mes</HI> alarmed by the&s;e &s;ad accidents, &s;ent Me&s;&s;engers to reque&s;t a vi&s;it from the Duke of <HI>Rohan,</HI> which he willingly conde&s;cended to, but fir&s;t got together as many Souldi|ers as he could at <HI>Anduze,</HI> which he left under the Command of <HI>Charce</HI> his Lieutenant General in the <HI>Sevenes,</HI> and of the Adju|tant General, who when they &s;aw the Duke of <HI>Montmorency</HI> re|turn to the <HI>Sevenes,</HI> drew into a body about a quarter of a League from <HI>Anduze,</HI> at a Pa&s;s not ea&s;ily acce&s;&s;ible, which they fortifi|ed; and had not their care and diligence in furni&s;hing <HI>Sauve</HI> and <HI>Aletz</HI> with two valiant and expert Commanders, and a thou|&s;and, or twelve hundred Souldiers, drawn out of <HI>Saint Hyppo|lite,</HI> and the places adjacent prevented it, tho&s;e two Towns had been al&s;o lo&s;t: So that the good po&s;ture they were in, toge|ther with the Duke of <HI>Rohan</HI>'s ob&s;tructing of <HI>Montmorency</HI>'s pro|vi&s;ions, which came a great way off, forced him, after a &s;ucce&s;&s;e|le&s;s voyage, to return again.</P>
<P>In the mean time the Mar&s;hal <HI>Themines</HI> plundred all the Coun|trey about <HI>Montauban,</HI> burnt all their Countrey hou&s;es, and ob|&s;tructed their Vintage: But all this hindred not <HI>Saint Andre de Montbrun,</HI> their Governour, from drawing out his Canon, and battering, and taking many Ca&s;tles, among others, <HI>Reni&eacute;,</HI> and <HI>la Bastide,</HI> and &s;toring his Town with Corne and Wine for a whole yeare: He had al&s;o &s;everal Skirmi&s;hes with the Gari|&s;on of <HI>Montech,</HI> and others al&s;o, and &s;till came off with honour and advantage.</P>
<P>The Duke of <HI>Vendo&s;me</HI> al&s;o with &s;even thou&s;and Foot, and five hundred Hor&s;e, &s;ate down before <HI>Lombez; Malauze</HI> comes to <HI>Realmont</HI> with intention to relieve it; but conceiving it not te|nable again&s;t &s;uch a force, by rea&s;on of the weakne&s;s of the Town, and that the Ca&s;tle which commanded it, was Gari&s;on'd by the enemy; contented him&s;elf after a long Skirmi&s;h, with|drawing off the Souldiers, as well inhabitants, as &s;trangers; and abandons the town, which was burnt. From <HI>Lombez</HI> the Duke marches to be&s;iege <HI>Brite&s;te,</HI> a little place, weak of it &s;elf, and commanded almo&s;t on every &s;ide: Thither <HI>Malauze</HI> &s;ent five hundred men under the Command of <HI>Faucon,</HI> one of <HI>Se&s;igny</HI>'s Captains, who behaved him&s;elf very gallantly: He endured the Siege a month or more, beat them off in four or five a&s;&s;aults, was twice relieved with fre&s;h &s;upplies of men and powder; by <HI>Malauze,</HI> who&s;e main body lay at <HI>Saint Paul</HI> and <HI>Miatte,</HI> a|bout a League and half from <HI>Brite&s;te,</HI> and never had more than
<PB N="86" REF="48">
two thou&s;and Foot, and two hundred Voluntiers on Hor&s;e-back, with whom, and by the means of the brave re&s;i&s;tance of the be|&s;ieged, he did &s;o well, that the Duke of <HI>Vendo&s;me,</HI> being com|manded by the King to come, and joyn his Porces with the Army that lay before <HI>Montpellier,</HI> rai&s;ed the &s;iege after he had &s;pent two thou&s;and Canon bullets on them, and lo&s;t fifteen hun|dred of his men; and tho&s;e within the town three hun|dred.</P>
<P>The departure of this Army, freed the whole Country from much harm, and greater fears; and invites us to return to the lover <HI>Languedoc,</HI> where the Duke <HI>de Le&s;diguieres,</HI> having exchanged his Religion for the honour to be made Con&s;table of <HI>France,</HI> conceiving him&s;elf more capable now, than heretofore, to procure a Peace, &s;ollicites the Duke of <HI>Rohan</HI> to another in|terview, who &s;eeing the hopes he had grounded on the Count <HI>Mansfield,</HI> who was gone into <HI>Holland,</HI> had failed him, the more willingly complies with his de&s;ires. They met at <HI>Saint Pri|vas,</HI> where they agreed on all things, except the King's entry into <HI>Montpellier;</HI> whereupon he obliged the Duke to a journey to the Town, to propo&s;e it to them, with all po&s;&s;ible a&s;&s;urances, they &s;hould de&s;ire, to te&s;tifie, that they intended not the lea&s;t in|fringement of their liberties: But this to be done without any ce&s;&s;ation of Arms, nor was the Duke allowed more than two dayes &s;tay there, to perfect this negotiation; who, con&s;idering the danger <HI>Montpellier</HI> was in, unle&s;s &s;upplied with a new renfort of Souldiers; for that the works being not fini&s;hed, their defects were to be made up with an addition of more men, &s;ends expre&s;s Orders to his Adjutant General <HI>Sorle,</HI> to draw twelve hundred men, out of the two thou&s;and he had with much adoe detained at <HI>Anduze,</HI> and by the Valley of <HI>Montferrant</HI> conduct them to <HI>Mont|pellier,</HI> the night en&s;uing the evening that he &s;hould get in there: But when the Captains and Souldiers knew that they were to be &s;ocked up in <HI>Montpellier,</HI> they all de&s;erted the Adjutant, who came thither accompanied only with fifteen.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e of <HI>Montpellier</HI> would by no means admit of the Propo|&s;ition concerning the King's entry into their Town, fearing a &s;up|pre&s;&s;ion of their liberties, by rea&s;on of the Prince of <HI>Conde</HI>'s ani|mo&s;ities again&s;t them; which the Duke perceiving, encourages them to &s;tand bravely upon their defence, a&s;&s;uring them that he would provide for their relief, in which, for his part, he omitted nothing that might forward it: But as there is a va&s;t difference between the promi&s;es, and payment of money, &s;o in&s;tead of ten days, within which time he thought to have &s;ent them aid, not|with&s;tanding his journeys to <HI>Ni&s;mes, U&s;ez,</HI> and the <HI>Sevenes,</HI> not

without manife&s;t hazard of his per&s;on, could he not, under five weeks, get four thou&s;and men together; nor tho&s;e neither with|out engaging him&s;elf by promi&s;es to mo&s;t of the Captains; that they were not to be &s;ent to <HI>Montpellier,</HI> but only that the con|&s;ideration of their numbers might procure them a more advan|tageous Peace: So great was their con&s;ternation; and tho&s;e that were de&s;irous to get thither, were yet deterred by the ap|prehen&s;ion of the difficulties, which really were very great; the King having then an Army con&s;i&s;ting of twenty thou&s;and Foot, and three thou&s;and Hor&s;e; for the Con&s;table, and the Duke of <HI>Vendo&s;me</HI> had now joyned their's with the other Forces; be&s;ides, &s;o great a way were they to go, and &s;uch difficult pa&s;|&s;es had they to get through, that it was impo&s;&s;ible to approach within three Leagues of the Town, without encountring the King's whole Cavalry; and moreover &s;o great a &s;carcity was there of Provii&s;ions, that they could not keep the Troops together, more than eight or ten dayes: Tho&s;e of <HI>Montpellier</HI> of the other &s;ide, could no longer &s;ub&s;i&s;t for want of men, by rea&s;on of the exce&s;&s;ive duty they were on, and therefore every moment &s;ent they mo&s;t important Letters for relief: To which may be added al&s;o a new Summons &s;ent him by the Con&s;table, who had before left the Court in &s;ome di&s;content for that he could not prevaile to obtain a Peace; yet now at his return was he in higher e|&s;teem, both by rea&s;on of the Forces he had brought with him, and that the Prince, in his ab&s;ence, had nothing advanced the Siege: All which the Duke con&s;idering, and that he was utterly de&s;titute of hopes of any Forraign a&s;&s;i&s;tance, having newly re|ceived a Letter from the King of <HI>England</HI> pre&s;&s;ing him to con|clude a Peace, and &s;eeing no probability of any good to be done at home; every one being weary of the War, and labouring to purcha&s;e his own particular &s;afety, with the expence of the pub|lick Intere&s;t; that the fir&s;t Town &s;hould fall off, and embrace a particular Treaty, would totally fru&s;trate all endeavours for a ge|neral Peace; that the lea&s;t cro&s;s accident &s;hould happen to <HI>Mont|pellier,</HI> or the relief intended for it, would be irreparable; that the King could not want men, the Duke of <HI>Angoule&s;me</HI> being then at <HI>Lions</HI> with a recruit of eight, or ten thou&s;and; and that, without a miracle, <HI>Montpellier</HI> could not be pre&s;erved: More|over, &s;eeing that there were about the King two powerful par|ties; the one pre&s;&s;ing the conclu&s;ion of a Peace, the other, the continuation of the War; and that the former could not &s;ub&s;i&s;t without a Peace, no more than the other without a War; and that the Chief of the latter, to wit, the Prince of <HI>Conde</HI> had de&s;erted the Court upon the Compo&s;ure of former differences,

<P>_THe Peace thus concluded, the Prince gone from the Court, and his Faction, by his ab&s;ence, and the death of the Cardinal <HI>de Retz</HI> quite de|cayed, every one began to have fair hopes of its continuance, and that, grown wi&s;e by our former mi&s;carriages, we &s;hould now renounce all future thoughts of Civil broyles, and mind the Protection of the ancient Allyes of the Crown: But the beams of favour now reflecting &s;olely on <HI>Puizieux,</HI> a man of a hot &s;pirit, and who&s;e whole ingenuity con&s;i&s;ted in tricks and fallacies, he be|came more &s;tudious of his own, than his Ma&s;ters geatne&s;&s;e (a vice incident to all favourites) being carefull to rai&s;e him&s;elf &s;ome props at <HI>Rome,</HI> and very unwilling to give <HI>Spaine</HI> the lea&s;t di&s;gu&s;t;

So that all Leagues with other forraigne Princes, were made with &s;uch re&s;pect to tho&s;e two powers, as if we &s;tood in fear of their di&s;plea&s;ure: Nay, and to &s;ooth the Popes <HI>Nuncio,</HI> who had al|wayes oppo&s;ed the Peace, at the very beginning of it, would un|dertake to &s;hew him, that it was not made to abate the pre&s;ecuti|on, but to promote the ruine of tho&s;e of the Reformed Religion. For immediately after the King's entry into <HI>Montpellier,</HI> the &s;en&s;e of the general Grant was inverted in mo&s;t places of it, notwith|&s;tanding the &s;everal Remon&s;trances the Duke of <HI>Rohan</HI> made to oppo&s;e it: Nor were the Souldiers drawn away from <HI>Montpellier,</HI> though promi&s;ed to be done immediately after the King's depar|ture; then was it put off, till his return from <HI>Provence,</HI> then, till he came to <HI>Avignon,</HI> and la&s;tly till he &s;hould be at <HI>Lions;</HI> whence the Duke of <HI>Rohan</HI> having followed him to all tho&s;e places, urg|ing their departure very earne&s;tly, and perhaps too boldly, telling the King they &s;hould de&s;i&s;t from farther razing the fortifications, if he revoked that command, returned with a Letter to <HI>Valence,</HI> commanding him expre&s;ly to do it. Nor did they forbear in their march through <HI>Dauphine</HI> to &s;eize upon all the places that were in the hands of tho&s;e of the Religion, though they had &s;erved the Kings party, the only recompence they had for fighting again&s;t their con&s;ciences, nor were any but tho&s;e only, that were po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the Con&s;table, exempt from this violence, which yet he pre|&s;erved with much difficulty, for had not the Mar&s;hal <HI>Crequi</HI> en|gaged to deliver them up after his death, they had then gone the &s;ame way with the re&s;t. At <HI>Lions</HI> the Deputies of <HI>Rochelle</HI> came to wait upon the King, whence they carried back Letters to <HI>Arnaud</HI> Governour of <HI>Fort Lewis,</HI> commanding him, that within eight dayes after the <HI>Rochellers</HI> had performed what the Articles had en|joyned them, as concerning the demolition of their fortifications, he &s;hould cau&s;e the &s;aid Fort to be &s;lighted al&s;o: but <HI>Arnaud</HI> re|ceived another of the &s;ame date, but a cleare contrary &s;ence.</P>
<P>When the King went from <HI>Lions,</HI> towards <HI>Paris,</HI> the Duke of <HI>Rohan</HI> returned to <HI>Languedoc,</HI> really and &s;incerely to execute, what ever had been promi&s;ed in the name of tho&s;e of the Religion, touching that part of their fortifications they ought to &s;light. Go|ing to <HI>Montpellier,</HI> he found the Con&s;ulate of the Merchants changed, of which he complains to the Court, but in vaine: He delivers the Kings Letter to <HI>Valence,</HI> who promi&s;ed to obey it; from thence he goes to <HI>Ni&s;mes</HI> and <HI>U&s;ez,</HI> whom he pre&s;ently &s;ets on work; thence to the higher <HI>Languedoc, Montauban, Foix,</HI> and <HI>Ro&uuml;ergue,</HI> where at a conference with the Duke of <HI>Ventadour,</HI> the Count of <HI>Carmaine,</HI> the Pre&s;ident <HI>de Caminade,</HI> and the Count

<P>Notwith&s;tanding all which <HI>Valence,</HI> who, be&s;ides the four thou|&s;and men were in <HI>Montpellier,</HI> had four or five Regiments more, and three or four troops of light hor&s;e, had de&s;igned to &s;urprize, with the&s;e the <HI>Sevenes</HI> under pretence of taking up quarters there, and by means of &s;ome corre&s;pondencies he had gotten among them; of which when the Duke had notice, from the principal Communalties of the <HI>Sevenes,</HI> who &s;ent him their complaints of this infringement of the Peace, he wrote to them back again for an&s;wer, that he knew it was not the Kings plea&s;ure, and there|fore that they &s;hould not receive them; and to <HI>Valenc&eacute;</HI> that he &s;hould forbear tho&s;e quarters till his arrival, lea&s;t otherwi&s;e it &s;hould prejudice the e&s;tabli&s;hment of the Peace: The Duke of <HI>Ventadour,</HI> the Count <HI>de Carmaine,</HI> and the Pre&s;ident <HI>de Caminade</HI> wrote to him to the &s;ame effect; which he regarded not, but proceeded in his enterpri&s;e, the Towns of <HI>Sauve,</HI> and <HI>Gange</HI> re|ceiving his Troops, but all the other places, upon the Duke of <HI>Ro|han</HI>'s Letter refu&s;ed them: The Duke when he had put things in &s;uch a forwardne&s;&s;e in the higher <HI>Languedoc,</HI> returns to <HI>Montpel|lier</HI> according to the agreement between him, and <HI>Valenc&eacute;:</HI> But he was no &s;ooner entred the Town, than made a Pri&s;oner, and kept with a &s;evere guard upon him: This cau&s;ed a great a&s;toni&s;h|ment in many, who could not imagine that this &s;hould be done without order; but being known at Court, it was not approved of there, for fear le&s;t it &s;hould prove too great an ob&s;truction to the rai&s;ing of the fortifications; &s;o that his liberty was pre&s;ently ordered.</P>
<P>Whiles the Duke was under this re&s;traint, <HI>Valence,</HI> contrary to the Articles of the Peace, divides the Con&s;ulate of <HI>Montpellier</HI> between tho&s;e of the Religion and the Papi&s;ts, and to effect it, u&s;ed all manner of violence to the old Con&s;uls, detaining them as pri&s;oners one whole night in his own lodgings.</P>
<P>The Court gave the Duke of <HI>Rohan</HI> no better &s;atisfaction con|cerning this, than the former breach of the Peace; receiving, in|&s;tead of relief, advice, that to avoid the &s;u&s;pitions the lower <HI>Lan|guedoc</HI> had of him, he &s;hould remove to the higher, to execute the remaining part of his Commi&s;&s;ion: For <HI>Puy&s;ieux</HI> brother-in-law to <HI>Valenc&eacute;,</HI> having ca&s;hiered <HI>Schomberg,</HI> and re&s;tored the Chancellour his Father, was now the only powerful man, and by

<P>When he came to <HI>Millaud</HI> he was informed, that the Duke <HI>d' Espernou</HI> had written to all the Towns held by tho&s;e of the Re|ligion in <HI>Ro&uuml;ergue,</HI> to &s;end him Deputies both of the one, and the other Religion, and that they &s;hould not proceed to the Election of their Con&s;uls, (who are u&s;ually cho&s;en at <HI>Whit&s;untide</HI>) before they had from him known the King's plea&s;ure therein; this cau&s;ed a great confu&s;ion among them; but by the advice of the Duke of <HI>Rohan</HI> they proceed, notwith&s;tanding, to their Elections, at the accu&s;tomed time, according to the Declaration of Peace, which imports, that in the Con&s;ulary Towns, held by tho&s;e of the Re|ligion, nothing &s;hall be innovated; and then &s;ent their Deputies to the Duke <HI>d' Espernon</HI> to know what his plea&s;ure was: Avoiding by this means, the injury intended to the Peace, and them in this particular.</P>
<P>This done, he goes to <HI>Ca&s;tres,</HI> where he fixes his re&s;idence, and thence &s;ends the King a perfect account of the entire execution of his Commi&s;&s;ion; humbly be&s;eeching him, that, according to his Royal promi&s;e, the di&s;garri&s;oning of <HI>Montpellier,</HI> the demolition of the Fort <HI>Lewis,</HI> and the re-e&s;tabli&s;hing of the Chamber (or Court erected in favour of tho&s;e of the Reformed Religion) at <HI>Ca&s;tres,</HI> might be no longer deferred: But in&s;tead of receiving Ju&s;tice thereupon, contrary to the Act of Pacification, verified in &s;everal Parliaments, without any re&s;trictions, or limitations, the engage|ments given underhand and Seale, re-iterated by &s;everal Letters, the An&s;wer given to the Propo&s;itions of the Deputies general, and his Maje&s;ties an&s;wers to the Committee of the Parliament of <HI>Thoulouze,</HI> concerning the Chamber of <HI>Ca&s;tres,</HI> the Garri&s;on in <HI>Montpellier</HI> was continued, and a Cittadel al&s;o was erected there, the Fort <HI>Lewis</HI> was re-fortified, and the Chamber was removed to <HI>Bezers:</HI> But this was not all; The Tembles, or Churches of tho&s;e

The Duke of <HI>Rohan</HI> continues his &s;ollicitations at Court; and declared his mind &s;o freely, that he was forbid any farther to mention of their affairs, it being the King's plea&s;ure that they thould addre&s;&s;e them&s;elves to the Deputies general, who al&s;o promi&s;ed with all &s;peed po&s;&s;ible to &s;end Commi&s;&s;ioners into the Provinces to put the Edict in execution, and redre&s;&s;e all their grievances.</P>
<P>In the mean while the Galleys remained &s;till at <HI>Bourdeaux,</HI> and the Duke of <HI>Gui&s;e</HI> came up with his Ships to the I&s;le of <HI>Re,</HI> which gave a great alarm to <HI>Rochelle,</HI> and made the Duke of <HI>Soubize,</HI> and the Count <HI>de Laval,</HI> to retire al&s;o to the Town: But this fear was quickly over; the Duke withdrawing thence, and &s;ayling with his Ships towards <HI>Mar&s;eilles,</HI> followed by the Galleys, who&s;e ab&s;ence had much prejudiced the trade of <HI>Provence,</HI> imboldning the Pyrates &s;o, that they took and carried away their Merchandi|zes even in &s;ight of <HI>Mar&s;eilles.</HI> But the King di&s;covering much di&s;plea&s;ure again&s;t tho&s;e that fled in to <HI>Rochelle,</HI> the Count <HI>de La|val,</HI> went to make his Apology at Court: But the Duke of <HI>Sou|hize,</HI> conceiving that way not honorable for him; and that his abode in <HI>Poictou,</HI> or <HI>Britany,</HI> could not be with any &s;ecurity, goes directly to <HI>Ca&s;tres.</HI></P>

the acceptance of the Articles of Peace touching the affair of the <HI>Valteline,</HI> by the Commander <HI>de Sillery</HI> Emba&s;&s;adour at <HI>Rome,</HI> and brother to the Chancellour, was occa&s;ioned by in&s;tructions, which he (unknown to the King) had received from <HI>France,</HI> to that purpo&s;e: Whereupon the King, as ea&s;ie to believe the wor&s;t, as hard to believe the be&s;t of any one, re&s;olves to de|prive them of their Offices, and gives the Seals to <HI>Alligre</HI> Coun|&s;ellour of State, and <HI>Pui&s;ieux</HI> his Office of Secretary of State, was &s;hared among his other companions; and <HI>Vieuville</HI> remain|ed the only Favourite; who to improve their di&s;grace to his fur|ther advantage, cau&s;ed all the Emba&s;&s;adours to be changed, placing creatures of his own in their rooms; and had like to have framed a Criminal Proce&s;s again&s;t the Chancellour; who in a lit|tle while after dyed of grief and age; and the Keeper of the Seals was promoted to his place.</P>
<P>After this, the new Favourite, changing the former Max|imes, that he might the better di&s;cover the male-admini&s;trations, of tho&s;e who&s;e di&s;grace he had procured, cau&s;ed the Treaty of the <HI>Valteline</HI> to be di&s;owned; obtaines another more advantage|ous to the State; &s;ets on foot the Marriage of <HI>Madame</HI> the King's Si&s;ter, with the King of <HI>England;</HI> renews the Leagues for the recovery of the <HI>Valteline,</HI> and re&s;cuing it from the oppre&s;&s;ion of the <HI>Germanes:</HI> To which end <HI>Bethune</HI> was &s;ent Emba&s;&s;adour ex|traordinary to <HI>Rome;</HI> the Marque&s;s <HI>de Coeuvres</HI> to the <HI>Valte|line; Mansfield</HI> into <HI>Germany</HI> with con&s;iderable Forces; and the Con&s;table with the Duke of <HI>Savoy</HI> again&s;t the <HI>Genoe&s;es.</HI> This di&s;po&s;ition of affairs gave fair hopes of great matters, which indeed had very pro&s;perous beginnings.</P>
<P>And that there might be a good &s;tock of money to carry on the Warres, an Inqui&s;ition into the <HI>Financiers</HI> was thought very expedient. And becau&s;e <HI>Beaumarchais Vieuville</HI>'s Father-in-law was the chiefe&s;t, and wealthie&s;t among them, they re&s;olved to di&s;grace him fir&s;t: And in order to it, fir&s;t of all they &s;cattered little Pa&s;quils again&s;t him; afterwards they dealt more boldly, and plainly with him, and every one, progno&s;ticating, from the violent pro&s;ecution of his Father-in-law, that him&s;elf was not like to continue long, took liberty to exhibit accu&s;ations again&s;t him al&s;o, &s;o that at length the King commanded him to be arre|&s;ted, and &s;ent to <HI>Amboi&s;e,</HI> where he was kept till he made an e|&s;cape, without ever knowing the cau&s;e of his Impri&s;onment, and is now at his own hou&s;e in full liberty, and &s;ecurity.</P>

<P>The Duke of <HI>Vendo&s;me</HI> who was Governour of the Province, and had made great preparations to block up the Duke of <HI>Soubize</HI> in the Port of <HI>Blavet,</HI> pre&s;ently rallies up two thou&s;and Foot, and two hundred Gentlemen, to force him in the Port, and with an Iron Chaine, and a Cable, as big as a mans thigh, &s;tops the mouth of it, which was very narrow and clo&s;e adjoyning to the Fort; So that <HI>Soubize</HI> for three whole weeks was locked up in it, ha|ving nothing to guard his &s;hips, and man the Town of <HI>Blavet</HI> (who&s;e advenue, which was very &s;traight, he had cut off) with|al, but the above-&s;aid number of three hundred Souldiers; and was reduced to &s;uch an extremity, that the day before he got off, his great Ship called the <HI>Virgin,</HI> endured a battery of &s;ix pieces of Canon, and received an hundred and fifty &s;hot.</P>

<P>While things were thus carried on in <HI>Foix,</HI> the Duke <HI>d' E|spernon,</HI> with fifteen hundred Hor&s;e, and four thou&s;and Foot, advances towards <HI>Montauban</HI> to ravage the Countrey therea|bouts; and <HI>Soubize,</HI> to divert him, makes a de&s;cent into <HI>Medoc,</HI> where he took &s;ome Gari&s;ons: But under&s;tanding that <HI>Manti,</HI> with the Admiral of <HI>Zealand,</HI> named <HI>Haultin,</HI> were coming a|gain&s;t him with forty good Ships of War, he re-imbarques, meets, fights, and defeats them, &s;inks five of their Ships, of which the Vice-Admiral of <HI>Zealand</HI> was one, and kills them more than fifteen hun|dred men.</P>
<P>The news of this defeat, made them change their note at Court, and whereas before they protracted the Treaty in expe|ctation of the i&s;&s;ue of this fight, now, &s;eeing it proved to their di&s;advantage, they conclude it, and &s;end Deputies to the <HI>Rochel|lers,</HI> to receive their acceptance of it: <HI>Forain</HI> al&s;o goes to them from the Duke of <HI>Rohan,</HI> who, con&s;idering the indi&s;po&s;i|tion of the King of <HI>England,</HI> and the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> towards their party, advi&s;ed them to accept of that peace their Naval Victory had purcha&s;ed them; to which <HI>Soubize</HI> adds his per&s;wa&s;i|ons al&s;o; but the <HI>Rochellers</HI> very indi&s;creet in that particular, and according to the humour of people as in&s;olent in pro&s;perity, as deje|cted in adver&s;ity, refufe to hearken to it, without a pre&s;ent demoliti|on of the Fort.</P>

<P>In the mean time the King takes great care &s;peedily to repair his Fleet, and obtains of the King of <HI>England</HI> &s;even great Ships; So that the delayes the <HI>Rochellers</HI> u&s;ed in concluding the Treaty of peace, gave their enemies opportunity to corrupt &s;ome of the Captains of <HI>Soubize</HI> his Fleet, and among others, his Vice-Ad|miral <HI>Fozan:</HI> At the &s;ame time al&s;o the Duke of <HI>Montmorency</HI> re&s;olves upon a de&s;cent into the I&s;le of <HI>R&eacute;,</HI> and to make an at|tempt upon <HI>Soubize</HI> his Fleet which lay in the <HI>Fo&s;s de l' Oye,</HI> a Road joyning to the Town of <HI>Saint Martin de R&eacute;;</HI> a ra&s;h and &s;en&s;ele&s;s enterprize in appearance, which yet treachery made fei&s;ible, and purcha&s;ed it a far different Character.</P>
<P>Then came <HI>Milletiere</HI> and <HI>Madiane</HI> to <HI>Rochelle,</HI> with the Articles of peace agreed on at <HI>Fontainbleau;</HI> but it was then, when <HI>Soubize,</HI> who was in the I&s;le of <HI>R&eacute;,</HI> &s;ent them word thence, that the King's Navy were &s;ayling towards him, and that with all &s;peed they &s;hould tran&s;port them&s;elves into the I&s;land: At fir&s;t, every one laughed at this Me&s;&s;age, nay, and there were &s;ome in <HI>Rochelle</HI> offered to lay great wagers, that the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and <HI>Dutch</HI> Ships were called off again: <HI>Soubize</HI> reiterates his Me&s;&s;ages, and for the la&s;t time &s;ummons them to his a&s;&s;i&s;tance: There were then in <HI>Rochelle</HI> eight hundred Gentlemen well moun|ted, and about eight or nine hundred Souldiers, of <HI>Soubize</HI> his Army, with the greate&s;t part of his Officers, and among others the Counts of <HI>Laval,</HI> and <HI>Loudriere:</HI> Upon this la&s;t &s;ummons they all make ready to imbarque; but the Maior diverted them, per&s;wading them that they were better to expect the morning, than run the hazard of the evening Tide, and &s;o made them lo&s;e all opportunity to tran&s;port them&s;elves; For the next morning appeared thirteen of the King's great Ships in the Road, which prevented their pa&s;&s;age over: <HI>Soubize</HI> &s;eeing him&s;elf thus aban|doned, lands all his Foot, which were not above fifteen hun|dred Souldiers, leaving only an hundred in his great &s;hip called the <HI>Virgin;</HI> commands his Admiral <HI>Guiton,</HI> and his Vice-Ad|miral <HI>Fozan,</HI> not to &s;tirre out of the Road, where they were &s;e|cure, but there to wait his further Orders; And then divides his Army into three Squadrons, to &s;ecure tho&s;e three places, which he conceived mo&s;t obnoxious to danger, and where he thought it mo&s;t probable that the enemies &s;hould attempt to land: But, notwith&s;tanding all his care, he could not di&s;patch time enough, before <HI>Toiras</HI> had landed three thou&s;and Foot, and fifteen hundred Hor&s;e; whereupon he re&s;olved to draw all his men into a body, and fight him the next day, which accordingly he did: At the fir&s;t on&s;et he routed the Avantguard, and &s;lew about three or foure&s;core of the mo&s;t forward of them; but being relieved by

the main body, <HI>Bellesbat</HI> who commanded <HI>Soubize</HI> his left wing, in&s;tead of &s;econding him, faced about, and plunged him&s;elf, and the whole party he commanded in the Mar&s;hes: This much en|couraged the Enemy, who now oppre&s;&s;ed <HI>Soubize</HI> on all &s;ides, who&s;e Major General <HI>Verger-Malague,</HI> and &s;ome of his Captains being &s;lain, the re&s;t fled in &s;uch confu&s;ion, that all the Art and Indu&s;try of <HI>Soubize</HI> could not rally them againe; who yet that day, even by the confe&s;&s;ion of his enemies, ju&s;tly purcha&s;ed the reputation of a worthy Commander, and valiant Souldier. The remainder of his Troops he drew off to <HI>Saint Martin de R&eacute;,</HI> where he made account to tran&s;port them againe to his &s;hips, and once more try his Fortune in a battaile at Sea; But there he found, &s;o great a terrour had po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed <HI>Guiton,</HI> that contrary to his expre&s;s command, he had turned out the hundred Souldiers left in the <HI>Virgin;</HI> and that <HI>Fozan,</HI> with &s;ome Captains, com|bined in the &s;ame con&s;piracy with him, to intimidate the re&s;t, had runne aground the be&s;t &s;hips, and that the re&s;t, &s;eeing them&s;elves thus betrayed, and abandoned, &s;hifted every one, the be&s;t he could, for him&s;elf; all but the <HI>Virgin,</HI> in which there were only five Men left, but very re&s;olute, who &s;eeing four of the King's &s;hips making towards them, re&s;olved to &s;tand it out again&s;t all extremities: The enemy came up to, grappled with, and boorded them, whereupon the Ma&s;ter, who&s;e name was <HI>Du|rand,</HI> leaps into the powder with a lighted match, and blows up all the five Ships together, in which there peri&s;hed &s;even hundred thir|ty &s;ix men.</P>
<P>In this accident there was one thing very remarkable, con|cerning one <HI>Chaligny</HI> a Gentleman of <HI>Poictou,</HI> and his &s;on, who were two of the five left in the Ship: The father, before the fi|ring of the Magazine, being wounded, and di&s;abled to &s;ave him|&s;elf by &s;wimming, commanded his &s;on to &s;hift for him&s;elf, who, with much reluctancy, at length obeyed him; but the good man, being in the protection of God, was as well pre&s;erved, as his Sonne; for being, by the force of the Powder, carried up into the aire, he chanced to fall into a Shalloup of the enemies, without receiving any further harm at all, and was afterwards ran|&s;omed.</P>
<P><HI>Soubize</HI> finding his affairs in &s;o broken a condition, leaves his Major General <HI>Le Parc d' Archiat,</HI> at <HI>Saint Martin d' R&eacute;,</HI> and in a Shalloup gets to the I&s;le of <HI>Oleron,</HI> where he provides the be&s;t he could for the pre&s;ervation of it, leaving five hundred men in the Fort, which he furni&s;hed with all nece&s;&s;aries, and then, with &s;even of his &s;hips, which had retired thither, &s;ets out to &s;ea, and out of the reliques of his late Fleet, gets together

two and twenty Ships, with which he pa&s;&s;es into <HI>England</HI> to re|pair them: After which, <HI>Le Parc d' Archiat,</HI> made an honou|rable compo&s;ition, which was al&s;o well ob&s;erved, and drew off all his men from the I&s;le of <HI>R&eacute;</HI> to <HI>Rochelle;</HI> But tho&s;e that <HI>Soubize</HI> left in the I&s;le of <HI>Oleron</HI> yielded them&s;elves ba&s;ely, a thing not unu&s;ual after &s;uch routs; for it is not given to all men, to have their courages of an equal temper in adver&s;ity and pro|&s;perity.</P>
<P>This fatal accident did not &s;o much deject the &s;pirits of the <HI>Rochellers,</HI> as it elevated theirs at Court: For when <HI>Milletiere</HI> and <HI>Madiane,</HI> returned thither with the <HI>Rochellers</HI> acceptance of the peace, they would not endure any further mention of it; but to break them by a divi&s;ion, continued their old project of gran|ting a peace to the higher and lower <HI>Languedoc,</HI> excluding <HI>Rochelle,</HI> and <HI>Soubize.</HI></P>
<P>While the&s;e things thus pa&s;&s;ed in tho&s;e parts, they of <HI>Azil</HI> held out beyond the expectation of their friends, and the hopes of their enemies that be&s;ieged them, who from a battery of Nine Guns &s;ent them in three thou&s;and &s;hot, and made three indif|ferent large breaches: But the enemy preparing to give them a general, and furious &s;torme, <HI>Bretigny,</HI> and <HI>Saint Blancart,</HI> who had &s;everal times relieved them, re&s;olved, now at this la&s;t pu&s;h, to Rack all their powers for them; The conduct of this relief was undertaken by <HI>Saint Blancart,</HI> who got in to them with three hundred and fifty men, forcing, in his pa&s;&s;age, a Court of guard which kept a Bridge, with the lo&s;s of one man only: The arri|val of this renfort &s;ilenced all di&s;putes, among the be&s;ieged, con|cerning the command, which before had occa&s;ioned &s;ome divi|&s;ions among them; but all acknowledging <HI>Saint Blancart</HI> for their Superiour, he &s;o well ordered all things, that after the ex|pence of eighteen hundred Canon Bullets within the &s;pace ofthree dayes, the Mar&s;hal <HI>Themines</HI> gave them a fierce a&s;&s;ault with his whole Army, commanding al&s;o five hundred Reformado's to di&s;mount, and &s;erve on Foot (there being many hundreds of people that had placed them&s;elves on the tops of Mountains to behold this fight:) Thrice was he repul&s;ed with the lo&s;s of above five hun|dred men; Within the Town the Capta in <HI>Vallette</HI> who comman|ded at one of the breaches was there &s;laine, &s;ome other Officers too, the be&s;ieged lo&s;t, together with &s;eventy or eighty Souldiers &s;laine and wounded: But above all, either friends or enemies, <HI>Saint Blancart</HI> there Renowned him&s;elf, both by his prudent care and vigilance in repairing the breaches, and his Valour in defen|ding them, being alwayes ready in per&s;on at all places of grea|te&s;t danger; in this action &s;urpa&s;&s;ing even him&s;elf: The Mar|&s;hal

<P>This &s;mall &s;ucce&s;s, together with the effect the Duke of <HI>Ro|han</HI>'s continual &s;ollicitations wrought upon the people of <HI>Ni&s;mes,</HI> inducing them to declare for his party, relevated his affairs out of the drooping condition they were in: Some of our Deputies then attending the Court, were about the &s;ame time &s;ent to the Communalties to procure their acceptance of the peace, exclu|ding <HI>Rochelle</HI> and <HI>Soubize,</HI> which many ill affected zealou&s;ly promoted, e&s;pecially at <HI>Ca&s;tres,</HI> where they had re&s;olved to a&s;|&s;ent to it upon tho&s;e terms: But <HI>Rohan</HI> arriving there in the nick, and urging their former re&s;olutions to the contrary, made them alter their intentions, and then &s;ummoned an A&s;&s;embly at <HI>Millaud,</HI> where the Towns of <HI>Ni&s;mes</HI> and <HI>U&s;ez</HI> appeared by their Deputies, and all unanimou&s;ly made an Act of acceptance joyntly with <HI>Soubize</HI> and <HI>Rochelle,</HI> and &s;ent it to the Court.</P>

<P>Thus was our peace concluded, where we mu&s;t ob&s;erve, that the King, out of fear of the &s;upplies the Duke of <HI>Soubize</HI> had pro|cured in <HI>England,</HI> taking occa&s;ion from, and making very good u&s;e of the di&s;contents of the Engli&s;h Amba&s;&s;adours, &s;ent <HI>Botru</HI> into <HI>England,</HI> who &s;o well managed all, that during his Emba&s;&s;y, which la&s;ted but three weeks, he obtained a <HI>Renvoy</HI> of new Am|ba&s;&s;adours thence to <HI>France,</HI> to conclude all things concerning the League, upon condition they &s;hould enforce the Deputies of the Religion to accept a peace, upon very ambiguous and uncer|tain terms, e&s;pecially for the Town of <HI>Rochelle;</HI> who, in regard they had no hopes of any con&s;iderable relief from any other part, were of nece&s;&s;ity obliged to be &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive to them. The Deputies al|&s;o of the particular Provinces, to &s;hew that they of the Religion prefer'd the advancement of the grand de&s;ign of the League be|fore their own &s;ecurity, and to remove out of the way the pretence
<PB N="115" REF="62">
of the Kings Coun&s;el for not &s;igning it, while the War continued in <HI>France,</HI> did the like: But &s;o re&s;olute was the demeanour of the Dutche&s;s of <HI>Rohan</HI> towards the Engli&s;h Amba&s;&s;adours, and the Cardinal <HI>Richelieu,</HI> to whom he prote&s;ted, that unle&s;s the Amba&s;|&s;adours interpo&s;ed in it, nothing &s;hould be concluded, that, after &s;he had neatly broken a particular Treaty of the <HI>Rochellers,</HI> carried on by their Deputies, whom the Court-party, and the Duke of <HI>Trimo&uuml;ille</HI> had drawn over to them, &s;he prevailed &s;o far upon them all, that contrary to their former re&s;olutions, they intere&s;&s;ed them|&s;elves in it. This &s;helter'd her from the malice of her enemies, and the Deputies from any blame that might be imputed to them from their Communalties, and al&s;o obliged the King of <HI>England,</HI> &s;eeing that the peace was accepted by his advice, to &s;ee it faithful|ly ob&s;erved, to which his Amba&s;&s;adours more &s;trictly bound them|&s;elves by a formal Deed, &s;igned, and &s;ealed with their own Arms; &s;o that the conclu&s;ion of our peace was an univer&s;al joy both to the Court, and all Forraign Amba&s;&s;adours there re&s;iding; but fifteen dayes after, when contrary to the &s;olemn prote&s;tations made to them concerning that particular, they &s;aw al&s;o this Treaty in the <HI>Valtoline</HI> was concluded by the King, &amp; the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> they were clouded with no le&s;s di&s;content; e&s;pecially the Engli&s;h, when they perceived, that betrayed by delu&s;ory hopes, they had been made the in&s;truments, to oblige us to accept a peace &s;o much to our di&s;ad|vantage.</P>
<P>Thus did the French, in cou&s;ening the Engli&s;h, and all the Princes intere&s;&s;ed in the League, deceive them&s;elves al&s;o, having done nothing in this affair, that tended not to the advantage of <HI>Spain,</HI> the oppre&s;&s;ion of the Allies of the Crown, and the great detriment of <HI>France</HI> it &s;elf.</P>
<P>This is an account of the pa&s;&s;aget in the &s;econd War; in the progre&s;s of which <HI>Rohan</HI> and <HI>Soubize</HI> were oppo&s;ed by all the Grandees, even of the &s;ame Religion, whom either too much en|vy, or too little zeal, had aliened from their party, by all the Offi|cers of the Crown, and a great part of the mo&s;t eminent of every Town, whom their own covetou&s;ne&s;s, and the allurements of the Courts had blinded; as for the Forraign Nations, the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and <HI>Hollanders</HI> contributed their Ships, and <HI>Germany</HI> it &s;elf &s;tood in need of the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of others; &s;o that it is no great wonder if a better peace could not be obtained; but yet was it much more ad|vantageous than the former, fora&s;much as tho&s;e of the Religion pre&s;erv'd their Fortifications, and got the King of <HI>Englands</HI> caution for the performance of it; God will a&s;&s;i&s;t us more powerfully, when our entire conver&s;ion to him makes us more capable of his favour.</P>

<P>_AFter the peace was thus accepted by tho&s;e of the Religion, <HI>Bri&s;on</HI> only, who had not taken up Armes till towards the end of the War, &s;eeing that a &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the Trea|ty of peace would dive&s;t him of <HI>Pou&s;in,</HI> a place upon the <HI>Rhone,</HI> which, nor long before, he had &s;urprized, refu&s;ed to be compri&s;ed in it; encouraged thereunto by the Con&s;table <HI>Le&s;diguieres,</HI> who after his return out of <HI>Piedmont,</HI> being in &s;ome disfavour at Court, and unwilling to return thither, but catching at all employments hat might colour his abode in his own Government, made very good u&s;e of this occa&s;ion, which he &s;o well improved, that having &s;pun out this affair for &s;ome months, he at length procured <HI>Bri|&s;on</HI>
<PB N="118" REF="64">
an ample Pardon, and forty thou&s;and Crowns, in lieu of that place, which was yielded up by him, and afterwards, by the King's command demoli&s;hed.</P>
<P>This was the la&s;t Act of the Con&s;table's life, which &s;ud|denly after the termination of this affaire, crowned with many dayes and much honour, he yielded up at <HI>Valence:</HI> He was a Gentleman of <HI>Dauphine,</HI> who by his valour, prudence, and good fortune, having pa&s;&s;ed through all the le&s;&s;er charges of the War, had advanced him&s;elf to the highe&s;t: And had not &s;o con&s;tant and uninterrupted a cour&s;e of pro&s;perity, effaced, towards his latter end, all &s;hame in him, &s;o that, he di&s;honoured God, by his dome&s;tick, and infamous debauches, &s;ullying his hou&s;e with Adulteries, and publique Ince&s;ts, he might have ju&s;tly been parallel'd with the greate&s;t Per&s;ons, Antiquity can boa&s;t of!</P>
<P>From this amicable compo&s;ure of our Inte&s;tine differences, &s;prung faire hopes of the duration of our peace; which in a &s;hort time al&s;o withered: For it was contrary to the intention of tho&s;e that aimed to rai&s;e their fortunes upon the ruines of tho&s;e of the Religion: Among&s;t whom the Marque&s;s <HI>de Portes</HI> was the mo&s;t violent, who favoured by the command he had in the lower <HI>Lan|guedoc,</HI> left no way uneffayed to force the people upon &s;ome de|&s;perate cour&s;e; of whom he exacted contributions as in the time of the War, though by the Articles of the Treaty, they were en|tirely aboli&s;hed: But this being not enough to provoke a people harra&s;&s;ed with &s;o many and yet &s;marting mi&s;chiefs, and cove|tous to enjoy the &s;mall repo&s;e they po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, they fly to another invention; which was to ground a jealou&s;ie upon the Duke of <HI>Rohan</HI>'s &s;tay at <HI>Ni&s;mes,</HI> which many, out of a de&s;ire, either to con&s;erve an old ill paid pen&s;ion, or to purcha&s;e a new one, fo|mented with frequent calumnies, no week pa&s;&s;ing without &s;ome new accu&s;ations exhibited again&s;t him, upon which, and the fa|cility they propo&s;ed to them&s;elves of expelling him the Town, they re&s;olve to make him the object of their malice, fur|thering their de&s;ign by an occa&s;ion taken from the annual electi|ons of the Con&s;uls for <HI>Ni&s;mes,</HI> who are alwayes cho&s;en at the later end of the year.</P>
<P>Whiles they &s;o indu&s;triou&s;ly labour his ruine here, they are nothing le&s;s remi&s;s to procure it in the other Provinces, and in|deed over all <HI>France,</HI> &s;triking at him by the National Synod, ap|pointed to be held at <HI>Castres</HI> as a place mo&s;t animated again&s;t the Duke, for that during the la&s;t War, he had u&s;ed &s;ome &s;everity towards &s;ome per&s;ons of quality in that Town, that would have betrayed him. Thither was &s;ent Commi&s;&s;ioner <HI>Galand,</HI> a per|&s;on
<PB N="119" REF="64">
without contradiction of very great abilities, but withal mercenary, and void of &s;hame, or con&s;cience, with in&s;tructions to di&s;approve the Duke of <HI>Rohan</HI>'s late engagement in armes, to di&s;advow his forraign Intelligences, and, if po&s;&s;ible, to get him ex|communicated.</P>
<P>The Duke &s;eeing two &s;uch &s;trong batteries rai&s;ed again&s;t him, and threatning more danger than the War it &s;elf, prepares to defend him&s;elf again&s;t their violence: And fora&s;much as that of the Synod &s;eemed to be of greate&s;t con&s;equence, he endeavoured to &s;ecure him&s;elf again&s;t it, by procuring, in &s;everal Provinces of <HI>France,</HI> the election of &s;uch per&s;ons for Deputies, as were men of an inflexible integrity both to the Party and him&s;elf too, and draws up a Declaration, remon&s;trating chiefly the ju&s;t cau&s;e he had to u&s;e &s;uch proceedings again&s;t tho&s;e he had formerly expel|led the Town; for that he know that to be the principal crime they had to charge him with in the Synod: And fora&s;much as the Town at a publick con&s;ultation had ordered their gates to be kept &s;hut again&s;t him, and that he feared the like u&s;age from them to any &s;hould come from him, he very privately made choice of an|other Mini&s;ter, in the room of his own Chaplaine, to commu|nicate his Declaration to his friends, and to entreat <HI>Beaufort</HI> the Deputy of the <HI>Sevenes</HI> to deliver his Letter, which he had writ|ten to the Synod, with charge, that neither the one, nor the o|ther &s;hould di&s;cover them&s;elves, but when it might be very &s;ea|&s;onable; which happened well to him; for they were prepared to refu&s;e admittance to any that &s;hould come from him; nay, <HI>Mar|met</HI> his Chaplain, though he prote&s;ted, that he came only a|bout an affair of particular concernment to him&s;elf, could not be permitted any longer &s;tay there, than of four and twenty houres.</P>
<P>On the fifteenth of <HI>September,</HI> in the year 1626, <HI>Chauve</HI> was cho&s;en Moderator, <HI>Bouterou&euml;</HI> A&s;&s;i&s;tant, <HI>Blondel</HI> Pa&s;tor, and <HI>Petit</HI> an Advocate of <HI>Ni&s;mes</HI> Scribe. And now <HI>Galand</HI> be&s;tirres him&s;elf again&s;t the Duke of <HI>Rohan,</HI> who&s;e enemies in <HI>Ca&s;tres</HI> are no le&s;s diligent in preparing the venome they had to poure out a|gain&s;t the Duke in the Synod, animated al&s;o thereunto by the Commi&s;&s;ioner <HI>Galland:</HI> But all their de&s;ignes vani&s;hed into air: For the Deputies being before &s;ufficiently &s;atisfied with the rea|&s;ons moving the Duke to proceed again&s;t them in that manner, made them not dare to pre&s;ent any bill again&s;t him to the Synod; who neverthele&s;s could not conceale the di&s;plea&s;ure they had con|ceived again&s;t tho&s;e of <HI>Castres,</HI> with whom they di&s;claimed a|ny future reconciliation; &s;o that they were now become a gene|ral abomination; and the only way to ruine any affaire, was to
<PB N="120" REF="65">
offer it to <HI>Galand</HI>'s recommendation; And thus ended the Synod, where, by the Kings command, (that he might abridge tho&s;e of the Religion, of their liberty of convening any Generall A&s;|&s;emblies) were cho&s;en the Deputies General: The &s;ix nomina|ted, were the Count <HI>de la Suze,</HI> the Marque&s;s of <HI>Galerande,</HI> and <HI>Beaufort</HI> for the Nobility: and for the Commonalty, <HI>Texier, Dupuy</HI> Deputy of <HI>Burgogne,</HI> and <HI>Bazin;</HI> of whom <HI>Galerande</HI> and <HI>Bazin</HI> were accepted.</P>
<P>This affair thus terminated, we mu&s;t now reflect upon the Con|&s;ulate of <HI>Ni&s;mes.</HI> The Pre&s;idial, or Soveraign Court of the Town, according to the humour of many Corporations, not brooking the Duke of <HI>Rohan</HI> &s;o near them, joyned with a Party compo&s;ed of many per&s;ons of Note in the Town, whom the Court faction had invited, and drawn over to them: But finding them&s;elves yet too weak, by ordinary and Legal wayes, to pro|mote to the Con&s;ulate Creatures of their own, they re&s;olve to engage the Royal power in it, and to effect it by wayes unu&s;ual and de&s;tructive to their own Priviledges, and contrary to the Articles of the late Peace. To which end, they &s;end privately to the Court, where they obtain a Commi&s;&s;ion directed to the Chamber of Edict in <HI>Languedoc,</HI> to go and order the &s;aid E|lection of the Con&s;uls; and that nothing might be omitted to forward their de&s;ign, the Duke of <HI>Montmorency</HI> is &s;ent from the Court into his government, who pa&s;&s;es by <HI>Ni&s;mes,</HI> where he en|courages tho&s;e of his Faction, which he &s;trengthens with the neighbouring Nobility; and tho&s;e he could not win to his Party, he forces to ab&s;ent them&s;elves from the Town, till the bu&s;ine&s;s was determined: And for as much as the Marque&s;s of <HI>Montbrun</HI> to|wards the latter end of the former war, had gained &s;ome credit among the Populacy, he was al&s;o &s;ent for out of <HI>Dauphine;</HI> for they hoped not only to make &s;uch Con&s;uls as &s;hould be at their devotion, but upon the Dukes oppo&s;ing him&s;elf again&s;t it, to hale him out of the Town, dead or alive: The&s;e things thus pre|pared, the day of Election comes; the Marque&s;s of <HI>Montbrun</HI> al&s;o arrives at the time appointed, &s;o do <HI>Mon&s;ac, DeSuc,</HI> and the two <HI>Deans</HI> (or Seniour Coun&s;ellors) of the Chamber, who were nominated Commi&s;&s;ioners for this affair; who declaring their charge to the Deputies of the Town, receive for an&s;wer, their fixed re&s;olutions, to maintain the Priviledges of the Town: The Common-Council of which meet according to their accu&s;tomed manner, in the morning to proceed to the &s;aid Election; whither the Commi&s;&s;ioners go al&s;o; but finding the doors of the Town|hou&s;e &s;hut, are fain to return to their lodgings, where they de|clare again&s;t the proceedings of the Common-Council, and &s;end
<PB N="121" REF="65">
about the Town to a&s;&s;emble the Inhabitants for a new Election; &s;ome refu&s;e to &s;tir, others go, but without any commotion in the Town were obliged to retire again.</P>
<P>Now the new Con&s;uls enter not into their Office, till a moneth after the Election; &s;o that the Court had lea&s;ure to &s;end a Pro|hibition to tho&s;e that were elected, forbidding them to meddle with the Office, and enjoyning the old ones to continue the ex|erci&s;e of it, till it were otherwi&s;e ordered: notwith&s;tanding which, when the fir&s;t day of the year was come, the Baron <HI>d' Aubais, Genoyer, Saguter,</HI> and <HI>Peli&s;&s;iere,</HI> according to the u&s;ual manner took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Con&s;ulate; where we &s;hall leave them in repo&s;e, to look further back upon the affairs, and view their propen&s;ity to new imbroylments.</P>
<P>When the Peace was concluded in the year 1626, it was con|ceived, that the Cardinal <HI>Richelieu</HI>'s thoughts would be wholly bent on forraign affairs, of which he gave &s;ome &s;emblant evi|dence: The Prince of <HI>Piedmont,</HI> then at Court, was nominated Leiutenant-General of the Kings Armies for forraign Parts; then hoped the <HI>Venetian</HI> Amba&s;&s;adours, they &s;hould now &s;ee <HI>Italy</HI> freed from the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> oppre&s;&s;ion; the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> that they would re|cover the <HI>Palatinate;</HI> and preparations were making (but in words only) for all the&s;e de&s;igns; of the reality of which if any one &s;eemed to doubt, it was confirmed by a thou&s;and oaths: But when a few dayes after the &s;igning of the Peace with tho&s;e of the Religion, unknown to all the Confederates, was &s;igned al&s;o that of <HI>France</HI> with <HI>Spain;</HI> then brake forth complaints and di&s;con|tents of the one &s;ide, &s;econded by excu&s;es of the other, every one ca&s;ting the blame upon another, e&s;pecially upon. <HI>Fargis</HI> Am|ba&s;&s;adour in <HI>Spain,</HI> who&s;e Wife, as if he had exceeded the limits of his Commi&s;&s;ion, was made to &s;ue out his Pardon: but the&s;e pretences could not &s;alve the di&s;tempers of the Confederates in|tere&s;&s;ed in the League, which &s;ome of them afterwards upon oc|ca&s;ions did di&s;cover.</P>
<P>The cau&s;e of this &s;udden and unexpected peace, was attributed to a de&s;ire the Cardinal had to live &s;ome time in quiet, that he might the better &s;ecure his own greatne&s;s. and that nothing might ob&s;truct his pur&s;uit of the de&s;ign again&s;t <HI>Rochelle,</HI> where he intended to do great matters; or el&s;e to &s;ome Jealou&s;ie he had conceived of a new party, to be rai&s;ed in <HI>France,</HI> under the com|mand of the Duke <HI>Anjou</HI> to ruin him; but whether it was the one, or the other, or both together, certainly the occa&s;ion of the&s;e en&s;uing factions, gave him fair colours for any de&s;ign.</P>
<P>The Queen Mother de&s;irous to marry the Duke of <HI>Anjou,</HI> would needs con&s;ummate the Match, de&s;igned by <HI>Henry</HI> the great, be|tween
<PB N="122" REF="66">
him and the Prince&s;s of <HI>Montpen&s;ier,</HI> which he was ab&s;o|lutely aver&s;e from; whether this aver&s;ion proceeded from him|&s;elf, or the &s;ugge&s;tions of others, not de&s;irous this treaty &s;hould take effect; which encouraged many to joyn with him. But the Prince of <HI>Cond&eacute;,</HI> and his Wife, whom this marriage threat|ned with a remove &s;o many degrees from the Crown, as the Duke of <HI>Anjou</HI> &s;hould have Sons; The Count of <HI>Soi&s;&s;ons</HI> for the &s;ame rea&s;on, and out of hopes he had to marry that Prince&s;s him&s;elf: The Duke of <HI>Longueville</HI> out of Jealou&s;ie of the Duke of <HI>Gui&s;e,</HI> who&s;e Sons were all Brothers to the Prince&s;s <HI>Montpen&s;ier;</HI> The Duke of <HI>Vendo&s;me</HI> upon the &s;ame con&s;ideration, to which his Brother the Grand Prior of <HI>France</HI> added his di&s;contents again&s;t the Cardinal, who had deluded him with promi&s;es of the Admi|ralty of <HI>France,</HI> which afterwards under another title, he re&s;erved to him&s;elf; many of the chief Nobility out of particular Inte|re&s;ts; The Queen who feared the others fertility would preju|dice her in the King her Husbands and his Subjects affections; and the King him&s;elf induced by &s;everal apprehen&s;ions, oppo&s;ed it: See here very con&s;iderable ob&s;tacles to be removed.</P>
<P>Neverthele&s;s the Queen-Mother, who with good rea&s;on grounded on her own, &amp; the Intere&s;t of the State, was very zealous for this mar|riage, de&s;pairs not, but begins her de&s;ign with an attempt to gain the Colonel <HI>d' Ornano,</HI> who was formerly the Duke of <HI>Anjou</HI>'s Go|vernour, and continuing &s;till his Favourite had a great influence on him: To this end, &s;he gets him made Mar&s;hal of <HI>France;</HI> but what ever promi&s;es the&s;e honours extracted from him, they quickly vani&s;hed, as &s;oon as he &s;aw the Prince&s;s of <HI>Conde,</HI> who&s;e beauty and attractions rai&s;ed in him &s;o much love and vanity, as totally blinded him; &s;o that being care&s;&s;ed and &s;ued to of all hands, he lo&s;t him&s;elf in that Maze of felicity: the better to car|ry on his own de&s;igns with her, he pretends to the Queen-Mother that his &s;ervices are wholly bent to effect her de&s;ires, and pro|cure her contentment, when really the charms of that Prince&s;s had drawn him entirely to her devotion; 'Twas &s;he al&s;o governed the Queen, propo&s;ing to her the di&s;re&s;pect and contempt the Children of the Duke of <HI>Anjou</HI> would bring upon her; and that if he mu&s;t needs be married, her Si&s;ter the <HI>Infanta</HI> of <HI>Spain</HI> would be a more convenient match for him: But all this while this Prin|ce&s;s hoped that having clearly gained the Mar&s;hall <HI>d' Ornano</HI> to her a&s;&s;i&s;tance, &s;he &s;hould in the depth of this Labyrinth find out a way to conduct her own Daughter to the Dukes bed. See here three Parties in one, the Queens, and tho&s;e of the two Princes of the blood, all which, though for different rea&s;ons, and which they concealed the one from the other, con&s;pire to impede this
<PB N="123" REF="66">

On the other &s;ide, the Queen-Mother pa&s;&s;ionately pro&s;ecutes the accompli&s;hment of the Marriage; e&s;pecially the Cardinal, hoping that to effect it again&s;t &s;o many and great oppo&s;itions, would enlarge the Prince&s;s of <HI>Mone|pen&s;iers</HI> obligations to him &s;o, that his power would &s;uffer no di|minution, though misfortune &s;hould alien even the Kings affecti|ons from him; the Prince&s;s of <HI>Conti,</HI> Si&s;ter to the Duke of <HI>Gui&s;e,</HI> and all their family be&s;tir them&s;elves mainly to the &s;ame end, and by the means of the Duke <HI>d' Elbeuf,</HI> who was a Friend of <HI>Baradas</HI> the Kings Favourite, or el&s;e of &s;ome other per&s;ons who engaged them&s;elves in it, the King was al&s;o brought about to rel|li&s;h the match too, out of an apprehen&s;ion infu&s;ed to him, that tho&s;e three factions pretended only a rupture of the marriage, whereas, in effect, their de&s;ign had no other aim but his ruin, to clap him into a Mona&s;tery, and marry the Duke of <HI>Anjou</HI> to the Queen: This impre&s;&s;ion made him now as zealou&s;ly promote, as he had formerly oppo&s;ed the marriage; earne&s;tly importuning his Brother, and &s;ending to the Mar&s;hall <HI>d' Ornano,</HI> who returned large prote&s;tations of obedience to his commands, but that as yet he could not di&s;cover any di&s;po&s;ition in the Duke for it: Thus for &s;ome time was the Mar&s;hall care&s;&s;ed and &s;ued to by all parties.</P>

<P>About this time were intercepted &s;everal packets going into <HI>Spain</HI> and <HI>Savoy,</HI> which occa&s;ioned the &s;ecuring of the Mar&s;hal <HI>d' Ornano,</HI> who was yet &s;omewhat more ceremoniou&s;ly dealt withall then or|dinary, in regard of his Ma&s;ter: The King one afternoon commands the Regiment of his guards into the <HI>Ba&s;&s;e</HI> Court at <HI>Fountainebleau,</HI> under pretence of exerci&s;ing before the Queens; but in&s;tead of returning to their quarters, they po&s;&s;e&s;&s;e them&s;elves of all the advenues of the village, which was al&s;o &s;urrounded by the Caval|ry: And the King going very early to bed, not long after ro&s;e again, &s;ent for he Queen-Mother, the Cardinal, the Chancel|lour, and the Mar&s;hall <HI>Schomberg,</HI> with whom he re&s;olved upon the Arre&s;t, which was executed by the Captain of the Guard.</P>

both in words and ge&s;tures, flies in great fury at the Cardi|nal, demanding of him, if he had been privy to this de&s;ign, who told him that indeed he was not ignorant of it; the &s;ame demand makes he to the Chancellour, who for not daring to advow the action, lo&s;t his &s;eals a few dayes after, and was bani&s;hed the Court.</P>

<P>The Duke of <HI>Anjou</HI> per&s;i&s;ts &s;till in his di&s;content, and is more aver&s;e then ever from the marriage with the Prince&s;s of <HI>Mont|pen&s;ier;</HI> But being yet de&s;titute of any &s;afe retreat, he is inforced to cover his di&s;plea&s;ure with a di&s;&s;embled accommodation with the Cardinal; and hunting often about <HI>Fountainebleau,</HI> re&s;olves one day to go towards <HI>Fleury,</HI> and dine with him, who then lay there; but having notice of the Dukes intentions, and that it was only to do him a di&s;courte&s;ie, departs thence before day, comes to <HI>Fountainebleau</HI> ju&s;t as the Duke was ri&s;ing, and gave him his &s;hirt.</P>
<P>This little di&s;covery rou&s;es the Cardinal, and makes him very &s;ollicitous to provide again&s;t the &s;torms impending over him: he under&s;tands moreover, that all contrivances again&s;t his life come from <HI>Savoy,</HI> that the Abbot of <HI>Scaglia</HI> is the chief In&s;trument imployed in it; that the Queen made u&s;e of the <HI>Dutche&s;s</HI> of <HI>Chevreu&s;e</HI> to animate the Duke of <HI>Anjou</HI> again&s;t him, that the Grand Prior irritated by a private di&s;content, is al&s;o one of the mo&s;t violent again&s;t him, whereupon he re&s;olves to ruine tho&s;e he could, and to rid him&s;elf of the re&s;t the be&s;t he could.</P>

Dutchy in the right of his Wife, and the alliance he was entring into with the Duke of <HI>Retz,</HI> who was very powerful in that Province, and Ma&s;ter of two of the mo&s;t con&s;iderable places in it; that the Grand Prior, the mo&s;t zealous of all the Duke of <HI>An|jou</HI>'s Parti&s;ans, was his brother; that it might be one day a mo&s;t &s;ecure retreat for the Duke, and of dangerous con&s;equence to all <HI>France,</HI> con&s;idering its &s;ituation both &s;o near to <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Spain;</HI> and that it would be expedient to provide timely pre|ventions again&s;t &s;uch fatal accidents. This made the King re|&s;olve upon a journey thither, and to ptepare him&s;elf for it, the whole Court removed back to <HI>Paris;</HI> but the better to conceal the intended voyage, they pretended only a journey to <HI>Blois;</HI> Never|thele&s;s the Grand Prior rightly conceiving that a further progre&s;s was de&s;igned, offers to &s;eek out his Brother, and bring him to ju&s;tifie him&s;elf again&s;t all accu&s;ations whatever; provided he might be &s;ecured by an engagement of their words, not to be inju|red in his per&s;on: this he imparts to the Cardinal, who approves of his de&s;ign, fils him with hopes, but no promi&s;e of &s;ecurity, ad|vi&s;ing him to procure that of the King, which he does, and &s;o de|parts for <HI>Britany.</HI></P>
<P>The Duke of <HI>Anjou</HI> was very unwilling to this Journey, but finding no eva&s;ion for it, at length re&s;olves upon it: All the Court go, except the Count of <HI>Soi&s;&s;ous,</HI> and the Prince&s;s of <HI>Montpen&s;ier,</HI> whom the &s;ickne&s;s of their Mothers &s;tayed behind. The King being at <HI>Blois,</HI> thither came the Duke of <HI>Vendo&s;me</HI> and his Brother: For two dayes together the King made them infinite care&s;&s;es, which the third night he clo&s;es with an Arre&s;t by the Captain of his guards, and then &s;ent them both Pri&s;oners to the Ca&s;tle of <HI>Amboi&s;e.</HI></P>
<P>After this was done, the Cardinal, who had all this while &s;tayed at one of his hou&s;es near <HI>Paris,</HI> comes to <HI>Blois,</HI> openly commi&s;erating the misfortune of the Grand Prior, but not his Brother, in which the whole Court &s;ympathize, for that the one was beloved, but the other hated; and that which mo&s;t moved their compa&s;&s;ion, was, that the Grand Prior had mo&s;t innocently been the In&s;trument of both his own and Brother's di&s;a&s;ter.

<P>It is now to be ob&s;erved, that when <HI>Soubize</HI> left the Fleet, to know the intentions of the <HI>Rochellers,</HI> two things were agreed on between him, and <HI>Buckingham:</HI> Fir&s;t, that the fir&s;t de&s;cent &s;hould be in the I&s;le of <HI>Oleron,</HI> both for the facility of it, there being not above twelve hundred &s;ouldiers to oppo&s;e them, nor any fortre&s;s able to make eight dayes re&s;i&s;tance; and al&s;o for the conveniencies of the place, abounding in corn, and wine, commodious for the maintenance of their Souldiers and Mariners, ea&s;ie to be kept, and that once taken, and the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Ve&s;&s;els guarding the Sea, would in &s;hort time reduce the I&s;le of <HI>R&eacute;</HI> to great extremities; whereas if they made their fir&s;t attempt on the other, which was well &s;to|red with &s;ouldiers, &s;ufficiently fortified to make a good oppo&s;ition, the &s;ucce&s;s of the attempt would be full of hazard, and the con|que&s;t of uncertainty; the other was not to attempt any thing be|fore the Duke of <HI>Soubize</HI> his return: But when <HI>Saint Blancart</HI> came there to acquaint the Duke of <HI>Buckingham</HI> with the i&s;&s;ue of his negotiation in <HI>Rochelle,</HI> he found the de&s;ign varied, a di&s;cent into the I&s;le of <HI>R&eacute;</HI> determined, and ready to be executed, which the Duke of <HI>Buckinghem</HI> al&s;o, not expecting <HI>Soubize</HI> his return, ha&s;tens; whether it was, that he feared le&s;t <HI>Toiras,</HI> who had al|ready three thou&s;and foot, and two hundred hor&s;e in the I&s;land, &s;hould grow too &s;trong, many of the Nobility, and great numbers of &s;ouldiers flocking thither from all parts; or that he was loth

<HI>Soubize</HI> &s;hould participate of the honour of the action. At this di&s;cent there was a &s;mart and gallant combate, the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> like a deluge, over-whelming all that oppo&s;ed them, which greatly terri|fied the <HI>Romani&s;ts;</HI> and had he clo&s;ely pur&s;ued the victory, and gone directly to the Fort, according to the advice of the Duke of <HI>Soubize,</HI> who was by that time gotten thither, he had found it em|pty both of provi&s;ions and &s;ouldiers; but the lo&s;s of five dayes idly trifled away, gave <HI>Toiras</HI> lei&s;ure to rally his &s;cattered men, and to carry all the provi&s;ions, could be found in the Village, up to the Fort.</P>
<P>This only fault drew after it many mi&s;chiefs on the reformed party; in this fight was &s;lain <HI>Saint Blancart,</HI> (who came thither &s;oon enough to land the &s;econd man) de&s;ervedly lamented by his party, being a young man, who&s;e piety, courage, and prudence emulou&s;ly &s;trove to renown him.</P>
<P>This di&s;cent of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> cau&s;ed great commotions at the Court, and, had a &s;udden taking of the Fort &s;ucceeded it, probably a great alteration of affairs had followed: For the &s;ickne&s;s, the King, about the &s;ame time, was &s;urpri&s;ed with, the general di&s;con|tent of the Nobility at the Cardinals favour; the jealou&s;ie of tho&s;e were but lately engaged with the Duke of <HI>Orleans;</HI> the abode of the <HI>Count</HI> of <HI>Soi&s;&s;ons</HI> in <HI>Piedmont,</HI> and the Duke of <HI>Savoy</HI>'s known de&s;ires of revenge, for his de&s;ertion by the <HI>French,</HI> were &s;ufficient grounds for more than ordinary jealou&s;ies; and every one impatiently expected to know the fate of the Fort, that they might declare their affections; which the King well knowing, omitted nothing for its relief; fed the Town of <HI>Rochelle</HI> with hopes of an accommodation, provided they joyned not with the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> e&s;&s;ayed to work upon the Duke of <HI>Rohan</HI> with offers of large &s;ums of money, and di&s;per&s;ed Me&s;&s;engers to all the Reformed Towns, to render odious the di&s;cent of the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> and to draw from them &s;uch Declarations as might &s;ecure him again&s;t the fear of their conjunction with them; and prevailed with <HI>Montauban</HI> and <HI>Ca&s;tres</HI> to &s;end Deputies to the other Corporations to di&s;&s;wade them from it, and by this Argument, that <HI>Rochelle</HI> had not joyned with them.</P>
<P>The Duke of <HI>Rohan,</HI> who for a long while before had been acquainted with the Artifices of the Court, and particularly knew their <HI>Parti&s;ans</HI> in every Town, fore-&s;eeing well that he could not hinder &s;uch Declarations, advi&s;es them to in&s;ert in them the gene|ral clau&s;e, under the benefit of the Edicts, and all other conce&s;&s;i|ons, that &s;o he might in convenient &s;ea&s;on di&s;engage them again, and with hopes of good news from <HI>Rochelle,</HI> engages them not to de&s;ert that Town.

<P>The Duke of <HI>Montmorency,</HI> when he had rallied his Men, drew them off to <HI>Sovill&eacute;,</HI> and there Ranged them again in Bat|taila, but without any &s;emblance of renewing the Fight: The Duke of <HI>Rohan,</HI> for his part, kept the Field more than a long houre, cau&s;ed his dead to be buried, and thanks to be given to God; and then, without any interruption, pa&s;&s;ed the Brook, and kept on his way; but could not reach <HI>Mazeres</HI> till the next day at Noon, after he had been forty houres on hor&s;e-back: In this Fight he lo&s;t <HI>Cau&s;&s;e-Caucallier,</HI> one of his Life-guard, one of his Pages, two Lieutenants of Foot, five or &s;ix Souldiers, and had thirty or forty wounded. Of the Duke of <HI>Montmorency</HI>'s party, were lo&s;t many more, yet was it no bloody Incounter; and it is to be believed that this engagement of his was rather occa&s;io|nal, than before determined; for it &s;eems he had more rea&s;on to charge the Duke of <HI>Rohan</HI> in his pa&s;&s;age over the Brook, than in any other part: But 'tis ea&s;ier to correct the actions of others, when a man is out of danger of the blowes, than in the action it &s;elf, which requires a prompt and &s;udden execution, and af|fords

<P>The &s;ame day <HI>Faucon,</HI> by the Duke of <HI>Rohan</HI>'s order, with two hundred Men, &s;ecured <HI>Montmaur,</HI> a &s;mall Town, and Ca&s;tle lying between <HI>Revel,</HI> and <HI>Mazeres;</HI> but of great con&s;equence for the uniting <HI>Lauraguais,</HI> and <HI>Foix:</HI> This was effected by the intelligence of <HI>La Barte,</HI> whom the Duke of <HI>Montmorency</HI> had highly di&s;gu&s;ted.</P>
<P>The Duke vigorou&s;ly pro&s;ecutes the&s;e fortunate &s;ucce&s;&s;es, and upon hopes of &s;ome Corre&s;pondents in <HI>Pamiez,</HI> on the 22th. of the &s;ame Month he &s;hewes him&s;elf with his Hor&s;e before it, but had no other entertainment than what they &s;ent him from their Mu&s;quets; whereupon he determined, the night following, to clap a Petarde to the Wall, to which he was induced by &s;ome of the Inhabitants, that had given him a meeting near the Town; in&s;tead then of returning to <HI>Saverdun,</HI> whither he was going, he retires to a Covert, half a league from <HI>Pamiez,</HI> forbidding his men to make any fires; thither he commands <HI>Goudin</HI> and <HI>Malmoirac,</HI> with their Regiments, whom he had before ordered to be in a readine&s;s; but tho&s;e that &s;hould have come out of the Town to conduct him to the place, and inform him of the true &s;tate of it, came not to the Rendez-vous; never thele&s;s <HI>Bruel,</HI> one of the Town, Author of this enterpri&s;e, and who knew well enough where the Petarde was to be fixed, being with him, he proceeded in the de&s;igned attempt, which was executed after this manner. <HI>Ca&s;&s;agne</HI> had the command and conduct of the <HI>Petards,</HI> which were carried by Gentlemen of his own, and &s;ome Officers of his Hor&s;e, who were &s;econded by <HI>Leques</HI> with thirty armed Men, and fifty choice Pikes, and Mu&s;quetiers; after whom marched <HI>Goudin,</HI> and <HI>Malmoirac,</HI> then the Duke of <HI>Rohan</HI> him|&s;elf in per&s;on: In this Equipage they come up to the Wall, where, notwith&s;tanding the Allarme, and Volleys of &s;hot, the fir&s;t Pe|tarde was fixed, but the Breach being not large enough, a &s;econd was clapped on, which extended it to a &s;ufficient widene&s;s for an armed man to pa&s;s; whither the Inhabitants flocking to defend the Breach, <HI>Bazier</HI> the Engineer, took a &s;mall Granade, and threw it in through the Hole among them, where it broke, and &s;poiled the Thigh of one of the Defendants, and di&s;&s;ipated the

The taking of the Town in this manner, &s;pread &s;o univer&s;al a terrour over <HI>Foix,</HI> that &s;ome Forts, well &s;tored with all nece&s;&s;aries, gave them&s;elves up for fear. After this the Duke was received into the <HI>Mas d' Azil,</HI> and <HI>Carlat,</HI> by which means he reduced all tho&s;e, that were of the Religion in the County of <HI>Foix,</HI> to his party; and probably had done much more, had the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> enterprizes in the I&s;le of <HI>R&egrave;</HI> pro&s;pered; whom it will be now expedient to look after.</P>
<P>The negligence of the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> gave opportunity to thirteen Barks, laden with provi&s;ions, to come up to the Citadel, where they arrived the &s;ixth of <HI>September,</HI> about the Morning, and got off again the ninth following, carrying with them all the wound|ed and unu&s;eful per&s;ons: The ea&s;ie pa&s;&s;age of the&s;e, encouraged others to the like adventure; but, the Guards being re-inforced by the <HI>Rochellers,</HI> &s;ome of them were taken, and &s;everely dealt withall; and on the la&s;t of <HI>September,</HI> of fifteen or &s;ixteen Barks which came up, &s;even were taken, and the re&s;t put to flight.</P>
<P>On the twelfth of <HI>September</HI> came from <HI>England</HI> a Renfort of fifteen or &s;ixteen hundred Souldiers, with a &s;upply of all other nece&s;&s;aries; whereupon the Duke re&s;olved to attempt the little Fort <HI>De la Pr&eacute;e,</HI> and turned &s;ome of his Canon that way; but this de&s;ign was da&s;hed upon a &s;udden, no man knows why.</P>
<P>On the &s;ixth of <HI>October,</HI> the be&s;ieged, pre&s;&s;ed by &s;trong ne|ce&s;&s;ities, &s;ent out <HI>Montaud</HI> with offers to capitulate, in ca&s;e they were not relieved with victuals the next day: This obliged us to double our Guards, and, as the winde &s;ate, it was ea&s;ie to con|jecture that the relief could not come but from <HI>O&s;onne;</HI> whereupon &s;ome &s;hips were commnaded out to meet them, and prevent their pa&s;&s;age; but, in&s;tead of that, the Captain of the Guard took another cour&s;e, and went wtih his &s;hips to the <HI>Fo&s;&s;e de l' Oye,</HI> while three and thirty Barks, &s;eizing the opportunity, pa&s;&s;ed with|out interruption, and nine and twenty of them came up under the Citadel; where yet it is to be noted, that they could not come near the Land, but upon a great Flood, which comes but every fifteen dayes, by rea&s;on whereof the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> might yet with much facility, have de&s;troyed the relief; which though arrived, yet could not be unladen; &s;o that Propo&s;itions were made to the Duke, a&s;&s;aulting them on both &s;ides by Land, to fire the Barks with what was in them: which might have been done without any prejudice received from the Ca&s;tle, by rea&s;on of the height of the

Banks capable to &s;helter the A&s;&s;ailants: He &s;eemed to approve of this motion, but took no cour&s;e to put it in act; contenting him&s;elf only with trifling away the time in vain attempts to fire them by Sea.</P>
<P>When the relief was gotten in, <HI>Buckingham</HI> calls a Council, who re&s;olve to draw off; &s;o that on the twel&s;th of <HI>October,</HI> they began to re-imbarque their Armes, and other Ammunitions they had upon the Land: After this he &s;ent for a Gentleman belon|ging to the Duke of <HI>Soubize,</HI> to whom he declared that the Council of War, con&s;idering how well the place was &s;tored with all nece&s;&s;aries, the year &s;o far &s;pent, his Army much dimini|&s;hed, and all his Provi&s;ions con&s;umed, had conceived it nece&s;|&s;ary to draw off; The Gentleman endeavoured to di&s;&s;wade him from that re&s;olution, &s;hewing him that the Fleet which the Earl of <HI>Holland</HI> was conducting to them, would &s;ufficiently repaire all tho&s;e nece&s;&s;ities; that the relief the Be&s;ieged had received could not la&s;t long; and that if vigilant guards were kept, they would be &s;oon reduced to their former extremities; that his re|treat now he had engaged them, would be the lo&s;s and ruine of the <HI>Rochellers,</HI> who would ca&s;t all their di&s;plea&s;ure and <HI>odi|um</HI> upon the Duke of <HI>Soubize,</HI> as the Authour of their de&s;tructi|on, and that it would be an irrepatable di&s;-reputation to the King his Ma&s;ters Arms, to have attempted &s;uch an enterpri&s;e with &s;o lit|tle honor and profit.</P>
<P>To all which Arguments he gave no other an&s;wer, than that his Captains would &s;tay no longer; but yet, if the Earl of <HI>Hol|land</HI> came time enough, with his Fleet, he would endeavour to alter their minds: By which the Gentleman concluding that the Duke was fixed in his re&s;olutions to be gone, gave &s;peedy notice of it to the Duke of <HI>Soubize,</HI> who ever &s;ince the middle of <HI>Sep|tember</HI> had lain &s;ick at <HI>Rochelle</HI> of a <HI>tertian</HI> Ague joyned with a great vomiting, de&s;iring him, if po&s;&s;ible, to po&s;t thither; which he did, and at his arrival in the I&s;le of <HI>R&eacute;,</HI> u&s;es all his Art to per&s;wade the Duke of <HI>Buckingham</HI> and his Officers into a better humour, of which they gave him &s;ome &s;mall hopes; but he, neverthele&s;s, &s;eeing them &s;till carrying their things aboard, a&s;&s;ured him&s;elf they would not budge from their former purpo&s;es.</P>
<P>The King, in the mean time, being recovered of his &s;ickne&s;s, comes in per&s;on before <HI>Rochelle;</HI> where his pre&s;ence rai&s;ed both the number and &s;pirits of his Army, and upon intelligence how the Duke of <HI>Buckingham</HI>'s was le&s;&s;ened, re&s;olves to make a di&s;|cent into the I&s;le of <HI>R&eacute;</HI> under the protection of the little Fort <HI>de la Pr&eacute;e,</HI> which had &s;till held out. On the other &s;ide the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI>

men's de&s;ire to return, having made them very carele&s;s of their guards, they &s;uffered &s;even or eight pinnaces to &s;teal up towards the Fort, and on the &s;ixteenth of <HI>October</HI> they land four hun|dred men; the twenty &s;eventh there came up ten more, and on the thirtieth five and twenty; whereupon the Duke of <HI>Bucking|ham</HI> rallies his Men; and, quitting the greate&s;t part of the Tren|ches, marches by night, with what hor&s;e and foot he had, to prevent a di&s;cent already made, commanding out a forlorne of <HI>French,</HI> which not being &s;econded, were enforced to retire. The Merchants of <HI>Rochelle</HI> in the mean time, &s;eeing what preparati|ons were made for his return, in&s;tantly &s;ollicite the Duke to give them fifty or &s;ixty tunnes of Corn he had upon the Shore, which he a&s;&s;ented not to, till they had no lea&s;ure to carry it off, &s;o that they fell to the enemies &s;hare: But before his departure, to &s;hew that he had left nothing unattempted, he re&s;olved to make one e&s;&s;ay more, which re&s;olution he grounded upon the report of &s;ome fugitives from the Fort, who averred that there were but eight hundred &s;ouldiers in it, and tho&s;e too for the greate&s;t part &s;ick; that the Courtain towards the Sea had neither graffe nor Rampart, &s;o that if he mounted his Ladders on that &s;ide, it might be ea&s;ily forced. Without any further information, or batter|ing the Parapetts, he re&s;olves to give a general a&s;&s;ault, propo&s;es it to the <HI>French</HI> Officers, de&s;iring them to di&s;po&s;e the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Colonels to it, and in ca&s;e they &s;hould &s;tick at it, he would then make u&s;e of his power to command them. The attempt thus re|&s;olved on, he prepares his men for the &s;torm, a&s;&s;igning the <HI>En|gli&s;h</HI> and <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> their po&s;t on the land &s;ide, and the <HI>French</HI> mix|ed with <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> towards the Sea: <HI>Manuel</HI> conducted the ten fir&s;t Ladders, but could mount but two, though his party beha|ved them&s;elves with much gallantry and re&s;olution; (but to at|tempt to force by <HI>E&s;calade</HI> above fifteen hundred Men in a Fort with four <HI>Bastions,</HI> well furni&s;hed with Artillery, and all other nece&s;&s;aries, was a way eternally to di&s;courage his Souldiers, ra|ther than to lead them on to the purcha&s;e of any honour) but lea|ving many dead, and carrying off more wounded, they were forced to retire.</P>
<P>This repul&s;e, together with the intelligence of the hourly encrea&s;e of the forces in the Fort <HI>de la Pree,</HI> ha&s;tned the Duke of <HI>Buckingham</HI>'s rai&s;ing the Siege, and his retreat to the <HI>Bay de l' Oye,</HI> to &s;hip his men with more lea&s;ure and &s;ecurity: On the eight of <HI>November</HI> early in the morning the Drums beat for their departure at noon, and &s;carcely was the Rear Guard got out of the Town, but the King's Army appeared much &s;tron|ger in Hor&s;e, and equal to the others in Foot; having this fur|ther

advantage, to pur&s;ue a retreating Army, and &s;eize all oc|ca&s;ions which either the incommodity of the pa&s;&s;es, or the u&s;u|al di&s;orders that attend &s;uch retreats might favour them with. At the pa&s;s <HI>de la Coharde,</HI> they made as though they would have charged them, but ob&s;erving the good order of the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> and the advantage they had of the ground, after a long halt, both Armies marched off, the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> keeping the plain, and the King's Forces the Sea coa&s;t: Beyond this pa&s;s was a hollow way, which cro&s;&s;ing the Mar&s;h, extended it &s;elf as far as the Bridge <HI>de l' Oye:</HI> At the entring of this the Squadrons began to be &s;omewhat pre&s;&s;ed, and to &s;tand upon their defence; but the Van, and then the Body being got into it, the Rear-guard, charged by the Mar&s;hal <HI>Schomberg,</HI> was ea&s;ily routed; in which defeat the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> lo&s;t &s;even or eight hundred men, but the night approaching, favoured their imbarquing of the re&s;t.</P>
<P>In this action the Duke of <HI>Buckingham</HI> committed two great errours; one was, The committing his retreat to the charge of four&s;core Hor&s;e, which being forced in upon the Rear of their own Troops, broke, and confounded them; the other was, His omi&s;&s;ion to rai&s;e a Fort, or &s;ome other defenceable work at the entry of that hollow way, where he had &s;till de&s;igned to make his retreat in ca&s;e of nece&s;&s;ity, which would ab&s;olutely have &s;ecu|red it.</P>
<P>At his departure, he a&s;&s;ures the <HI>Rochellers</HI> of his &s;peedy return to their deliverance, with a more numerous and better fortified Fleet, alledging the inconvenience of the &s;ea&s;on, and defect of provi&s;ions, as the only cau&s;es that obliged him to draw off; and promi&s;ing them a quick and abundant &s;upply of all nece&s;&s;aries for a long defence; and further de&s;ires &s;ome of their Merchants to follow him into <HI>England,</HI> that they might te&s;tifie the inte|grity of his affection and diligence, and that they might them|&s;elves carry back the effects of his promi&s;es. Neverthele&s;s when he drew near the Coa&s;t of <HI>England,</HI> him&s;elf took a fly-boat, &s;ending the <HI>Rochelle</HI> Merchants to expect him at <HI>Bri&s;tol,</HI> de&s;iring the Duke of <HI>Soubize</HI> to do the &s;ame at <HI>Port&s;mouth,</HI> where he would be as &s;oon as he; and then &s;teers his cour&s;e towards <HI>Ply|mouth,</HI> where the Earl of <HI>Holland's</HI> Fleet rode. When he came thither, he gave order that the &s;hips that there lay ready, and laden with Corn for the <HI>Rochellers,</HI> &s;hould be di&s;charged, and the Provi&s;ions &s;old, upon pretence that they would be &s;poyled; which done he gets before to pre-po&s;&s;e&s;s the &s;pirit of the King of great <HI>Britain,</HI> rejecting the blame of the errours committed in the expedition on tho&s;e were no way culpable; So that when
<PB N="152" REF="82">
the Merchants came to exhibite their complaints again&s;t him, they were informed, it was the next way to make their condition wor&s;e: And when they importuned him for a quick di&s;patch of the provi&s;ions for the <HI>Rochellers,</HI> the Duke of <HI>Buckingham</HI> u&s;ed no other excu&s;e to an&s;wer their &s;ollicitations, than that they were &s;old; and that which more amazed them, was his carrying a|way three hundred Tun of Corn, which he might have left them, till they could have been better &s;tored. But notwith&s;tan|ding all this, the Merchans addre&s;&s;ed them&s;elves to the King of <HI>England</HI> him&s;elf; to whom they repre&s;ented their imminent dan|ger, and the great preparations making to con&s;ummate their ruine; imploring his Maje&s;ty to favour them with a good and &s;peedy recruit of Victuals, that being the greate&s;t want that affli|cted them; which once &s;upplied, there was nothing el&s;e which they much feared: But if their enemies had lea&s;ure to block up their Port, their de&s;truction was inevitable: All which the King an&s;wered with promi&s;es of a powerful and &s;peedy relief, a&s;|&s;uring them moreover, that he would hazard all the Forces of his Kingdom, rather than &s;uffer them to peri&s;h.</P>
<P>While they expect the effect of the&s;e promi&s;es, the <HI>Rochel|lers</HI> di&s;patcht their Admiral <HI>Bragneau</HI> with money, and expre&s;s command to buy Corn, to lade both his own, and tho&s;e other &s;hips they had already in <HI>England,</HI> and to return with it with all &s;peed: <HI>David,</HI> who was &s;ent after him, with the like Com|mi&s;&s;ion, &s;tores his &s;hips with provi&s;ions, and very happily got back with them into <HI>Rochelle:</HI> But <HI>Bragneau,</HI> in&s;tead of execu|ting his Commi&s;&s;ion, goes directly from <HI>Plymouth,</HI> where all things were ready for him, to <HI>Port&s;mouth,</HI> under colour of fur|ni&s;hing him&s;elf at a better rate; and yet in&s;tead of doing that, goes to <HI>London,</HI> where puft up with vanity derived from the promi&s;es of the Duke of <HI>Buckingham,</HI> he minded nothing but an ambitious and covetous pur&s;uit of the honour and profit of the Admiralty of the refugiated <HI>French,</HI> which at length he ob|tained, by the voluntary demi&s;&s;ion of it, which the Duke of <HI>Soubize</HI> made of it, in favour of the <HI>Rochellers,</HI> and to ea&s;e them of the extraordinary expences they were at; and yet notwith|&s;tanding, all the in&s;tant, and dayly &s;ollicitations made to him to that purpo&s;e, could not induce him to be gone, till the difficulties of the pa&s;&s;age grew &s;o great, that he was at la&s;t forced to wait the departure of the other Fleet preparing for their relief.</P>
<P>This was the i&s;&s;ue of this expedition of the Duke of <HI>Bucking|ham,</HI> in which he wracked both his own and his Countreys ho|nor, con&s;umed much of the <HI>Rochellers</HI> provi&s;ions, and ruined the party he came to relieve.</P>
<PB N="153" REF="82">
<P>The hopes this Victory gave the King of carrying the Town, made him more intent upon the Siege: The whole winter he &s;pent in inve&s;ting it by Land with Forts, Redoubts, and lines of Communication, and &s;traightning it at Sea by a Bar extending from the point of <HI>Coreilles</HI> to <HI>Fort Lewis,</HI> in which he &s;pared nei|ther co&s;t nor pains.</P>
<P>The Bonfires the <HI>Romani&s;ts</HI> made throughout the whole Country of <HI>Foix,</HI> gave the Duke of <HI>Rohan</HI> the fir&s;t light of the&s;e misfortunes, the certainty of which was afterwards confirmed by an expre&s;s from the Duke of <HI>Soubize,</HI> who encouraged him &s;till with hopes that, the next Spring they &s;hould return in a condition to wipe off the &s;tains this affront had ca&s;t upon them.</P>
<P>At the &s;ame time the Duke of <HI>Rohan</HI> received two &s;everal Adverti&s;ements from the lower <HI>Languedoc;</HI> one was, that the Marque&s;s <HI>de Portes,</HI> who had many confederates in the <HI>Colle|que</HI> of <HI>Saint Germain,</HI> having corrupted the Gari&s;on in the Ca&s;tle of <HI>Florac,</HI> and gotten them to declare openly for him; <HI>Montredon,</HI> chief of the &s;aid <HI>Colloque,</HI> ha&s;ted thither, and cal|ling in the whole Province to his aide, had be&s;ieged the Ca&s;tle, and in &s;ight of the Marque&s;s <HI>de Portes,</HI> who was come with two thou&s;and men to relieve it, &s;prung two Mines, &s;tormed, and for|ced it to &s;urrender: The other was, that the Prince of <HI>Cond&eacute;</HI> was coming down the <HI>Rhone</HI> towards the lower <HI>Languedoc,</HI> and that <HI>Bri&s;on</HI> was in Treaty with him about the Province of <HI>Viva|retz,</HI> which he &s;ought by all means to intimidate; urging the Duke of <HI>Rohan</HI>'s ab&s;ence, and at &s;o great a di&s;tance from them as an argument to inforce his de&s;ign: This made him con&s;ider that it was be&s;t to pre&s;erve what they were already Ma&s;ters of; conceiving that if he wintered in <HI>Foix,</HI> he &s;hould bring a famine on the Countrey, which had already had but a bad year, and was &s;o little, and &s;o remote from their other quarters, that if the Prince of <HI>Cond&eacute;</HI> on one hand, and the Duke <HI>d' E&s;pernon</HI> on the other, &s;hould joyn with the Duke of <HI>Montmorency,</HI> he &s;hould be blocked up on all &s;ides: That if he went to <HI>Montauban</HI> it would be to &s;mall purpo&s;e, for that the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> were now gone, and the Winter was come on, and moreover that there was no po&s;&s;ibility for him to return thence again; &s;o that he conceived the &s;ecure&s;t way was, to return towards the lower <HI>Languedoc</HI> to oppo&s;e the Prince of <HI>Cond&eacute;</HI> there, and &s;o pre&s;erve that Coun|trey.</P>
<P>But before his departure, he convened the <HI>Colloque</HI> of <HI>Foix,</HI> &s;ettles <HI>Beaufort</HI> in the Government of it, to the great &s;atisfacti|on and joy of the Inhabitants; leaving with him his own Regi|ment

(which con&s;i&s;ted yet of eight hundred men) and his own Troop of light Hor&s;e-men; makes <HI>Rou&s;&s;eliere</HI> Governour of <HI>Sa|verdun;</HI> took order for the fortifying of &s;ome places, of which there were three very con&s;iderable, to wit <HI>Mazeres, Saverdun,</HI> and <HI>Carlat;</HI> and as for the <HI>Mas d' Azil,</HI> the good fortune they had to with&s;tand the former Siege, gave them courage again to &s;tand upon their defence.</P>
<P>The only perplexity he had was for <HI>Pamiez,</HI> being a great Town, not fortifiable, nor well peopled of it &s;elf; nor indeed were there enough of the Religion in all <HI>Foix</HI> to man it as it ought: The right cour&s;e had been to di&s;mantle it; but Men, with whom in Warres of &s;uch a nature a man mu&s;t of nece&s;&s;ity comply, are hardly per&s;waded to things of that kinde: But although this remedy could not be applied, yet he prevailed &s;o far upon the Inhabitants, as to fortifie a quarter of their Town called <HI>la Mar|cadal,</HI> very conveniently &s;eated, where he de&s;igned a hand&s;om fortification; which done he appoints his General Rendez-vous at <HI>Mazeres,</HI> whence he marches by night, and returning the &s;ame way he went, comes to <HI>Revel.</HI></P>
<P>The Duke of <HI>Montmorency</HI> having notice of his motion, goes to wait for him on the great Road to <HI>Montauban,</HI> whence he &s;uddenly retired again to his quarters. The Duke goes from <HI>Revel,</HI> to the higher <HI>Languedoc,</HI> where re-a&s;&s;embling the <HI>Colloque</HI> he informed them of all he had done in <HI>Foix;</HI> encourages them to a con&s;tant per&s;everance in their fidelity; and e&s;tabli&s;hes a Council for the direction of their affaires, untill &s;uch time, as he could &s;end them a Pre&s;ident for the <HI>Colloque,</HI> there being no man among them, that the re&s;t would give place to, for that the Marque&s;s of <HI>Malauze</HI> who had been formerly their Pre&s;i|dent, and would, without di&s;pute, have again been accepted of, was now wholly bent again&s;t their Party; the Court having pre|vailed &s;o farre upon him, as to make him oppo&s;e the Duke of <HI>Ro|han</HI> in that Province; which that he might the better do, he faines a de&s;ire to be reconciled with him, which he &s;ignifies by Letter to <HI>Beaufort;</HI> and afterwards, at his fir&s;t meeting with the Duke, di&s;covering &s;ome di&s;plea&s;ure, that <HI>Ca&s;tres</HI> was not yet joyned with the Party, prote&s;ted that as &s;oon as that Town, and <HI>Montauban,</HI> &s;hould do &s;o, and that a General A&s;&s;embly was for|med, he would al&s;o publiquely declare for them. This had a pe|&s;tilent influence on the weaker &s;ort, and gave the di&s;-affected among them, an opportunity to work much mi&s;chief among the people; For neither the Declarations of <HI>Montauban</HI> and <HI>Ca|&s;tres,</HI> nor the convening of a general A&s;&s;embly wrought any change at all in him, who continued &s;till an enemy to the Re|formed

<P>After this the Duke returns towards the <HI>Sevenes,</HI> and when he came to <HI>Vigan,</HI> received very urgent di&s;patches from <HI>Viva|retz,</HI> with intelligence that <HI>Bri&s;on</HI> had quitted all the higher <HI>Vi|varetz,</HI> upon the approach of the Prince of <HI>Cond&eacute;</HI> (although for want of Canon, he was not in a capacity to force the mo&s;t incon&s;iderable Fott there) who had burnt and pillaged that poor Countrey; and that, if they had not &s;peedy relief, it was to be feared that <HI>Privas,</HI> and the lower <HI>Vivaretz,</HI> would make their peace, to which <HI>Bri&s;on</HI> earne&s;tly incited them; but upon notice of the Duke's return, and that he was coming in per&s;on to their relief, they re-a&s;&s;umed their courages, and maugre all <HI>Bri&s;on</HI>'s di&s;&s;wa&s;ions, re&s;olved to &s;tand upon their guard; which obliged the Prince to pa&s;s into the lower <HI>Languedoc;</HI> whither when the Duke al&s;o came, he met with &s;ome Souldiers of <HI>Ni&s;mes,</HI> who had &s;eized the Ca&s;tle of <HI>Vauvert,</HI> which he cau&s;ed them to quit, upon the advance of the Prince, who &s;eemed to have an intenti|on to be&s;iege it; unwilling to give him any occa&s;ion to &s;top there, knowing that his orders were to pa&s;s into the higher <HI>Lan|guedoc,</HI> and that his &s;tay would prejudice a de&s;ign he had upon the Citadel of <HI>Montpellier,</HI> which <HI>Bretigny David,</HI> for &s;ix months together, had managed with the Baron <HI>de Me&s;lay,</HI> his Kin&s;man, and intimate friend; and elde&s;t Captaine of the Regiment of <HI>Normandy,</HI> then in Gari&s;on in <HI>Mont|pellier.</HI></P>
<P>Now, fora&s;mmch as upon the arrival of <HI>de Fo&s;&s;e,</HI> the Regi|ments of <HI>Normandy</HI> and <HI>Picardy</HI> were to be drawn out of the Town, and others to be placed there in their rooms; <HI>Me&s;lay</HI> who had there married one of the Religion, &s;eemed much di&s;|contented at this alteration; and that he had not left his own to embrace the Reformed Party: <HI>Bretigny,</HI> on the other &s;ide, who very well knew his ambition, cheri&s;hes him in this humour, and at length tells him, that if he could contrive a way to make him&s;elf Ma&s;ter of <HI>Montpellier,</HI> it would be then in his own power to make him&s;elf &s;atisfaction, and that withal he would be received into a Party, from which, by that means, he might obtaine whatever his own wi&s;hes could &s;ugge&s;t to his Hopes. The other li&s;tens to him, and demands time to con&s;ider both of
<PB N="156" REF="84">
the thing, and the means to effect it, and both together con|trived expedients for mutual Interviews, and conveying intelli|gence, without &s;u&s;pition, one to the other. Not long after he tells him he was now re&s;olved to undertake the bu&s;ine&s;s; Treats with him concerning the advantages and conditions he expected from the Reformed Party, and &s;hews him the way he had to make him&s;elf Ma&s;ter of the Citadel; to wit, that being on the Guard every fourth day with his own Company, he could, with much ea&s;e, let in as many as he plea&s;ed into it: That for a&s;&s;u|rance of his fidelity he would give his Wife in ho&s;tage; and when the de&s;ign was to be put in execution he would advance an hundred paces from the Citadel towards <HI>Bretigny,</HI> to yield him&s;elf up into his hands.</P>
<P>When all the&s;e things were communicated to the Duke of <HI>Rohan,</HI> he very well liked of them, for that the two lines of Communication, which conjoyned the Town with the Citadel, being made, and the Town Wall that &s;eparated them razed, as they were now at work upon it, the Town would not be able to defend it &s;elf; but withal he declared that he would never at|tempt this de&s;ign, till that Wall were down, or, at lea&s;t, great breaches were made in it, that &s;o one and the &s;ame action might put them in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion both of Town and Citadel. The de&s;ign thus concluded on, the Duke, for &s;ome dayes, deferres his march: But &s;eeing they proceeded too &s;lowly in rai&s;ing the Walls, he departs, and advancing a little way from <HI>Roque-Courbe</HI> to pa&s;s into <HI>Foix, Me&s;lay</HI> &s;ends <HI>Bretigny</HI> word, that the affaire was now in a very good po&s;ture, and that it was nece&s;&s;a|ry it &s;hould be put in execution, before the Gari&s;on in the Ci|tadel was changed; Whereupon he is di&s;patched into the <HI>Se|venes,</HI> and the lower <HI>Languedoc,</HI> with all nece&s;&s;ary in&s;tructions tending to the executing of the de&s;ign, and an expre&s;s charge particularly to impart it to <HI>Montredon,</HI> and to none el&s;e: But all was delayed till the arrival of the Duke of <HI>Rohan,</HI> to whom they then made new Propo&s;itions, that, at the &s;ame time the Citadel &s;hould be attempted without, he &s;hould &s;torm the Town with two thou&s;and Men, and al&s;o &s;cale the Walls of Communi|cation, alledging, that when they &s;hould be Ma&s;ters of the Ci|tadel, the time they mu&s;t have to pa&s;s three or four thou&s;and Men, through one gate, would give the Town too much lea&s;ure to arm them&s;elves. This made him &s;omewhat more cold in the bu&s;ine&s;s, and gave him great &s;u&s;picions of the treachery inten|ded; whereupon he continued firm in his former re&s;olution; in &s;o much as <HI>Bretigny</HI> complained that he found him &s;o refractory in a bu&s;ine&s;s able to revive their drooping Party: But he de|mon&s;trated
<PB N="157" REF="84">
to him the danger of this la&s;t propo&s;al, and that being once Ma&s;ter of the Citadel, nothing could hinder his taking of the Town al&s;o.</P>
<P>While the Prince of <HI>Cond&eacute;</HI> was upon his March towards the higher <HI>Languedoc,</HI> the Duke of <HI>Rohan</HI> Rallies his Forces, ap|pointing the Rendez-vous to be on the 19th. of <HI>January</HI> a little above <HI>Claret,</HI> five leagues from <HI>Montpellier;</HI> where about two of the clock in the Afternoon, there met &s;ix thou&s;and fighting men: Thence he &s;ent a party of Hor&s;e to advance before the re&s;t of the Army, as far as the Bridge of <HI>Sale&s;on,</HI> which is about a league from <HI>Montpellier,</HI> to intercept all &s;uch as might give any notice of his approach: And then commands <HI>Bretigny,</HI> chief of the enterpri&s;e, to march with the Van, con&s;i&s;ting of fifteen hun|dred Men, and divided into fix Squadrons; the three fir&s;t were compo&s;ed each one of thirty armed men, called out of the Vo|luntiers, and out of the be&s;t of the Cavalry, with Halberds and Pi&s;tols; and of four&s;core others, half-Pikes, half-Mu&s;quitiers; every ten armed Men had their Officer, and carried with them Petardes, and Ladders, to force the Court of Guard in the Citadel; and two great Forks to keep up the Portcullis; the o|ther three Troops were compo&s;ed of four hundred men, each one; and were ordered for a Re&s;erve to the other: After the&s;e, marched the Duke with his Men at Armes, followed by all the other Squadrons, the bigge&s;t of which con&s;i&s;ted not of above four, or five hundred men. When they came to the Bridge of <HI>Sale&s;on,</HI> they found there the Baron <HI>de Me&s;lay</HI>'s <HI>Man,</HI> who a&s;|&s;ured <HI>Bretigny</HI> that all went well; whereupon, leaving all their Baggage on the other &s;ide of the Bridge of <HI>Sale&s;on,</HI> with a hun|dred Souldiers only to guard it, they advance as far as the Bridge called <HI>Juvenal,</HI> which is about a Canon &s;hot from <HI>Montpellier: Bretigny,</HI> by a bold Souldier, gives notice of his arrival to his Cou&s;in, who &s;o well knew how to fool him, that he returned with an a&s;&s;urance that all was well, and in a good condition, and that there was no difficulty in the matter: Whereupon he proceeds, not minding at all what had been &s;o often recommended to him, not to enter the place untill <HI>Me&s;lay</HI> was come forth to him, and had put him&s;elf into his hands; but his impatient de&s;ire to execute &s;o brave a de&s;ign, animates him, without this precaution, to enter the Citadel with &s;ix or &s;even and thirty men; tho&s;e within not daring to let any more come in: For as &s;oon, as they &s;aw them plant their Forks to &s;upport the Portcullis, they cut a cord, by which means the Bridge was drawn up, and a Trap-door opened, whence mo&s;t of tho&s;e that were gotten in, fell down into a Trench, where they were all harque-bu&s;iered, the Mu&s;quitiers at the &s;ame

time playing on tho&s;e without; <HI>Montredon,</HI> who in <HI>Bretigny</HI>'s ab&s;ence was to command, and had received a charge to be at the Gate, and &s;ee them all enter in good order, drew off the Troops, and gave the Duke notice of their &s;ucce&s;s, who had drawn up his whole Body in Battaila on the right, and left hand of the great Road-way, which he had left open for the retreat of tho&s;e of the Van; who when they were all pa&s;&s;ed, he returned to the Bridge of <HI>Sale&s;on,</HI> where making an Halt, he Rallied his Men, and then drew off into the Plains between <HI>Montpellier,</HI> and <HI>Lunel,</HI> quar|tering his Men in the be&s;t Villages thereabouts; not any one &s;tir|ring out of <HI>Montpellier</HI> to pur&s;ue him, or ob&s;erve his March. The next day he gave leave to the Troops, that came from the <HI>Se|venes</HI> to depart; and marched with tho&s;e of the lower <HI>Langue|doc,</HI> to <HI>Saint Gilles,</HI> where he thought to have made an attempt upon that Garri&s;on, but the violence of the cold forced him to &s;end his Men into quarters.</P>
<P>This was the i&s;&s;ue of that enterpri&s;e, in which <HI>Bretigny,</HI> and his brother were &s;lain, with about twenty others, and &s;ixteen or &s;eventeen more were taken pri&s;oners.</P>
<P>This Winter was the Duke of <HI>Rohan</HI> hardly pre&s;&s;ed both in the upper <HI>Languedoc,</HI> and in <HI>Vivaretz;</HI> in the former of which was the Prince of <HI>Cond&eacute;;</HI> who whil'&s;t he prepared to invade the Province by open force, endeavoured al&s;o by &s;ecret practices to undermine the con&s;tancy of tho&s;e Towns that had declared for the Reformed Party; &s;o that the Duke of <HI>Rohans</HI> pre&s;ence there, with his Forces, was ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary: And on the other &s;ide <HI>Vivaretz,</HI> &s;ince the Prince his March through it, was in a mi&s;e|rable condition; the higher <HI>Vivaretz</HI> being lo&s;t, with all that the Duke held upon the <HI>Rhone:</HI> And be&s;ides all this, the Duke of <HI>Ventadour</HI> in his Seigniories, and <HI>Me&s;&s;argues</HI> in tho&s;e he held in right of his Wife, u&s;ed extream cruelties, and violences a|gain&s;t tho&s;e of the Religion, &s;eizing on their E&s;tates, torturing their Bodies with Whips, and Ba&s;tinadoes, driving them to Ma&s;&s;e; &s;o that there came thence, to the Duke, frequent di&s;|patches, and Deputies, one upon the heels of another, to im|plore his pre&s;ence, and the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of his Forces, to re&s;tore them to their liberty, which otherwi&s;e they &s;hould be inforced to purcha&s;e at any rate; con&s;idering al&s;o the divi&s;ions between all the Nobility of that Countrey, and <HI>Bri&s;on;</HI> a&s;&s;uring him al&s;o that they had taken care for the quartering of his Troops, as long as their nece&s;&s;ity &s;hould require their &s;tay there.</P>
<P>There happened yet another accident, which much ob&s;truct|ed this Voyage; to wit, the unexpected death of <HI>Bri&s;on,</HI> which
<PB N="159" REF="85">
much enlarged the former divi&s;ions; for if the Nobility refu&s;ed to &s;ubmit to <HI>Bri&s;on,</HI> who had been already twice Governour of the Province, much more would they oppo&s;e his brother <HI>Chev|ricles,</HI> a young man, of &s;mall experience, and far &s;hort of his brothers conduct to govern the Province: On the other &s;ide the faction of <HI>Bri&s;on,</HI> which was the mo&s;t prevalent in <HI>Privas,</HI> and <HI>Privas</HI> the mo&s;t con&s;iderable place of all <HI>Vivaretz,</HI> cho&s;e <HI>Chev|rilles</HI> for their Governour; for that, being con&s;cious of his weakne&s;s, they thought to rule all more ab&s;olutely, than under his brother, and to allow him what part they plea&s;ed, in the ad|mini&s;tration of the Affairs: To which mu&s;t be added, that the Province of the lower <HI>Languedoc,</HI> which was to advance the Lea|vy-money, being highly intere&s;&s;ed in the pre&s;ervation of <HI>Viva|retz,</HI> and blocking up the <HI>Rhone,</HI> it being a River that with great facility and &s;peed could convey all &s;orts of Arms, and Am|munition to the enemy, preferred this de&s;ign, before that of the higher <HI>Languedoc;</HI> for which place <HI>Rohan</HI> had rai&s;ed two Re|giments, of five hundred Men apiece, which was all they de&s;ired, in ca&s;e he could not come him&s;elf in per&s;on: But the untoward humour of <HI>Faucon,</HI> to &s;ay no wor&s;e, much retarded this relief; for being de&s;igned for that expedition, after he had promi&s;ed to go, and for that rea&s;on had received more Advance-money than was u&s;ually allowed; he endeavoured to corrupt his Captains, that &s;o he might reject his merited blame on them; but being not able to prevail on more than one, he was at length con&s;trained to declare openly that he would not go at all; &s;o that the Duke could &s;end but eight of tho&s;e Companies with <HI>Caumette-Cham|baud,</HI> who commanded the other Regiment: But by rea&s;on of the&s;e difficulties, protractions, and the artifices u&s;ed by <HI>Faucon</HI> to withdraw both Officer, and Souldier from this Voyage, tho&s;e eight Companies could never amount to more than eight hundred men in the whole. The Duke thereupon cau&s;ed <HI>Faucon</HI> to be &s;ecured, and tryed at a Councel of War, where he found more favour, than ju&s;tice. 'Tis one of the greate&s;t calamities that attend the Generals of Parties poor, and compo&s;ed of Volunta|ries only, that they have no capacity either to reward the Noble, or puni&s;h degenerous and unworthy actions.</P>
<P>But to return to the Voyage of <HI>Vivaretz:</HI> The Duke of <HI>Ro|han</HI> rai&s;es four thou&s;and Foot, and about two hundred Hor&s;e: But before he began his March thither, di&s;mantles <HI>Saint Geniez,</HI> and other &s;mall places upon the River <HI>Gardon,</HI> within the Dio|ce&s;s of <HI>V&s;ez,</HI> le&s;t the <HI>Romani&s;ts,</HI> in his ab&s;ence, &s;hould po&s;&s;e&s;s them&s;elves of them, and by &s;mall Garri&s;ons take off the contri|bution of all that Country which was full of good Towns; and

<P>When he had taken this cour&s;e, he comes about the begin|ning of <HI>March,</HI> with all his Forces to <HI>Aletz,</HI> where he was &s;ol|licited (even to a &s;edition) by the Inhabitants, to employ his Forces in taking in of <HI>Vezenobre,</HI> and <HI>Monts,</HI> two Garri&s;ons that incommoded them; but having cleared him&s;elf of this impor|tunity, he advanced. His fir&s;t work was to &s;ecure the Ca&s;tle of <HI>Rou&s;&s;on,</HI> lying between <HI>Aletz,</HI> and <HI>Saint Ambroix;</HI> and after|wards, in his March, takes in <HI>Tharque,</HI> and <HI>Saint John de Marne &s;ols,</HI> two places belonging to the Marque&s;s <HI>de Portes,</HI> which yielded at &s;ight of his Canon; the latter of the&s;e he di&s;mantled, but not the former, being but a &s;mall Ca&s;tle, and the u&s;ual re&s;idence of the &s;aid Marque&s;s: Having cleared his way as far as <HI>Bariac,</HI> and being now upon the Confines of <HI>Vivaretz,</HI> he thought it nece&s;&s;a|ry to &s;ecure a Pa&s;s upon the River <HI>Ardache,</HI> for the advantage both of his advance and return. To this end he be&s;ieged the Ca&s;tle of <HI>Salvas,</HI> &s;ituate on that River, which he blocked up with part of his Forces, whiles the other part, under the command of <HI>Au|bais,</HI> pa&s;&s;ed the River, both for the convenience of quarters, and provi&s;ions, as al&s;o that at the &s;ame time he might block up the Ca&s;tle of <HI>Valon</HI> al&s;o: The Siege of <HI>Salvas</HI> la&s;ted five dayes; for that the Canon, and other nece&s;&s;aries, to force it &s;uddenly, were not yet come up; &s;o that they contented them&s;elves with breaking &s;ome of their Out-works, and then had recour&s;e to two Mines which they &s;prung, and to good effect too; the ba&s;e Court being taken, the Garri&s;on retreated to the Tower, which was &s;tormed on every &s;ide: Tho&s;e within behaved them&s;elves brave|ly, killed and wounded many of the A&s;&s;ailants, and among o|thers, the Colonel <HI>Goudin</HI> was hurt; but the Canon came up, and did &s;uch execution on them, that they were con&s;trained to yield the next day after the a&s;&s;ault.</P>
<P>Their example drew the Tower <HI>de Moulins,</HI> and the Ca&s;tle of <HI>Valon</HI> al&s;o to a &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion: The Duke cau&s;ed the two Ca&s;tles to be razed, pre&s;erving only the Tower of <HI>Moulins,</HI> which of it &s;elf was &s;trong, and tenable by a &s;mall Garri&s;on. To &s;ecure this pa&s;s, and clear all the way of <HI>Vivaretz,</HI> there remained only <HI>Ville-neufve de Berg,</HI> where the Governour <HI>Montreal</HI> had gotten together twelve hundred men; but notwith&s;tanding that, the Duke was re&s;olved, had it been po&s;&s;ible, to attempt it; that
<PB N="161" REF="86">
&s;o he might not leave any thorns behinde him: But he wanted Ammunition, having &s;pent his &s;mall &s;tore at the Siege of <HI>Salvas;</HI> where the &s;carcity of provi&s;ions, and the nearne&s;s of &s;ome of his men to their own homes, had much dimini&s;hed his Forces; and, which was wor&s;e, &s;o little care had the Province taken in it, that there was nothing for them about <HI>Ville-neufve,</HI> &s;o that he was fain to leave his Canon at <HI>Gorce,</HI> and for conveniency of quar|ters, to March with all his Troops to <HI>Privas,</HI> the Countrey ha|ving not had the lea&s;t thought of any thing, but how to retort the blame of their want of Provi&s;ions one upon another, &s;o that he had much ado to keep together tho&s;e Souldiers he had left. The fir&s;t exploit after his arrival in the Province of <HI>Vivaretz</HI> was the Siege of <HI>Choumerarg,</HI> performed by <HI>Chevrilles,</HI> and the Country Troops, whil'&s;t his own refre&s;hed them&s;elves; it la&s;ted three dayes, and then their Works being all battered, the place was yielded on the &s;econd of <HI>April.</HI></P>
<P>The Duke of <HI>Rohan</HI>'s de&s;igns in <HI>Vivaretz,</HI> were to place a Governour, and to compo&s;e all the divi&s;ions there; but principal|ly to &s;ecure a good pa&s;s upon the <HI>Rhone,</HI> both to draw the Tribute of the River to him&s;elf, and to facilitate the March of tho&s;e For|ces which the Duke of <HI>Savoy</HI> had promi&s;ed him: For which end &s;ome propo&s;ed to him <HI>Sojon,</HI> others <HI>la Voute,</HI> others <HI>Bajes,</HI> and <HI>Pou&s;in;</HI> the inconvenience of the fir&s;t was its &s;ituation, being in the higher <HI>Vivaretz,</HI> and &s;o remote from <HI>Privas,</HI> that it could not be ea&s;ily removed from thence; that of the &s;econd was, that it was a place belonging to the Duke of <HI>Ventadour,</HI> and being of it &s;elf weak, and not capable to be made good, would drain <HI>Privas</HI> of all its Ammunition, and con&s;equently draw an affront upon that place, which would ruine his reputation, both with the adver&s;e Party, and his own too: Wherefore he pitches on the latter, and begins with <HI>Pou&s;in,</HI> which when <HI>Bri&s;on</HI> gave it up, was di&s;mantled; but, to prevent our re-po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing of it, the ene|my had fortified a &s;mall Tower in the Ca&s;tle, and rai&s;ed a little Triangular Fort upon the Rivers &s;ide; he commanded <HI>Aubais</HI> by night, to po&s;&s;e&s;s him&s;elf of that part of the Suburbs which lies to|wards <HI>Lauport;</HI> and <HI>Leques</HI> at the &s;ame time to enter the Town: In the mean time he drew his Canon, whereupon the Fort was given up; but chiefly for that <HI>Leques</HI> had already taken the Tower, and from the advantages of it, and the Ca&s;tle, played &s;o furiou&s;ly into the Fort, that none dur&s;t &s;tir to &s;hew him&s;elf in it.</P>

to po&s;&s;e&s;s him&s;elf of the Town of <HI>Bajes,</HI> to &s;ecure it with Bar|ricadoes, and &s;eize on all the Boats in the Port, which he happi|ly effected: This done, <HI>Aubais</HI> received command to attempt the two Ca&s;tles of <HI>Bajes,</HI> which after their di&s;mantling, had been again repaired; but upon the approach of the Canon, yielded: Which done, the Duke taking into his con&s;ideration the &s;ituation of both places, conceived that of <HI>Pou&s;in</HI> to be the mo&s;t conve|nient, both for the facility of being fortified, and the advantage it had to command the River; thither then he commanded to be brought all the Boats, and &s;ent <HI>Leques</HI> with twelve hundred men into <HI>Dauphine,</HI> which brought &s;o great a terrour on them, that many Towns &s;ent him in voluntary contributions of Corn, Meal, and Bread, which was a great relief to his men, whom the avarice, and di&s;affection of <HI>Privas</HI> had expo&s;ed to great extre|mities; and, that he might lo&s;e no time, &s;ets about the Fortifi|cations, to which the Countrey contributed &s;o little, that he was fain to make Collections among his own Officers to pay the Soul|diers that wrought in them.</P>
<P>The Duke, during his abode here, &s;ollicites tho&s;e of the Religion in <HI>Dauphine</HI> to joyn with him; but in vain, the Count of <HI>Soi&s;&s;ons</HI> amu&s;ing them with hopes that he would &s;hortly appear him&s;elf in the head of them; whereupon he &s;ent the Count &s;ome overtures to joyn with him, with four thou&s;and Foot, and three hundred Hor&s;e in any part of <HI>Dauphine,</HI> he &s;hould plea&s;e to ap|point; and that if he would bring but as many, he would engage him&s;elf in a &s;hort time to make him Ma&s;ter of the greate&s;t part of <HI>Dauphine;</HI> but he had no other return than empty words, and com|plementary thanks, which made him think that the Count had rather make an inglorious peace with tho&s;e he declared to be his enemies, than engage in an honourable War again&s;t them.</P>
<P>Whil'&s;t he &s;tayed at <HI>Pou&s;in,</HI> he al&s;o received intelligence from the Duke of <HI>Soubize</HI> by <HI>Carlincas,</HI> that the Fleet de&s;igned to bring the Corn to <HI>Rochelle,</HI> would be there towards the latter end of <HI>May;</HI> but the other, from which they expected their en|tire deliverance, not till after the Harve&s;t. <HI>Chevrilles,</HI> who &s;aw the &s;treights the Duke of <HI>Rohan</HI>'s Forces were in, for want of pro|vi&s;ions, propo&s;es him to an attempt upon <HI>Cheilard,</HI> a &s;mall Town, belonging to the Duke of <HI>Ventadour,</HI> and &s;eated upon the Confines of <HI>Vellay;</HI> It has large Suburbs, and a Ca&s;tle, that commands them: All the Inhabitants of this, and the neigh|bouring places, are of the Religion, and till now had been &s;e|verely per&s;ecuted by their Lord, even in times of peace; in order to the effecting of this de&s;ign, he demands of him two Regi|ments, which were granted him: The Town he took with Pe|tardes,

and with the two afore&s;aid Regiments inve&s;ted a Ca&s;tle, called <HI>La Chez&eacute;</HI> which is about a Canon-&s;hot di&s;tant from <HI>Chei|lard,</HI> and upon the &s;ight of two Faucons that were drawn up to it, was given up; with the&s;e Gunnes he begins to play upon the Works of the Ca&s;tle of <HI>Cheilard;</HI> but the Pieces being not &s;ufficient for Battery, he was fain to &s;end to <HI>Privas</HI> for &s;ome bigger.</P>
<P>During this Siege, the Duke had intelligence from all parts, of the Duke of <HI>Montmorency</HI>'s arrival in the higher <HI>Languedoc,</HI> who rai&s;ed all the Forces he could to &s;et upon him in his Marches, or to cut off his pa&s;&s;age by taking <HI>Barjac:</HI> This newes made him re&s;olve, no longer to defer his return; wherefore he writes to <HI>Chevrilles,</HI> that in ca&s;e the Ca&s;tle of <HI>Cheilard</HI> was not taken by a day, which he prefixed, he &s;hould &s;end back the two Regiments; which &s;o quickned his diligence in the enterpri&s;e, that the place was taken within the time limited him: And the Duke having gi|ven order for the razing of all the places he had taken, except <HI>Pou&s;in;</HI> and left <HI>Chevrilles</HI> in a firm po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his Govern|ment, &s;ets out from <HI>Privas</HI> upon <HI>Ea&s;ter</HI> day, and encamps that night below <HI>Mirabel;</HI> and as he was marching thence the next Morning by break of day, <HI>Aubais,</HI> that led the Van, informed him that the enemy appeared, both Hor&s;e and Foot, about <HI>Saint Germain,</HI> a large Town, indifferently well fortified, and di&s;tant about a quarter of a league from <HI>Ville-neufve;</HI> whence they al|&s;o drew out fre&s;h Souldiers: They were all the forces that <HI>Ven|tadour</HI> and <HI>Montreall</HI> could make in that Countrey, which alarmed not the Duke at all, while he was employed about tho&s;e &s;mall Sieges. They made choice of that place, as the mo&s;t ad|vantageous for them, the pa&s;&s;age being &s;trait, and the Dukes For|ces of nece&s;&s;ity to pa&s;s within a Mu&s;quet &s;hot of the Town, the pa&s;&s;ages to which, were very commodious to lodge Mu&s;quetiers in: But the Duke of <HI>Montmorency,</HI> being half a dayes March &s;hort of them, they only made a little skirmi&s;h, which made the Duke of <HI>Rohan</HI> de&s;irous to pur&s;ue them, and force the Town, which he might have done, but was happily di&s;&s;waded from it, le&s;t the Duke of <HI>Montmorency</HI> with his fre&s;h Forces &s;hould &s;urprize him, while he was engaged, which would certainly have happened; for he came to <HI>Ville-neufve</HI> about two houres after they had got|ten over the pa&s;s, which was done with very good conduct and order; in this Rencontre there were &s;ome &s;lain, and wounded on both &s;ides: After this no enemy appeared; but the Duke when he came to <HI>Gorce,</HI> took his Canon, which he drew back to <HI>An|duze,</HI> where he gave his Troops &s;ome refre&s;hment, which they ve|ry much wanted.</P>

<P>Mean while the Prince of <HI>Cond&eacute;</HI> and the Duke of <HI>Montmo|rency</HI> joyning their Forces take the field, and march into <HI>Foix</HI> to attempt <HI>Pamiez,</HI> a great Town, but of no &s;trength: The ill de&s;tiny of <HI>Beaufort</HI> impelled him to a re&s;olution of defending it; to which end he calls in all his own, and mo&s;t of the Forces of the Countrey; but, a breach being made, their confu&s;ion was too great to give them leave to think of any further re&s;i&s;tance; tho&s;e that were fal&s;e among them, u&s;ing all means to augment the others fear: <HI>Beaufort</HI> &s;eeing this di&s;order, endeavoured to &s;ave him&s;elf by flight, together with <HI>Anros,</HI> but they were both taken, carried to <HI>Thoulou&s;e,</HI> and there put to death: The town was pillaged, and all manner of licentious cruelties imaginable from Souldiers under &s;uch a Commander, were exerci&s;ed in it: The taking of this Town much di&s;mayed the whole Countrey, where no place e&s;caped the attempts either of threats, or promi|&s;es; but the courage and fidelity of <HI>Rou&s;&s;eliere,</HI> whom the Duke of <HI>Rohan</HI> had made Governour of <HI>Saverdun,</HI> together with his &s;edulous indu&s;try to encourage others pre&s;erved the Province; and the Prince marched back, with his Army, into the upper <HI>Lan|guedoc:</HI> Then was the Duke of <HI>Montmorency</HI> fain to return to <HI>Vivaretz,</HI> to the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of his Parti&s;ans there; and the Duke of <HI>Rohan</HI> was with no le&s;s in&s;tances &s;ollicited by the higher <HI>Langue|doc,</HI> to the &s;ame purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>The Prince his fir&s;t exploit was the Siege of <HI>Realmont,</HI> a Town who&s;e &s;ituation rendred it very con&s;iderable; well &s;tored with Souldiers, and all &s;orts of Provi&s;ions, and which might have held out much longer, and very well expected the relief preparing for it: But neither did he begin the &s;iege, till he had Treated with <HI>Maugis</HI> who was Governour of it; who, having corrupted the fir&s;t Con&s;ul, the Colonel <HI>Chaumette,</HI> and his Sergeant Major, and made &s;ome &s;hew of oppo&s;ition for ten or twelve dayes, without any breach made, or con&s;ulting with his Captains, or the people, contrary to the Oaths they were mu|tually engaged in, at the enemies fir&s;t coming before it, not &s;o much as to make the lea&s;t mention of &s;urrendring, enters into a Capitulation, &s;ignes it, and pre&s;ents it to the Town; who re|fu&s;ing to approve of it, he lets in the Be&s;iegers at a Port, which was at his own devotion, whiles the re&s;t were every one at their re&s;pective po&s;ts; &s;o that great was the confu&s;ion there, and though by the Capitulation the Defendants ought to have mar|ched off with their armes, yet was that violated, and they di&s;|armed, <HI>Sigalon,</HI> and <HI>Huguet,</HI> two of <HI>Chaumett</HI>'s Captains, with &s;ome other hone&s;t Inhabitants of the place, maintained a <HI>Basti|on,</HI> re&s;olutely declaring to the World, that they had rather dye

than quit their armes, which they carryed off, and with them as much honour due to their bravery, as the others did infamy, me|rited by their ba&s;ene&s;s. Great were the mi&s;eries of this poor Town, whence Men, and Women &s;tript, and without any o|ther covering than their di&s;chevelled haire, came to <HI>Roque-Courbe;</HI> where <HI>Saint Germier,</HI> and <HI>L' Espuguet,</HI> who had the conduct of the affairs of tho&s;e of the Reformed Party in tho&s;e parts, by means of the Corre&s;pondents they had in <HI>Ca&s;tres,</HI> made u&s;e of this Barbari&s;me to provoke the people to an In&s;urrection, which had &s;o pro&s;perous an event, that notwith&s;tanding the op|po&s;ition of the Pre&s;ident <HI>Montespieu,</HI> of the Advocate Gene|ral, the Con&s;uls, and their adherents, the Walls were &s;caled, and the Town without the effu&s;ion of any blood taken, and the Pre&s;ident, and the Advocate bani&s;hed thence. <HI>Chavagnac</HI> at the &s;ame time came very opportunely into the Countrey, &s;ent thither by the Duke of <HI>Rohan</HI> to command in chief there, where he was received, and, even in <HI>Castres</HI> it &s;elf, with an univer&s;al Joy.</P>
<P>For be&s;ides the delight all Novelties u&s;ually bring with them, the pre&s;ent &s;tate of affaires required a Governour; otherwi&s;e the Prince had carried all the Mountain of <HI>Albigeois</HI> before him; whereas now the greate&s;t mi&s;chief &s;uffered there was the lo&s;s of <HI>Cauve,</HI> which the Marque&s;s of <HI>Malauze</HI> cau&s;ed to be delivered up to him, in which place, contrary to his promi&s;e, he left a Gari&s;on: After this he made an offer at <HI>Viane,</HI> blocked it up, and rai&s;ed a battery again&s;t it; but &s;eeing that neither his threats nor promi&s;es made any impre&s;&s;ion on the Be&s;ieged, and that the Governour <HI>E&s;eroux,</HI> and <HI>A&s;&s;as,</HI> whom the Duke of <HI>Ro|han</HI> had &s;ent thither with four hundred men, &s;eemed to be &s;uch as would give him a &s;mart oppo&s;ition, he rai&s;ed his &s;iege; and thence goes to attempt <HI>Ca&s;telnau</HI> and <HI>Bra&s;&s;ac,</HI> places of no &s;trength, but &s;urpri&s;eable even by unarmed men; Neverthe|le&s;s the former gave him the trouble to draw down his Canon, where the ob&s;tinacy of &s;ome, occa&s;ioned the lo&s;s of forty or fifty good Souldiers, who cho&s;e rather to &s;ubmit to all extremities, than to ob&s;erve the Orders given them by <HI>Chavagnac,</HI> to draw off as &s;oon as they &s;aw the Enemies Canon, which they might have ea&s;ily done: This done, the Prince, not daring any more to look towards <HI>Viane,</HI> &s;ends <HI>Linas</HI> to <HI>Saint Sever,</HI> a place of which he him&s;elf was Lord, to per&s;wade the Inhabitants to &s;ub|mit before he drew down his Canon; but &s;eeing how ineffectual all his per&s;wa&s;ions proved, he &s;tayes there with them; where, after they had endured many Volleys of Canon &s;hot, them&s;elves made a breach in the Wall, and e&s;caped by night.

<P>But before we pa&s;s into the higher <HI>Languedoc,</HI> it will be ex|pedient that we &s;peak a word or two of <HI>Montauban:</HI> This Town, though it was then governed by Con&s;uls, and other Magi&s;trates that were great Enemies to the Reformed Party, had neverthe|le&s;s great inclinations to joyn with them: This, the Duke of <HI>Ro|han</HI> him&s;elf at fir&s;t hindred, being not willing they &s;hould de|clare before he came to them; and when after his return from the voyage of <HI>Foix,</HI> he de&s;ired them &s;o to do, nothing ob&s;tructed it, but their want of a Governour: Whereupon the be&s;t part of the Town ca&s;ting their eyes upon <HI>Saint Michel,</HI> a younger bro|ther of <HI>La Roche Chalais,</HI> and of Kin to the Duke of <HI>Rohan,</HI> who applauded their choice, they received him into their Town about <HI>May,</HI> and there, after that <HI>de Bergues,</HI> and <HI>Saint Foy,</HI> through many difficulties, and great dangers, had conducted thither, from the lower <HI>Guienne,</HI> four&s;core, or an hundred Hor&s;e, and <HI>Viant</HI> a Company of Foot, and that he had all his nece&s;&s;ary Provi&s;ions ready, on the four and twentieth day of <HI>June,</HI> they put him in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his Command. The fir&s;t thing he did, was to order all things in a Militiary way; rai&s;ing a Regiment compo&s;ed of Voluntiers, &s;uch as had A&s;yled them&s;elves there; and inrolling al&s;o in the e&s;tabli&s;hment, tho&s;e Hor&s;e that <HI>de Bergues</HI> had brought thither.</P>
<P>But before he could well &s;ettle him&s;elf in his authority he met with many rubbs, having for enemies, not only tho&s;e that were of a contrary Party, but, even among his own, many rivals for the place, who under-hand did him many ill Offices: Some of the&s;e he &s;urmounted by prudence and di&s;&s;imulation; and to o|thers he was fain to apply open force, and the extremity of rigor: The mo&s;t eminent example of which, was occa&s;ioned by three young Souldiers, Natives of the Town, who&s;e names were <HI>Car|ti&eacute;, La Fore&s;t,</HI> and <HI>Brete,</HI> who di&s;gu&s;ted at a denial of &s;ome Offices they &s;ued fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">; or el&s;e &s;et on by &s;ome others, envious of his honour, entred into a con&s;piracy again&s;t his per&s;on, and to compa&s;s their de&s;ign make a Party in the Town, to which they drew in many Giddy braines, and among them &s;ome of quality, as the &s;onnes of the Advocate <HI>Clerk,</HI> and the Coun&s;ellour <HI>de la Ro&s;e,</HI> which gave greater &s;u&s;pitions that this bu&s;ine&s;s was fo|mented by other per&s;ons, who, though they appeared not at all in it, yet were they the principal Agents. The pretence of this conjuration was the publique liberty, by which means having rai&s;ed many of the people, they &s;hew them&s;elves in the head of them, with their Swords and Pi&s;tols in their hands, and in that
<PB N="167" REF="89">
equipage march to the Governours quarters, crying out <HI>Liber|ty, Liberty!</HI> and that it was high time to rid them&s;elves of tho&s;e that oppre&s;&s;ed it: When they came near to his door, they were &s;topped by &s;ome of his guard, who &s;o gallantly behaved them|&s;elves in the defence of it, that they killed five or &s;ix of the Mu|tiniers, and among others <HI>Clerk,</HI> and <HI>La Ro&s;&s;e:</HI> The tumult &s;preading it &s;elf in the Town, the Con&s;uls, with a great num|ber of the Inhabitants, ha&s;te down to the Governours; to whom when <HI>Saint Michel</HI> had recounted the Action, and ju&s;tified the procedure of his Souldiers, all were well &s;atisfied; and the Con|&s;uls cau&s;ing the &s;aid <HI>Cartie, La Fore&s;t,</HI> and <HI>Brete,</HI> Authours of the &s;edition to be apprehended, they were tryed, and condem|ned by the Council of Warre, which in favour of their re|lations in the Town, in&s;tead of hanging, cau&s;ed them to be &s;hot to death.</P>
<P><HI>Saint Michel,</HI> whom this example of Ju&s;tice had now fixed in his authority, thinks of enlarging his quarters; and conceiving him&s;elf &s;trong enough in Souldiers, by rea&s;on of tho&s;e that were fled thither for &s;helter, he undertook to put the Town of <HI>Cua&s;ade</HI> in a po&s;ture of defence; and having put <HI>Chastillon</HI> a Gentleman of <HI>Angoulmois</HI> with eight hundred good men into it, he u&s;ed &s;uch diligence in his fortifications, that in a very &s;hort &s;pace the place was made tenable; This the Prince, and the Duke <HI>d' E&s;pernon</HI> had intended to be&s;iege, but were diverted by the Siege of <HI>Cre&s;eil,</HI> which drew away the Prince with his Forces, &s;o that the Duke <HI>d' E&s;pernon</HI> was unwilling to engage alone in the Siege, but endeavoured to contrive &s;ome intelligences, and cor|re&s;pondencies within, that might help him to &s;urprize it, in which even the Mini&s;ter of that Church, who&s;e name was <HI>Le Grand,</HI> who had de&s;erted it in the very beginning of the trou|bles, was his great A&s;&s;i&s;tant, informing him of the condition of the Town, and per&s;wading him, as much as in him lay, to at|tempt it; but finding his de&s;ign not fei&s;ible that way, he conten|ted him&s;elf only with an a&s;&s;ault, which he cau&s;ed to be made on the out-works, where he was &s;o generou&s;ly received, that, leaving many dead upon the place, and &s;ome Gari&s;ons in the adjacent Towns, he drew away again.</P>
<P>But return we now to the Duke of <HI>Rohan,</HI> who, from the be|ginning of the Siege of <HI>Realmont,</HI> was extreamly importuned to relieve it, for which he was diligently preparing him&s;elf; but after it was taken, he was as earne&s;tly &s;ollicited to march towards the higher <HI>Languedoc,</HI> &s;o that there pa&s;&s;ed not a week in which he received not two or three di&s;patches, to that effect: On the o|ther &s;ide he found he &s;hould have much ado to gaine his Soul|diers

<P>In this interval, the Duke of <HI>Rohan</HI> had notice of what became of the &s;econd Fleet, which was di&s;patched from <HI>England,</HI> to &s;upply <HI>Rochelle</HI> with provi&s;ions, untill the greater, de&s;igned for its entire deliverance, could be made ready. The &s;tory is this, The Duke of <HI>Soubize,</HI> &s;econded by the Deputies, and Merchants of <HI>Rochelle</HI> that were then in <HI>England,</HI> urges the King with &s;uch earne&s;t and a&s;&s;iduous importunities, that he re|&s;olved upon the victualling of <HI>Rochelle;</HI> for which, when all things were in a readine&s;s, the Duke of <HI>Buckingham</HI> offered him the command of the Fleet; but under&s;tanding that there were but five men of War de&s;igned for their Convoy, and perceiving by &s;o &s;lender a provi&s;ion of &s;hips of war, that he intended to draw an affront, together with the whole blame of the <HI>Rochellers</HI> upon him, he refu&s;es to accept it, but declared withall, that, if he would go in per&s;on, he would be ready to accompany him; Upon this his refu&s;al, the Duke of <HI>Buckingham</HI> re-inforces the Fleet with five great &s;hips more, and many other men of War; and being rai&s;ed to the number of &s;eventy in all, on the 17th. day of <HI>May,</HI> he &s;ent them orders to hoi&s;e Sail, which they did under the command of his brother-in-Law, the Earle of <HI>Denbigh;</HI> &s;oon as the enemy de&s;cryed them, they weigh Anchor, as if they in|tended to advance, and fight them; but on the &s;udden tacked a|bout again towards the &s;ame place from whence they came. <HI>Brag|neau</HI> took a French Pinnace at <HI>Sablenceau,</HI> where the Earle ca&s;t Anchor &s;o near the Shore, that he thence received a Canon-&s;hot into his own &s;hip, which made him weigh Anchor again, and with the whole Navy remove to ride at a greater di&s;tance from the enemies Canon. Many dayes were &s;pent in debates, and re|&s;olutions never executed; &s;o that &s;ome Merchants, that were there, urged him to attempt either to fight, or pa&s;s by them; but his Captains &s;tiffely maintained that it could not be done, with|out expo&s;ing the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Forces to too great a hazard; only the <HI>Vice-admiral,</HI> and one Capta in <HI>Carre,</HI> &s;hewed more forward|ne&s;s, and loudly exclaimed again&s;t the flackne&s;s of all the re&s;t: Whereupon the <HI>French</HI> that were then in the Fleet, to the num|ber of two or three and twenty &s;hips, and <HI>Barques</HI> drew up together, and &s;eeing the backwardne&s;s of the others to re&s;olve on any thing, come in a Body to the Earle of <HI>Denbigh,</HI> and pre|&s;ent him a Petition &s;igned by them all, by which they be&s;eeched him to grant them four Merchant-men fitted for a fight, three fire|&s;hips, and Souldiers to guard tho&s;e &s;hips that carried the provi&s;i|ons, obliging them&s;elves with that equipage to get into the town,

<P>But let us now &s;ee what pa&s;&s;ed at the Siege of <HI>Saint Afrique,</HI> a &s;mall Town, lying between two hills that command it, &s;o that nothing can be done within, that may not from thence be di&s;co|vered; neither did any till this time, ever think of fortifying it: But yet the importance of the place for pre&s;erving the Commu|nication between the higher, and the lower <HI>Languedoc</HI> obliged us to break the ground, which is there very maniable: But never did that Town expect the honour of an a&s;&s;ault from the fir&s;t Prince of the blood: The River <HI>Sorgue</HI> runs under the walls of it, and divides it from that part of the Suburbs, that lies towards <HI>Vabre,</HI> which of nece&s;&s;ity was to be fortified al&s;o, it being ea&s;ie for the enemy to make his approaches that way, and for that the River beating again&s;t the Walls, would not give way to any nearer for|tifications on that &s;ide: The whole fortification of this Suburbs was compo&s;ed of Spurs, and little Flanquers, who&s;e Trenches were four fathom wide, and the Parapet Canon-proof, behind it was nothing but a &s;mall bank in&s;tead of a Rampart; all that gave us hopes to be able to defend it, was, that there was room enough for us to intrench our &s;elves behind it; be&s;ides, &s;o &s;trangely odde was the &s;ituation of that place, that without a great Army, there was no hindering of relief from coming to it, both from <HI>Millaud, Saint Rome, Tarn,</HI> and the Bridge of <HI>Cauvers.</HI></P>

<P>In this march, which la&s;ted &s;ix or &s;even dayes, he burnt much Corn, and al&s;o many Villages; which done, he retires to <HI>Beaucaire</HI> (having not at all entred into the Territories of <HI>Ni&s;mes</HI>) and the Troops of <HI>Dauphine</HI> returned to joyn with the Marque&s;s of <HI>Uxelles,</HI> all the Voluntiers went home; the forces of the lower <HI>Languedoc</HI> were &s;ent into Gari&s;ons, and the Duke of <HI>Mont|morency</HI> him&s;elf went to <HI>Bezieres</HI> and <HI>Pezenas.</HI></P>
<P>About this time came a Gentleman from the King of <HI>England</HI> to the Duke, which di&s;patch was occa&s;ioned by an apprehen&s;ion given him, that &s;ince the return of the &s;econd Fleet, there were two Deputies with the Duke of <HI>Rohan,</HI> in order to a Treaty for peace; to divert which, he was commanded to tell him, that though that Fleet after an ineffectual Voyage were returned, yet there was now &s;o &s;trong a one prepared, and ready to &s;et Saile, that he was confident it would be the entire deliverance of <HI>Ro|chelle;</HI> and that though God &s;hould not favour him in that at|tempt, yet would he never for&s;ake the re&s;t of the Reformed Party; Nay, although there &s;hould be no more left than the very per&s;on of the Duke, he a&s;&s;ured him he would hazard all that he was Ma&s;ter of, for the pre&s;ervation of that alone; de&s;i|ring further to know of him what hopes he had of a&s;&s;i&s;tance from <HI>Italy</HI> and <HI>Spaine,</HI> that in ca&s;e the King &s;hould pre&s;s him too hard, he might be directed by him how to a&s;&s;i&s;t him, either by a diver&s;ion or otherwi&s;e: <HI>David,</HI> one of the Deputies of <HI>Ro|chelle</HI> was pre&s;ent at the delivery of this Me&s;&s;age: To which the Duke replied, that he was &s;o far from any thoughts of a Treaty, that he had again cau&s;ed the Oath of Union to be renewed, to this effect, that none &s;hould hearken to any peace, but conjoyntly with him; and that he had already made known to him, the means he had to a&s;&s;i&s;t him.</P>
<P>This done, the Duke &s;eeing the Duke of <HI>Monmorency</HI>'s Troops lay &s;cattered and di&s;per&s;ed in &s;everal parts, takes his turn al&s;o, and burnt all the Corn, and Countrey Hou&s;es belonging to the Inhabitants of <HI>Beaucaire,</HI> within Mu&s;quet &s;hot of their very walls: And when he thought to make another inrode into the <HI>Mari&s;h-Countrey</HI> for Salt, he met, in a narrow place upon the <HI>Rhone,</HI> nearer home, two Barques convoyed by a Frigote, and laden with four and twenty thou&s;and <HI>French</HI> Bu&s;hels, &s;o that commanding &s;ome of his Souldiers to &s;wim to the other &s;ide for a Boat, he tran&s;ported many of his Foot to <HI>Camargues,</HI> that he might on both &s;ides attaque the Frigote; but &s;he &s;oon for|&s;ook her Merchandize, which was as quickly carried away: Be|&s;ides

this booty, they drove much Cattle from <HI>Camargues,</HI> and did much &s;poyle there al&s;o by fire. When the Duke of <HI>Montmo|rency</HI> heard of the&s;e excur&s;ions, he made ha&s;te to rally his for|ces, appointing them their Rendez-vous at <HI>Lunel.</HI> The Duke, in this expedition, going, and returning, marched above four|teen long Leagues, without making any long &s;tay in any place; and got home again before any of the enemy could be gotten together; And happy was it for him; for he was but in an ill condition to fight; every Souldier being &s;o laden with pillage, that he could never get any more to march in order, than three hundred &s;ouldiers, of <HI>la Baume</HI>'s Regiment, which brought up the Rear.</P>
<P>When this expedition was over, the Duke was in great per|plexities, not knowing how to di&s;po&s;e of his Forces, e&s;pecially his Hor&s;e: For he could now rai&s;e no more contribution for their maintenance, by rea&s;on that the Villages were all burnt: And the <HI>Sevenes</HI> was no Countrey for Hor&s;e: If he &s;hould go towards <HI>Castres,</HI> there was the Prince with his Army in the higher <HI>Languedoc,</HI> who had particular Orders to impede his pa&s;&s;age; and the Duke of <HI>Montmorency</HI> had al&s;o a &s;trict Com|mand, with his Forces to follow him, whither ever he &s;hould go: For it was feared le&s;t he &s;hould go to <HI>Montauban,</HI> and rai&s;e tho&s;e of the Religion in <HI>Guienne</HI> in favour of the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> who&s;e coming they feared: If he went into <HI>Rouergue</HI> to no o|ther end but to eat them up, it would not be long ere their cryes would be heard; &s;o that nece&s;&s;ity now obliged him to undertake the &s;iege of <HI>Cre&s;eil.</HI></P>

<P>And here it will be expedient to in&s;ert a word or two concer|ning <HI>Clau&s;el,</HI> who coming from <HI>Piedmont,</HI> made the Duke of <HI>Rohan</HI> &s;ome propo&s;itions of a&s;&s;i&s;tance from <HI>Spaine;</HI> which, if de|manded, he was confident he might have freely, and in a large mea&s;ure; for that having conferred about it with the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Em|ba&s;&s;adour in <HI>Piedmont,</HI> he had given him very good hopes of it; telling him moreover, that it was the Intere&s;t of <HI>Spaine,</HI> to endeavour a prolongation of the Civil Wars in <HI>France;</HI> that they might with more ea&s;e compa&s;s their de&s;igns in <HI>Italy;</HI> that the Abbot <HI>Scaglia,</HI> the Dake of <HI>Savoy</HI>'s Emba&s;&s;adour, was now in <HI>Spaine,</HI> and would contribute his utmo&s;t power to a&s;&s;i&s;t him in it; having already in <HI>England,</HI> and el&s;ewhere, declared him&s;elf a great favourer of the Reformed Party, out of his implacable hatred to tho&s;e that govern now in <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P>The great exigencies the Duke was in for want of money, the Countrey being unable, aad the Towns unwilling to furni&s;h him any more; neither could he expect any from <HI>England;</HI> nor had he received any thing from the Duke of <HI>Savoy,</HI> but empty promi&s;es, enforced him to &s;eek out &s;ome way or other to &s;up|ply his wants; and in effect he &s;aw none but this; which yet he dur&s;t not pitch upon, without the King of <HI>England</HI>'s leave, fear|ing le&s;t it might give him an offence, and con&s;equently an oc|ca&s;ion to de&s;ert him: Notwith&s;tanding this doubt, yet would he not reject <HI>Clau&s;el</HI>'s propo&s;als; but deferres his di&s;patch, till he could give notice of it to the King of <HI>England,</HI> and to his Emba&s;&s;adour then in <HI>Piedmont;</HI> from both whom he received very favourable an&s;wers; and then &s;ent <HI>Clau&s;el</HI> into <HI>Spaine;</HI> In|joyning him to declare to the King of <HI>Spaine,</HI> that if the con|tinuance of the War in <HI>France</HI> might be &s;erviceable to his de|&s;ignes, upon condition he would afford tho&s;e of the Religion a &s;peedy and round &s;upply of money, he would engage him&s;elf to protect it, as long as it &s;hould be agreed upon between them; but that otherwi&s;e he &s;hould be con&s;trained to make his peace; that he &s;hould have the whole Winter to provide it, and that he would expect his an&s;wer till the next March: And fora&s;much as that, immediately after the departure of <HI>Clau&s;el,</HI> there came news of the lo&s;s of <HI>Rochelle;</HI> he &s;ent two Me&s;&s;engers after him to let him know, that that accident had not any thing &s;haken his re&s;olutions; but that he continued con&s;tant to his former pro|po&s;als. <HI>Clau&s;el</HI> pa&s;&s;es through <HI>Foix</HI> into <HI>Spaine,</HI> where he was very well received, and heard; and had very advantageous Pro|po&s;itions

made him al&s;o; All which good news he imparts to the Duke of <HI>Rohan;</HI> giving him good hopes of a prompt, and powerful a&s;&s;i&s;tance: At length having concluded the Treaty, he goes into <HI>Piedmont,</HI> to facilitate and expedite the execution of all things; and as he went, landed a Gentleman belonging to the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> who was to have brought the Duke a Copy of the Agreement; But he &s;uffered him&s;elf to be taken at the Gates of <HI>Lunel,</HI> when he had but half a League more to go be|yond all danger, of which <HI>Rohan</HI> adverti&s;ed <HI>Clau&s;el,</HI> who when he came to <HI>Piedmont,</HI> gave the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Emba&s;&s;adour an account of all his negotiation.</P>
<P>Return we now to <HI>Cre&s;eil,</HI> a place about a Canon &s;hot di|&s;tant from <HI>Millaud,</HI> having a treble inclo&s;ure of Walls, one whereof environs the Town, and the two others the Ca&s;tle, which mu&s;t be forced one after another, for that there is no co|ming at the Ca&s;tle, but through the Town; the farthe&s;t part of it being built upon a Rock of a va&s;t height: It is true, the Walls that inclo&s;e the Town are not worth any thing, being ru|inous, and full of breaches, &s;o that it were a &s;hame to lie eight dayes before it, and not to take it: But he that has to deale with a people, to whom no de&s;ign &s;eems difficult, and when they come to put it in execution, make no provi&s;ion of nece&s;&s;a|ries to effect it, will want no incumbrances: <HI>Rohan</HI> gives no|tice of his intentions to <HI>Alteyrac</HI> and <HI>Guerin,</HI> that without any noi&s;e, they might put all things in a readine&s;s to effect them; and gave <HI>Alteyrac</HI> al&s;o Orders to block up the place, a day before he came with his Troops; that &s;o he might &s;urprize it at a greater advantage, when meanly furni&s;hed with Souldiers; which he did, but yet all their diligence could not prevent the entry of &s;upplies into it.</P>
<P>When the Troops were all come up, the Siege was formed, and a battery of two Guns rai&s;ed, which had not di&s;charged &s;ix &s;hot, before the Carriage of one of them flew all to pieces; and when that was mended, the like accident befell the other; &s;o that the whole time, almo&s;t, was &s;pent in repairing the Carri|ages of the Guns; and with &s;uch untoward Timber, that when all was done, they did but little better than before; &s;o that the breach being not made large enough in one day, they were fain to remit the pro&s;ecution of their battery till the morrow, which gave the be&s;ieged lea&s;ure to repaire, and make it better than before: Neverthele&s;s urged by the &s;hortne&s;s of his time, the Duke commanded an a&s;&s;ault to be made, in which he was re|pul&s;ed. In the mean while the Duke of <HI>Montmorency,</HI> who with his Army, had &s;till waited on the motions of <HI>Rohan,</HI> joynes

<P>This Siege did at lea&s;t this good, that it pre&s;erved <HI>Cau&s;ade,</HI> which was not yet in a condition to with&s;tand &s;o great a pow|er: The night following <HI>Rohan</HI> &s;ends his Foot into <HI>Saint Rome</HI> upon <HI>Tarn,</HI> and into <HI>Saint Afrique;</HI> and &s;eeing that both Ar|mies were &s;o near him, he thought with his Cavalry, having no baggage to incumber them, he might reach <HI>Castres</HI> in one night: This he propo&s;ed to his Officers, who were of opinion, that it would be convenient to &s;tay one day longer, to ob&s;erve the countenance of the enemy, which totally fru&s;trated his intenti|ons of pa&s;&s;ing that way; for as he was about to attempt it the next day, he found that <HI>Montmorency</HI> had prevented him, and waited for him on the way both with Hor&s;e and Foot; which made him in&s;tantly re&s;olve to take with him all his Forces, and by great Marches got into the higher <HI>Languedoc,</HI> to be&s;iege <HI>Aimargues,</HI> which he was confident (in ca&s;e he found but the ordinary Garri&s;on in it) a few dayes would make him Ma&s;ter of; It is a Town of an indifferent bigne&s;s, di&s;tant about four leagues from <HI>Ni&s;mes,</HI> and one from <HI>Lunel,</HI> &s;eated in the be&s;t part of that Countrey, and upon a Flat, no wayes to be commanded, the mold al&s;o being &s;oft, and tractable; and in &s;hort, accommoda|ted with all things nece&s;&s;ary to make it a very brave place; it is al&s;o inclo&s;ed with fair Free-&s;tone Walls, flanked with &s;mall Towers, and a large and deep Trench, full of water, on the out&s;ide of which were two or three half Moons, little, and ill made. To this end he &s;ent <HI>Aubais</HI> to <HI>Ni&s;mes,</HI> to get the Ca|non in a readine&s;s, and that he might the better conceal his de|&s;ign, divides his Forces, and marches thither two &s;everal ways; he him&s;elf, with that party which he conducted, came thither fir&s;t, and pre&s;ently inve&s;ts the place; the next day arrived the others al&s;o, and then he a&s;&s;igned every one their po&s;t, and en|tirely blocked it up: And without further delay &s;ent to <HI>Ni&s;mes,</HI> to ha&s;ten away the Canon, which came al&s;o in good time: The night following, he plants them upon the Battery he had rai&s;ed,

and the next day, without the lo&s;s of one man, made a fair breach; and having made provi&s;ion of ladders, for that the Walls, being but low in many places, are ea&s;ily &s;calable, and the Trench in many parts pa&s;&s;eable, he di&s;po&s;ed his men for a general a&s;&s;ault: When the Governour, the Marque&s;s of <HI>Saint Sulpice,</HI> a younger brother of the hou&s;e of <HI>V&s;ez</HI> &s;aw the&s;e pre|parations, conceiving he had not men enough to defend him|&s;elf again&s;t the &s;torm, he demands a parley; the Duke of <HI>Rohan</HI> &s;ent him word, that he was much troubled that a young Gentle|man of his quality &s;hould be &s;o unfortunately engaged in a place where from his fir&s;t E&s;&s;ay he could derive nothing but di&s;advantage and di&s;honour: Neverthele&s;s out of regard to the amity between their hou&s;es, he offered him as honourable conditions, as he him|&s;elf could have de&s;ired, which he accepted, and within an houre after marched out with his Garri&s;on.</P>

<P>In the mean time <HI>Montauban</HI> goes on luckily with the War, in which that Town, without the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of any other, alwayes behaved it &s;elf be&s;t of any of the Reformed Party. <HI>Saint Mi|chel,</HI> before he engaged in any other enterpri&s;e, looks after the pre&s;ervation of <HI>Cau&s;ade,</HI> upon &s;ome jealou&s;ies he had of the Governour <HI>Cha&s;tillon;</HI> for that in all Military actions he di&s;co|vered too much offeminacy, and too much di&s;regard of things re|lating to the &s;ecurity of the Town; but principally for that he held too frequent corre&s;pondencies with tho&s;e of the adver&s;e par|ty, under pretence of procuring the enlargement of his brother, who had been a pri&s;oner ever &s;ince the la&s;t peace: Neither was he without &s;ome &s;u&s;pitions of the others aime to out him of his Government, which made him begin to think upon &s;ome way to pre&s;erve him&s;elf in it, to which end he Courts the affections of the Souldiers, and people of the Town; but before he had well made his Game, he mo&s;t imprudently declared publickly, that he would no longer own any &s;ubordination to <HI>Saint Michel,</HI> who to prevent, and cru&s;h this mi&s;chief in its birth, exhibited the Articles he had to charge <HI>Chastillon</HI> withall to the Council; whereupon it was ordered that he &s;hould be &s;ecured, and tried by a Council of War; which was neatly carried by <HI>Saint Michel,</HI> who very privately, and in&s;en&s;ibly having gotten many Souldiers into <HI>Cau&s;ade,</HI> and coming thither him&s;elf unthought on, with|out any the lea&s;t commotion, &s;eizes upon <HI>Chastillon,</HI> and car|ries him to <HI>Montauban,</HI> where he was for a time kept pri&s;oner, and examined: But whether it was, that the proofs again&s;t him were not clear enough, or that they feared le&s;t the puni&s;hing of him would be a di&s;couragement to other &s;trangers; he was &s;et at

<P><HI>Saint Michel</HI> having thus &s;ecured this Town, thinks upon taking in of many &s;mall Forts, and Ca&s;tles, which were a great di&s;turbance to <HI>Montauban;</HI> having now a fit opportunity offer'd him by the plague, that had driven away mo&s;t of the Garri&s;ons the Duke <HI>d' E&s;pernon</HI> had left about him; in pur&s;uance of which he drawes his Canon into the Field, and begins with the Ca&s;tle <HI>de la Motte d' Ardne,</HI> and having battered, and taken it by a&s;|&s;ault, fired it on the &s;econd of <HI>September:</HI> When he came back to <HI>Montauban,</HI> he had intelligence of a great body drawing up, compo&s;ed of the Countrey Forces, and &s;ome other Regiments al&s;o, &s;ent for purpo&s;ely to oppo&s;e his de&s;igns: On the 6th. of the &s;ame Moneth he lays an Ambu&s;cade for them among the Vineyards of <HI>Dieu-Pantole,</HI> about two leagues di&s;tant from <HI>Mon|tauban,</HI> and with his Hor&s;e goes to draw them into it, and meets them in the plain of <HI>Ca&s;talans,</HI> and <HI>Saint Porquier,</HI> where the enemy, without expecting till the re&s;t of their men were come up, or indeed &s;taying one for the other, pur&s;ue him in di&s;order up to the very Ambu&s;cade, where being once engaged, he char|ges them on every &s;ide, and leaves &s;ome four or five hundred of them dead upon the place, be&s;ides a great number of wounded, lo&s;ing not above three or four of his own: Thence he marches up to the very Towns of <HI>Ca&s;talans,</HI> and <HI>Saint Porquier,</HI> and o|ther Villages, and Farms, which he fired, and then returns to <HI>Montauban.</HI> The next day he be&s;ieges the Ca&s;tle of <HI>Ville-Dieu;</HI> which having endured the battery a whole day, yielded the next; tho&s;e within it had their lives given them, but they remained pri|&s;oners of War, and the place was burnt.

<P>The Garri&s;on of <HI>Salvagnac</HI> being thus re-inforced with tho&s;e of <HI>E&s;caliez,</HI> and <HI>Blavet,</HI> began now to grow in&s;olent, and would no longer &s;tand to the Agreement made with tho&s;e of <HI>Montauban,</HI> to &s;uffer them freely to pa&s;s, and repa&s;s; whereupon

<P>About the beginning of <HI>November</HI> &s;allied out &s;ixty &s;even Souldiers from the Garri&s;on of <HI>Loubejac,</HI> to lay an Ambu&s;h near <HI>Montauban,</HI> upon the great Road to <HI>Negrepeli&s;&s;e;</HI> which <HI>Saint Michel</HI> having notice of, drew out &s;ome Hor&s;e, and layed a Counter-Ambu&s;cade in the way by which they were to retreat; and charging them in an open field, &s;lew about three&s;core and four of them; and after this, took the Ca&s;tle of <HI>Bourquet</HI> by Petard. Many other little actions pa&s;&s;ed there at <HI>Montauban,</HI> in which <HI>Saint Michel</HI> alwayes came off with honour.</P>
<P>It is now time to return to the lower <HI>Languedoc,</HI> whither pre&s;ently after the taking of <HI>Monts,</HI> came the newes of the Reddition of <HI>Rochelle,</HI> after the long &s;ufferings of that poor people, had given &s;uch large te&s;timonies of their invincible con&s;tancy.</P>

<P>The Duke of <HI>Buckingham</HI> &s;taying behind, &s;ets his wits on work to find out &s;ome means to ob&s;truct the &s;ending away of the &s;upplies, and to this end, endeavours by the means of the <HI>Vene|tian</HI> Re&s;idents in <HI>England,</HI> and <HI>France,</HI> to have &s;ome over|tures for a peace made: But &s;eeing that took not, he re&s;olves up|on a journey to <HI>Port&s;mouth;</HI> but before his departure, &s;ends for <HI>Vincent,</HI> a Mini&s;ter of the Church of <HI>Rochelle,</HI> and makes him write a per&s;wa&s;ive letter to the <HI>Rochellers,</HI> to di&s;po&s;e them&s;elves to accept of the peace the Duke of <HI>Buckingham</HI> was now procu|ring for them; which the Emba&s;&s;adour of <HI>Savoy</HI> having an inkling of, he plainly demon&s;trates to <HI>Vincent,</HI> that it was only an invention to retard the departure of the Fleet, and &s;o defeated that project.</P>
<P>At length, on the 24th. of <HI>August,</HI> comes the Duke of <HI>Buckingham</HI> to <HI>Port&s;mouth,</HI> and on the 29th. arrived there fifty &s;hips, &s;ome men of War, and others laden with provi&s;ion, and ammunition: But on the &s;econd of <HI>September,</HI> the Duke of <HI>Sou|bize</HI> going to vi&s;it the Duke of <HI>Buckingham,</HI> as he had newly di|ned, he told him that ju&s;t then he had received intelligence of the re-victualling of <HI>Rochelle,</HI> and that he was now going with the newes to the King; and as he was lifting up the Hangings to go forth of the Room, he was &s;tabbed with a Knife, into the great Attery of the heart, by an Officer, who&s;e name was <HI>Fellon,</HI> of which he fell, and dyed immediatly: Nor were the Duke of <HI>Sou|bize,</HI> and his followers free from danger, it being muttered in the Chamber, that it was a French-man had done this act; but <HI>Felton,</HI> who might have ea&s;ily e&s;caped, if he had li&s;ted, having not been ob&s;erved by any one, voluntarily di&s;covers him&s;elf to be the Authour of this Homicide; &s;aying, that it was better that two men &s;hould peri&s;h, than a whole Kingdom. The next day the King makes the Earle of <HI>Lind&s;ey</HI> Admiral, <HI>Morton</HI> Vice-ad|miral, and <HI>Montjoy</HI> Reare-admiral; the other commands were not changed, but the &s;ame Captains that were in the former ex|pedition, went al&s;o in this, with a greater force, but the &s;ame re&s;olutions.

<P>On the nine and twentieth of <HI>September</HI> came the Fleet in|to the Rode of <HI>Rochelle,</HI> and after a calm, which continued all <HI>Sunday</HI> and <HI>Munday</HI> following, at night the Wind aro&s;e, and &s;ate faire for a &s;ight, &s;o that about two houres before day, up|on the Admiral's firing of a Gun, they all &s;et &s;ayle, and at &s;ix of the clock in the morning began a fight, which la&s;ted about three houres, in which, on both &s;ides, were di&s;charged three or four thou&s;and piece of Canon, and that was all: The next day about the &s;ame houre was the fight renewed, but more tempe|rately, and at a greater di&s;tance, &s;o that both tho&s;e fights were concluded without any great lo&s;s to either &s;ide: On the third of <HI>October</HI> comes up to them <HI>Friquelet</HI> a Captain that had formerly &s;erved under the Duke of <HI>Soubize,</HI> and coming, as he &s;aid, from <HI>Tremblade,</HI> &s;hews a Letter from the Captain <HI>Tre&s;lebois,</HI> de&s;iring him to know of them whether they would hearken to a Treaty of peace or no; to which was an&s;wered, that he &s;hould &s;hew his pa&s;s-port, or el&s;e that <HI>Tre&s;lebois</HI> &s;hould come up in his Shalloup between the two Fleets, and there let them know what he had to &s;ay; which, on the &s;eventh of the &s;ame moneth, he did, with one who&s;e name was <HI>de l' I&s;le,</HI> both who were remitted to <HI>Montague</HI> and <HI>Forain,</HI> who, finding that they had no particu|lar Commi&s;&s;ion, but came only to know whether the <HI>French</HI> would Treat apart, excluding the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> an&s;wered them, that that could not be, and &s;o both retired to their own Parties: Ne|verthele&s;s upon occa&s;ion of this interview the Admiral &s;ent <HI>Montague</HI> with a Dutch Gentleman who&s;e name was <HI>Kimphau&s;|&s;en,</HI> under colour of demanding of &s;ome Mariners, that were Pri&s;oners in the <HI>French</HI> Fleet; but his going thither again the two dayes following, pretending they had promi&s;ed to &s;hew him the Barricado in the Port, and confe&s;&s;ing, at his return, that he had not &s;een it, becau&s;e the Tide did not &s;erve, bred &s;ome jea|lou&s;ies, that he went thither upon &s;ome other de&s;ign; And when, upon a report that there had Articles mutually pa&s;&s;ed between them, the Duke of <HI>Soubize</HI> complained that they had entred up|on a Treaty, unknown to him, and without the Privity of tho&s;e that were principally concerned in it; it was flatly denied: But when the continual goings to and fro of <HI>Montague,</HI> had confir|med

<P>On <HI>Sunday</HI> the one and twentieth of this moneth there hapned a remarkable pa&s;&s;age; one <HI>Pojanne,</HI> a Captain that had former|ly &s;erved under the Duke of <HI>Soubize,</HI> a Villain covered with Crimes, and that had now redeemed his life, by the engage|ments he had pa&s;&s;ed to the Cardinal, to kill, or burn <HI>Soubize</HI> in his &s;hip, &s;ets &s;aile out of the River of <HI>Bourdeaux,</HI> in a good &s;hip of two hundred Tun burthen, and filled with Combu&s;tible matter; and, the better to palliate his de&s;ign, pa&s;&s;es as an ene|my, making prize of &s;everal <HI>French</HI> he met withal, and &s;o gets up to the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Fleet; When he was come in among them, he tells them that he was come to &s;erve the Party of the Religi|on as he had formerly done, and de&s;ires to be conducted to the Duke of <HI>Soubize</HI> who knevv him very vvell: With him vvas a Gentleman of <HI>Anjou,</HI> vvho, as he vvas going to <HI>Rochelle,</HI> had been ca&s;t upon the Coa&s;t of <HI>Spaine,</HI> there taken, and thence &s;ent to the Cardinal, vvho finding him to be a bold and adven|turous per&s;on, promi&s;ed him not only his pardon, but infinite re|compences in ca&s;e he would accompany <HI>Pojanne</HI> in this enter|prize: The de&s;ire he had to &s;ave him&s;elf together with the per|&s;wa&s;ions of his brother, who was a &s;ervant to the Cardinal, made him promi&s;e whatever they required of him: But when they came to the fleet, he unfolded the whole plot to <HI>Soubize,</HI> whereupon <HI>Pojanne</HI> was taken Pri&s;oner, his &s;hip and Prizes &s;ei|zed on: And to prove that this Gentleman &s;aid nothing but truth, he offered to get through into <HI>Rochelle</HI> with the Cardinal's pa&s;s, and to return thence with a true account of the condition of the place: His offer was accepted of, and double Letters were given him, &s;ome of which he &s;hewed to the Cardinal, im|porting a reque&s;t to permit him to make this Voyage, and a pro|mi&s;e at his return to give him a perfect relation of his di&s;covery. Thus he got in, and returned with other private Letters, which truly repre&s;ented the &s;tate of <HI>Rochelle,</HI> which was &s;o &s;ad, that in ca&s;e they were not relieved within two dayes, there would be none left alive in it, and that they were now upon the point of yielding.</P>

Chri&s;tian re&s;olution, and nothing varying from the whole cour&s;e of her life, which though it had been a continued tex|ture of afflictions; yet, by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of God, with &s;uch for|titude comported &s;he her &s;elf in them all, that &s;he has ju&s;tly merited the applau&s;e and benediction of all good people; and will yield po&s;terity a mo&s;t illu&s;trious example of an unparallela|ble vertue, and admirable piety. Thus this poor Town, once the Cabinet and delight of <HI>Henry</HI> the Fourth, is now become the Subject of the wrath and Triumph of his Son <HI>Lewis</HI> the Thirteenth: It was a&s;&s;aulted by the <HI>French,</HI> abandoned by the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> and buried in a grievous and mercile&s;s Famine; but in the conclu&s;ion, has, by its con&s;tancy, gained a more glorious Re|nown in &s;ucceeding ages, than tho&s;e, who&s;e uninterrupted pro&s;pe|rity makes them the envy of the pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>This newes cau&s;ed a wonderful and general dejection a|mong the whole Party, every one ca&s;ting about, how to make his own peace; and many made publick addre&s;&s;es to that end, alledging, that &s;ince <HI>Rochelle</HI> was now lo&s;t, for who&s;e pre&s;erva|tion only they had taken up Armes, it was nece&s;&s;ary that they al&s;o &s;hould make their own compo&s;itions, before a greater ex|tremity befell them; On the other &s;ide the <HI>Romani&s;ts,</HI> by means of the Confederates they had in the Townes of the Religion, infu&s;ed &s;ugge&s;tions into them, per&s;wading them to a &s;peedy compliance, and that their early &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, would procure them a better reception; offering withal, large recompences to tho&s;e that could induce their Corporations to &s;end their Depu|ties to the King, who at the &s;ame time al&s;o, publi&s;hed a Decla|ration, wherein he promi&s;ed to receive again into his favour and protection, any particular per&s;ons, or Towns that &s;hould petition him to that effect.</P>
<P>The people wearied and ruined with the Warre, and who&s;e &s;pirits naturally &s;toop to adver&s;ity; the Merchants di&s;contented at their lo&s;s of Trading; the Citizens grieved to &s;ee their hou|&s;es burnt, and their lands lie idle immanured, and untilled, all encline to a peace upon any terms what&s;oever: But of all others the di&s;temper of <HI>Ca&s;tres</HI> was the greate&s;t, by rea&s;on of the divi|&s;ions between <HI>Chavagnac</HI> and <HI>Saint Germier,</HI> who &s;upported by the Con&s;uls, and others, who &s;tayed in the Town purpo&s;ely to mi&s;chieve the whole party, who played their game &s;o well with the Council of <HI>Albigeois,</HI> that they procured Deputies to be &s;ent to the Duke of <HI>Rohan,</HI> to de&s;ire his pre&s;ence, without which their ills were irremedible, and to &s;ummon him, upon his pro|mi&s;es, to convene a General A&s;&s;embly, which might, together with him, take care of the publique affairs; giving the Deputies

charge to return with his an&s;wer as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible, that accor|dingly they might re&s;olve on what they had to do.</P>
<P>This re&s;olution, as al&s;o the election of the Deputies, was made contrary to the advice of <HI>Chavagnac,</HI> one of them being a Kin&s;man of <HI>Saint Germiers,</HI> yet was he fain to &s;ubmit to it for the pre&s;ent. The project of this me&s;&s;age was grounded upon the impo&s;&s;ibility they conceived of the Duke's being able to come to them; and upon a belief, that were the way open, yet would he never curb his own power by a General A&s;&s;embly; &s;o that upon his refu&s;al they promi&s;ed them&s;elves a fair and plau&s;ible pre|tence, to make their own particular peace, or at lea&s;t, that making the A&s;&s;embly their own, they &s;hould compel him to a&s;|&s;ent to what they li&s;ted: Which the Duke of <HI>Rohan</HI> fore&s;eeing, and having al&s;o, before the arrival of the Deputies, reflected on a General A&s;&s;embly, as the only expedient, to pre&s;erve an en|tire unity among them, he conde&s;cended to all their de&s;ires; and that he might lo&s;e no time, took the Deputies with him to <HI>Ni&s;mes,</HI> where they made choice of Deputies for the lower <HI>Lan|guedoc;</HI> thence went they to the <HI>Sevenes,</HI> where they did the like, leaving the time and place for the Convention to his de|termination: He &s;ent them al&s;o Orders into <HI>Vivaretz</HI> to elect their Deputies too; and then, having taken Order for the gal|lant fortifications he had begun at <HI>Aimargues,</HI> and all Gari|&s;ons nece&s;&s;ary to be kept in the two Provinces, during his ab|&s;ence, he takes all his Hor&s;e, and five hundred Foot, and with them comes to <HI>Castres</HI> about the beginning of <HI>December,</HI> where he found <HI>Rou&s;&s;eliere,</HI> whom the Inhabitants of <HI>Saverdun</HI> had driven out of their Town, by means of <HI>La Plante,</HI> his Lieu|tenant there, who &s;uffering him&s;elf to be &s;educed by their tem|ptations, had drawn the Gari&s;on out of the higher Town, and given it up into their hands: This was al&s;o much promoted by the mi&s;-intelligence happened between <HI>Mazaribal</HI> (whom the Duke of <HI>Rohan,</HI> upon the death of <HI>Saint Estienne,</HI> had made Governour of <HI>Foix</HI>) and <HI>la Rou&s;&s;eliere;</HI> upon this occa&s;ion; for that <HI>Mazaribal</HI> his facility made him too much yield to the follicitations of &s;ome of the Inhabitants of <HI>Mazeres</HI> (who&s;e vil|lainy was not then known to him, as he confe&s;&s;ed afterwards, and that he took them for per&s;ons well-affected to the Party) to uphold the Enemies of <HI>la Rou&s;&s;eliere</HI> both in <HI>Saverdun,</HI> and <HI>Carlat;</HI> which made him requite his courte&s;ie, by &s;hewing fa|vour al&s;o to all again&s;t whom <HI>Mazaribal</HI> had any Picque; and to &s;uch a height grew their animo&s;ities one again&s;t another, that <HI>Mazaribal</HI> ob&s;tructed, as much as he could, the payment of the Gari&s;on of <HI>Saverdun,</HI> and gave free pa&s;&s;age to the Souldi|ers
<PB N="193" REF="102">
that ran from <HI>la Rou&s;&s;eliere;</HI> which much elevated the &s;pi|rits of his enemies, who cheri&s;hed <HI>Mazaribal</HI> with hopes, that in ca&s;e they could rid them&s;elves of the other, they would re|ceive him into his place; but when, upon the expul&s;ion of the other, he had a minde to go thither to reap the fruits of their promi&s;es, they reduced his train to a le&s;s number at the fir&s;t, and &s;hut their Gates upon him the &s;econd time; but prote&s;ted notwith&s;tanding to continue firm to the Party; which neverthe|le&s;s, when they had &s;ufficiently &s;ecured the place, they utterly abandoned it, and pre&s;ently made addre&s;&s;es by their Deputies, to the King. It was then (but too late) that <HI>Mazaribal</HI> clearly perceived the wicked intentions of <HI>la Rou&s;&s;eliere</HI>'s enemies, who&s;e Treachery he could not now &s;ufficiently aggra|vate.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t thing the Duke of <HI>Rohan</HI> did, when he came to <HI>Ca|stres,</HI> was to a&s;&s;emble the two <HI>Colloques</HI> of <HI>Albigeois</HI> and <HI>Lau|raguais,</HI> to acquaint them with the re&s;olutions of the lower <HI>Languedoc,</HI> and the <HI>Sevenes,</HI> and to incite them, by the others example, to choo&s;e Deputies al&s;o for the General A&s;&s;embly; the like was al&s;o done by <HI>Montauban, Foix,</HI> and <HI>Ro&uuml;ergne:</HI> After this he endeavoured to compo&s;e the difference between <HI>Chavagnac</HI> and <HI>Saint Germier,</HI> which was now grown into &s;o formal a quarrel, that mutual challenges had pa&s;&s;ed between them: But though <HI>Saint Germier</HI> refu&s;ed not to &s;ubmit to a reconciliation, yet would he not condi&s;cend to own <HI>Chavagnac,</HI> as his Superiour in the Town of <HI>Ca&s;tres:</HI> But on the contrary he profe&s;&s;ed publiquely, and in private, and even in the Council-Hou&s;e, that he would oppo&s;e him in all things, and in all pla|ces. This made the Duke of <HI>Rohan</HI> think of removing him in|to the lower <HI>Languedoc;</HI> to which end he offered him a Troop of Hor&s;e, and an honourable allowance for him&s;elf and his re|tinue; but his Parti&s;ans, &s;eeing that this tended to the di&s;&s;ipati|on of their faction, di&s;&s;waded him from it, promi&s;ing him with|all, that if he could find out any way to evade that employment, they would make him Ma&s;ter of their Town.</P>
<P>The Duke al&s;o, finding the great &s;carcity of Corn was in <HI>Ca&s;tres,</HI> to &s;upply that want, gets them to re&s;olve to borrow ten thou&s;and Crowns to buy &s;ome; and offered them, during his abode there, &s;ufficient Convoyes to conduct it &s;afe thither: But &s;eeing that could not be effected, he &s;eeks out &s;ome other way to &s;upply the nece&s;&s;ities of the Town: And under&s;tanding that there was a great quantity at <HI>Saint Amant,</HI> which lies in the Valley of <HI>Mazamet;</HI> he claps a Petarde to the Town, and
<PB N="194" REF="103">
by that means enters it, and be&s;ieges the Ca&s;tle, which being hardly pre&s;&s;ed, yielded al&s;o, and at three or four Convoyes, was the greate&s;t part of the Corn carried to <HI>Castres:</HI> This exploit was performed by <HI>Chavagnac;</HI> He &s;ent al&s;o for more provi&s;ions to &s;ome of the Religion, that living as Neuters, hoped by that means to &s;ecure them&s;elves again&s;t all parties.</P>
<P>He cau&s;ed <HI>Donaret</HI> the fir&s;t Con&s;ul of <HI>Realmont,</HI> who was a great in&s;trument of the taking of the Town, to be tried, and ex|ecuted; but with much difficulty, for that having married the Pre&s;ident <HI>Monte&s;pieu</HI>'s Neece (&s;uch per&s;ons &s;eldom wanting In|terce&s;&s;ours) they were loth to pronounce a &s;entence of Death again&s;t him: After this, the Winter came on &s;o furiou&s;ly, that he could not proceed in his intended De&s;igne upon <HI>Bra&s;|&s;ac.</HI></P>
<P>Whiles he &s;tayed at <HI>Castres,</HI> he al&s;o defeated two &s;everal ne|gotiations for particular Peaces: The fir&s;t was carried on by <HI>Dejan</HI> a native of <HI>Montauban,</HI> who having formerly bought the Office of Provo&s;t of the Town, which the Corporation op|po&s;ed as a thing long before aboli&s;hed, after a long &s;uit, and a great expence of money he was faine to accept of what he had disbur&s;ed: This man being at the Court, had fre&s;h hopes given him of this Office, in ca&s;e he could effect any thing in this ne|gotiation: To this Lure he &s;toops, and having his Commi&s;&s;ion di&s;patched, comes away with two Letters from <HI>Galand;</HI> one for <HI>Montauban,</HI> and another for <HI>Castres.</HI> At the fir&s;t place he was refu&s;ed, and referred to the Duke of <HI>Rohan;</HI> and as for the &s;e|cond, he dur&s;t not go directly thither, but approaches as near it, as <HI>Bouquiere,</HI> which is about a League from it, and thence Writes to <HI>Dupuy,</HI> to let him know that he was very de&s;irous to &s;peak with him about a bu&s;ine&s;s of great importance; but he &s;ent him word again, That he could not do it, unle&s;s he would fir&s;t acquaint him with the nature of it: Whereupon he e&s;&s;ayes a &s;econd time to prevail with him, but in vain; &s;o that not da|ring to come into <HI>Ca&s;tres,</HI> he was fain to return again without any further &s;atisfaction: Thus his Voyage bringing no advan|tage to the Court, was nothing beneficial to him&s;elf neither, who reaped no fruits at all of tho&s;e many fair hopes were given him.</P>
<P>The other was managed by the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Mende,</HI> who was &s;omewhat more zealous in it, as &s;hall be &s;een in another place; but for the pre&s;ent he di&s;covered him&s;elf thus far, and to the Duke of <HI>Rohan</HI> too; that being a &s;ervant to the Cardinal, he had received a Commi&s;&s;ion to Treat with particular per&s;ons, and Corporations, either &s;everally, or conjunctively, and e&s;pecially
<PB N="195" REF="103">
with him; that if he would hearken to him, he would procure him conditions, in which he &s;hould find what &s;atisfaction he could de&s;ire; but if he would hear of none but a general Trea|ty, he mu&s;t not expect &s;o good; and &s;o openly did he di&s;cover his purpo&s;es, that <HI>Saint Michel</HI> Governour of <HI>Montauban,</HI> fear|ing le&s;t he &s;hould engage in a Treaty without his Privity, &s;ent a &s;ervant of his own towards the Duke of <HI>Rohan,</HI> to ob&s;erve what was done, that the intelligence he &s;hould receive of the tran&s;|actions there, might direct him how to &s;teer his cour&s;e; vvho, vvhen he &s;avv that the Duke vvould not li&s;ten to a Man not im|powered by any Commi&s;&s;ion, nor admit of any clande&s;tine or particular Treaty, di&s;covered him&s;elf, and told him, that he was &s;ent to inform him from the Governour, that the Bi&s;hop had made &s;ome overtures to him concerning a particular Treaty for <HI>Montauban,</HI> but that he had rejected his Propo&s;itions; ne|verthele&s;s if he had any inclinations to a general Treaty, he was very well acquainted with him, and could do him much &s;ervice in it.</P>
<P>On the other &s;ide, the Bi&s;hop nothing &s;atisfied with <HI>Rohan</HI>'s an&s;wer; and rightly conjecturing, that his pre&s;ence would be injurious to his de&s;ign; re&s;olves to have patience, untill his re|turn into the lower <HI>Languedoc;</HI> that in his ab&s;ence he might the more effectually prevail upon the &s;everal Corpora|tions.</P>
<P>There remained nothing more now, than by a Provident fore-&s;ight, to prevent all inconveniencies, might intervene at <HI>Ca&s;tres,</HI> during his ab&s;ence: To this end he &s;ettles in the Con|&s;ulate per&s;ons of great integrity, and no le&s;s fidelity to him&s;elf, bani&s;hing from the Town three of the old Con&s;uls, and &s;ome others al&s;o, of whom he had great jealou&s;ie; and placed there four Companies of Foot, for who&s;e &s;ub&s;i&s;tence he al&s;o provi|ded: The bu&s;ine&s;s of <HI>Saint Germier</HI> was the only thing he could not hand&s;omely cleare, becau&s;e he had ab&s;ented him&s;elf from the Town; which obliged the Duke of <HI>Rohan</HI> to make an Order, prohibiting <HI>Chavagnac,</HI> and the Con&s;uls, to give him, or any of his brothers, any admittance into it; and, in ca&s;e he came not in to them within the &s;pace of eight dayes, to Pro|claim him a de&s;erter of his Party: He &s;ent al&s;o a Company of Foot into <HI>Roque-courbe,</HI> and another into <HI>Viane;</HI> forbidding them al&s;o to receive <HI>Saint Germier</HI> and his brothers, and leaves three hundred Men, which he brought out of the lower <HI>Langue|doc,</HI> in <HI>Saint Amant,</HI> where, for their maintenance, he allotted them their proportions out of a part of the Corn was found there.</P>
<PB N="196" REF="104">
<P>When he had done this, he went with the Deputies of the General A&s;&s;embly towards <HI>Ni&s;mes,</HI> where he &s;aw the &s;torm was like to fall, and where his pre&s;ence would be mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary; and conceiving it al&s;o a very convenient place for the General A&s;&s;em|bly, made no long delays after his arrival there, before he form|ed it.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t and mo&s;t important affair that fell under their con|&s;ideration, was that of <HI>Ca&s;tres: Saint Germier,</HI> after the depar|ture of the Duke of <HI>Rohan</HI> thence, animated by the Fugitives of <HI>Ca&s;tres,</HI> and importuned by tho&s;e of his Faction, that were left in the Town, whom his Mother, and his Wife, who&s;e Sex priviledged their &s;tay there cheri&s;hed in their di&s;contents, re&s;olves to return thither again, and indeed he him&s;elf was the fourth man that came to the Gate, and meeting with no oppo&s;ition there, he goes up directly to his quarters, where thirty or forty per&s;ons flocking to him, per&s;wade him to go out into the Market-place, a&s;&s;uring him, that all the people would joyn with him, <HI>Chavag|nac,</HI> who was then at Church, having notice of his arrival, rai&s;es his Garri&s;on, commands his own Troop to make ready, and re&s;olves to charge him, wherever he &s;hould meet him; but his Lieutenant, <HI>l' Espuguet,</HI> being very opportunely mounted with about twenty of his men to go out upon a party, hearing the A|larme, goes directly to the place where <HI>Saint Germier</HI> was, and without taking any other notice of him, charged him bravely; in which action he received five wounds, and lo&s;t one of his men; but he &s;lew and wounded many of the others al&s;o, whom he &s;o &s;cattered, and di&s;per&s;ed, that they had no more mind to rally again. Upon this rumour, the Con&s;uls and Con&s;i&s;tory in|terpo&s;e in the bu&s;ine&s;s, and in&s;tead of detaining him pri&s;oner, too charitably mediate for his quiet departure again: This is that which u&s;ually ruines all publick affairs, the indulgence &s;hewen to offenders, under the goodly pretence of piety and clemency, which in other mens matters every one cries out for, when as their own particular intere&s;ts will not endure to hear them mentioned.</P>
<P>This mild comportment of theirs towards <HI>Saint Germier,</HI> in&s;tead of pacifying, renders him more haughty than before, puf|fing him up with a vain opinion, that this courte&s;ie was an effect of their fear; &s;o that encouraged by his followers, and by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of many Thieves, and Villains, that had &s;heltered them&s;elves in <HI>Roque-Courbe,</HI> he gets into it, drives out the Gar|ri&s;on, and makes him&s;elf Ma&s;ter of the place; the A&s;&s;embly General fore-&s;eeing the evil con&s;equences this would pro|duce, &s;ent a Deputy to <HI>Ca&s;tros,</HI> with order to communicato his
<PB N="197" REF="104">
Commi&s;&s;ion to <HI>Chavagnac,</HI> and the Council of the Province, and to endeavour to compo&s;e this difference, by &s;ubmitting it to the determination of Arbitrators; to the end they might not provoke <HI>Saint Germier</HI> to give away the Town; which being now in his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, he laughed at all mentions of an Accommoda|tion; &s;o that the Deputy at his return, reported to the A&s;&s;embly, that all he had been able to do, was to confirm <HI>Roque-Courbe</HI> in their re&s;olutions for the Reformed party, which they had anew engaged them&s;elves by Oath, never to relinqui&s;h; but that for the pre&s;ent it was impo&s;&s;ible to di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;s <HI>Saint Germier</HI> of it; but yet that there was great probability that a little patience, together with his imprudence, would give them what they aimed at; and in effect, a few dayes after, when he urged the Inhabi|tants to declare for the King, who knew well they mu&s;t then &s;ub|mit to a <HI>Romi&s;h</HI> Garri&s;on, they turned many of his Faction out of the Town, which &s;o terrified him, that thinking him&s;elf no longer &s;ecure there, he leaves the place al&s;o, and goes with them to <HI>Cam,</HI> a hou&s;e not far from it; which when <HI>Chavagnac</HI> had intelligence of, he be&s;ieges, and takes him, and one of his bro|thers, with fifteen, or &s;ixteen others, half <HI>Romanists,</HI> and half of the Reformed Religion, whom he &s;ent to the Duke of <HI>Rohan:</HI> And yet after &s;uch actions as the&s;e, found he many Advocates, who deemed it too great a &s;everity to detain him pri&s;oner, till the peace, and &s;eemed al&s;o much di&s;contented that his whole equi|page was not re&s;tored him, and a Troop of Hor&s;e given him, that he might &s;erve the party as formerly, and this was the conclu&s;ion of this affair.</P>
<P>And now the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Mende</HI> renewes the pur&s;uit of his de&s;ign, with an E&s;&s;ay upon <HI>Montauban,</HI> to which end he &s;ent thither <HI>Vieres,</HI> a Gentleman of <HI>Quercy,</HI> who feigned him&s;elf to be of the Religion, and wrote to the Town to this effect, that being now going with the Kings Pa&s;s-port to wait upon the Duke of <HI>Rohan,</HI> with &s;ome propo&s;als tending to the general advantage of them all, he would not proceed in his journey before he had acquainted them with them, which if they plea&s;ed to receive from his Relation, he was confident they would approve of them.</P>
<P>It was not thought fit to admit him into the Town, for fear of the danger might en&s;ue; but yet the natural curio&s;ity of the <HI>French,</HI> at &s;uch a time, when every one breathed nothing but de|&s;ires of a peace; made them very &s;ollicitous to know what he had to &s;ay: Wherefore they &s;ent four Commi&s;&s;ioners to receive his me&s;&s;age, whom he told, that being of the Religion him&s;elf, he could not but be very zealous for the general welfare of their
<PB N="198" REF="105">

<P>The Duke of <HI>Rohan</HI> had great jealou&s;ies of this <HI>Vieres,</HI> whom he had a long time I nown for a notable cheat; neverthe|le&s;s, with great impatience was this Addre&s;s expected; the report of which being generally divulged, &s;u&s;pended all other thoughts, every one hoping to derive &s;ome advantage from it; three weeks pa&s;&s;ed without any further mention of it, at length came a di&s;patch from <HI>Montauban,</HI> importing, that they had receiv'd intelligence from the Bi&s;hop, that he could not obtain the Pa&s;s-ports promi&s;ed by <HI>Vieres;</HI> but that if they plea&s;ed to &s;end their Deputies to per&s;wade the General A&s;&s;embly to accept of &s;uch a peace, as the King &s;hould vouch&s;afe to accord them, and in ca&s;e they refu&s;ed to comply, that they them&s;elves were re&s;olved to &s;ubmit to his plea&s;ure, he vvould engage him&s;elf for the &s;afe conduct of their Deputies: This di&s;covered the vvhole fallacy to the Tovvn, and made them re&s;olve anevv to remit all propo&s;itions for peace to the General A&s;&s;embly, vvhich they exactly ob&s;erved in that, made them by the Mar&s;hal <HI>de la Force,</HI> to this effect, that the King vvas re&s;olved not to i&s;&s;ue out any Declaration for a general peace; neverthele&s;s, if they vvould Treat every one particularly, the King admitting of all &s;uch Treaties, and refu&s;ing a peace to no Tovvn, it vvould at la&s;t in&s;en&s;ibly prove a general one.</P>
<P>When this bu&s;ine&s;s of <HI>Montauban</HI> vvas over, came a very ur|gent di&s;patch from <HI>Vivaretz,</HI> grounded upon this occa&s;ion, that the Army vvhich lay before <HI>Rochelle,</HI> after the taking of the Tovvn, vvent under the command of <HI>Toiras</HI> into <HI>Auvergne,</HI> to refre&s;h them&s;elves, and that they were now upon a March to|wards the upper <HI>Vivaretz,</HI> to go thence to <HI>Valence</HI> in <HI>Dauphine,</HI> there to wait the arrival of the King; this their &s;o near approach, gave the whole Countrey a hot Alarme; e&s;pecially <HI>Sojon,</HI> which <HI>Chevrilles</HI> about &s;ix Moneths before had &s;eized, and for|tified; &s;o that with great in&s;tancy they demanded a &s;upply both of men and ammunition. The lower <HI>Languedoc</HI> furni&s;hed them with fifteen hundred men, the command of which was given by the Dake of <HI>Rohan</HI> to <HI>Saint Andr&eacute; de Montbrun</HI> as his field

<P>In the mean time came to him new a&s;&s;urances from <HI>England,</HI> that he &s;hould never be de&s;erted, nor any peace made, without compri&s;ing the whole body of tho&s;e of the Religion in <HI>France</HI> in general, and his Family in particular; encouraging him al&s;o to a con&s;tancy in his re&s;olution, and not to be di&s;mayed at the lo&s;s of <HI>Rochelle:</HI> Prince <HI>Thomas</HI> al&s;o of <HI>Savoy</HI> &s;ent a Gentle|man to him, to let him know, that if he continued in his former humour, and would advance towards him, he would give the King a hand&s;ome diver&s;ion in <HI>Dauphine,</HI> and meet him upon the <HI>Rhone</HI> with ten thou&s;and Foot, and a thou&s;and Hor&s;e; to whom he replied, that he was now in a better humour than ever, and

ready to march upon the fir&s;t &s;ummons he &s;hould receive from him.</P>
<P>The King in the mean time goes towards <HI>Dauphine,</HI> but becau&s;e the plague was at <HI>Lyons</HI> Lodges at <HI>Vienne,</HI> and appoints the Rendez-vous to be at <HI>Grenoble,</HI> where preparation was al&s;o made of all things nece&s;&s;ary for the relief and victualling of <HI>Cazal;</HI> the jealou&s;ies the&s;e preparatives rai&s;ed in the Duke of <HI>Savoy,</HI> made him look about him in &s;everal quarters, there being an Army in Province ready to fall upon <HI>Nice;</HI> another in <HI>Bre&s;&s;ia</HI> to keep <HI>Sa|voy</HI> in awe, and the King him&s;elf marching with the third to the &s;treights of <HI>Su&s;a,</HI> which is the Key of <HI>Piedmont;</HI> &s;o that the Duke was fain to divide his Forces, that he might be ready to de|fend him&s;elf in any part where the &s;torm &s;hould fall, and to call in the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Forces to a&s;&s;i&s;t him in the defence of <HI>Su&s;a.</HI></P>
<P>The pre&s;ent &s;tate of affairs, gave great probabilities that the King would now have employments enough to divert him a long time from looking after tho&s;e of the Religion; and upon occa&s;i|on of &s;ome reports di&s;per&s;ed among the people of <HI>Ni&s;mes,</HI> that if they had any inclinations to &s;ue for a peace, all nece&s;&s;ary Pa&s;s|ports for their &s;afe conduct &s;hould be given them; the A&s;&s;embly took care to enquire after the Authours, and truth of the&s;e Ru|mours; but finding them to be all fictions, and the inventions of &s;ome Coun&s;ellours of the Pre&s;idial of <HI>Ni&s;mes,</HI> or of &s;ome of the Inhabitants that had been expul&s;ed the Town; or of &s;ome of <HI>Aiguemortes,</HI> &s;ome of them &s;et on by the Duke of <HI>Montmorency,</HI> others by the Marque&s;s of <HI>Varennes,</HI> out of an intention to ruine them, by &s;owing divi&s;ions among them, rather than to procure them any good; the A&s;&s;embly made a Decree, that all per&s;ons that had any propo&s;als or overtures to make for a peace, &s;hould fir&s;t bring them to the A&s;&s;embly, that they might be examined by them, and improved to their advantage; expre&s;&s;ely prohibiting al&s;o all per&s;ons from &s;uch clande&s;tine, and malicious buzzing of reports among the people, to take them off from proceeding in the Forti|fications they were then upon.</P>
<P>And next they fell upon the con&s;ideration of a cour&s;e to procure a firm and la&s;ting peace; whereupon they laid down this for an in|fallible ground, that it could not be &s;uch, unle&s;s it were made conjoyntly with the King of <HI>England;</HI> neither could he him|&s;elf procure any upon &s;o good terms, without a previous di&s;cent into <HI>France,</HI> whither he was now invited by &s;o many con&s;iderable emergencies to favour him in the enterpri&s;e; the King being now at the other end of his Kingdom with his be&s;t Forces, pro&s;ecuting a de&s;ign, was to be executed without it; where he &s;hould have to

oppo&s;e him, the Forces of the Emperour, the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> and the Duke of <HI>Savoy.</HI> To this effect a letter was written to him in the name of the A&s;&s;embly, and the Duke of <HI>Rohan,</HI> be&s;eeching him to embrace this offered opportunity, and confirming the pro|te&s;tations formerly made by tho&s;e of the Religion in <HI>France,</HI> not to engage in any Treaty, but conjoyntly with him: And for as much as their want of money was great, and that without &s;ome Forrain a&s;&s;i&s;tance, it was impo&s;&s;ible to keep their men together, or advance their Fortifications, the Duke of <HI>Rohan</HI> was &s;ollici|ted to write to <HI>Clau&s;el,</HI> that they could no longer &s;ub&s;i&s;t without a &s;upply of money, and that he &s;hould let the <HI>Spaniards</HI> know, that the peace of <HI>France</HI> could be no longer prevented, without a &s;udden recruit. It was al&s;o re&s;olved, that they &s;hould endeavour to procure &s;ome private Pa&s;s-ports, that they might with more &s;ecurity &s;end into <HI>England;</HI> upon a&s;&s;urance to be given to di&s;|po&s;e all things to a peace: <HI>Du Cros</HI> of <HI>Montpellier,</HI> who, with the con&s;ent of the Marque&s;s <HI>de Fo&s;&s;e,</HI> came to give the Duke of <HI>Rohan</HI> a vi&s;it, returned from him with the &s;ame promi&s;e, which was al&s;o confirmed by the whole A&s;&s;embly.</P>
<P>Thus were they careful not to omit any thing that tended ei|ther to their own defence, or the procuring of a peace, even at &s;uch a time, when they had fairer hopes of good &s;ucce&s;s in their affairs than ever; but God, who had otherwi&s;e determined of them, bla&s;ted all their projects: For the King, who left not <HI>Paris,</HI> to go to the relief of <HI>Cazal,</HI> till he had privately gotten an a&s;&s;urance out of <HI>England,</HI> which freed him from the fear of any inva&s;ion thence, whil'&s;t he was engaged in that expedition, and made him confident of a peace with that Nation, excluding the Reformed Party, would not admit of any addre&s;&s;es from them, fearing le&s;t they might prevail &s;o far upon him, as to induce him to alter his determinations concerning them: To which may be added, that &s;urprizing his enemies by a nimble march, in the dead of Winter, he ea&s;ily gained the &s;traits of <HI>Su&s;a,</HI> and imme|diatly after the Town al&s;o; which brought &s;o great a terrour on them all, that <HI>Don Ganzales</HI> rai&s;ed his &s;iege from before <HI>Cazal;</HI> the Duke of <HI>Savoy</HI> al&s;o, to prevent the lo&s;s of <HI>Piedmont,</HI> folli|cited for a peace, by which he was obliged to re-victual <HI>Cazal</HI> The King, that he might him&s;elf witne&s;s the performance of all Conventions, remained about a moneth longer in that Coun|trey: And then leaving <HI>Toiras</HI> with four thou&s;and Foot, and five hundred Hor&s;e in <HI>Montferrat,</HI> and the Mar&s;hal <HI>Crequi</HI> with the like number at <HI>Su&s;a,</HI> bent all his thoughts, and the re&s;t of his Forces upon the War in <HI>Languedoc;</HI> in order to which he commanded the Mar&s;hal <HI>Schomberg</HI> to advance before to <HI>Valence,</HI>

<P>In the interim of the&s;e preparations the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Emba&s;&s;a|dour than re&s;iding at <HI>Thurin,</HI> gave the Duke of <HI>Rohan</HI> notice of the peace concluded there; but that it was not like to be of any long continuance; that the Army was now marching towards him, but in &s;o tattered a condition, that if he could but &s;tand the fir&s;t &s;hock, he would &s;oon find &s;uch diver&s;ions made, as would be much to his advantage. <HI>Clau&s;el</HI> encouraged him yet much more with promi&s;es of a &s;udden &s;upply both of Arms and Money. <HI>Ni&s;mes,</HI> and <HI>Aimargues</HI> went but &s;lowly on in their Fortificati|ons, <HI>V&s;ez</HI> a little better; but yet no Town would give quarter to any Souldiers, till they were upon the point of being be&s;ieged; which drove the Duke of <HI>Rohan</HI> to his u&s;ual way of offering to each particular Town to pull out for them, the Thorn, that pricked them: And fir&s;t he addre&s;&s;es him&s;elf to <HI>Sauve,</HI> with over-tures of an attempt upon <HI>Cor&s;onne,</HI> whither he goes; but findes it a matter of greater difficulty, than his information had given him cau&s;e to apprehend; for having battered their Works, the Walls were not to be &s;caled, but with Ladders of a very great length; &s;o that tho&s;e he had brought with him proving too &s;hort, he was nece&s;&s;itated to make all new again; which gave the Mar|&s;hal <HI>d' Estr&eacute;e,</HI> (urged by the Marque&s;s <HI>de Fo&s;&s;e</HI>) lea&s;ure to march to the relief of it with &s;ix thou&s;and Foot, and four hun|dred Hor&s;e; whereupon the Duke drew off again to <HI>Sauve;</HI> and the next day being de&s;irous to view the Mar&s;hal's Army as it marched, and who then took up their quarters at <HI>Sommieres;</HI> it was demon&s;trated to him, that he could not get back again to <HI>Saint Gilles,</HI> but he mu&s;t pa&s;s the <HI>Vistre</HI> near to <HI>Aimargues;</HI> or the <HI>Gardon,</HI> if he intended to go for <HI>Vivaretz,</HI> as it was repor|ted he did, at both which places he might with ea&s;e be di&s;cove|red, and with advantage fought with: The Duke, that he might not lo&s;e this opportunity, writes to <HI>V&s;ez</HI> for &s;ome more Forces,

<P>This was the i&s;&s;ue of this action, in which the Duke of <HI>Ro|han</HI> was very like to have received a check, would have proved fatal both to him&s;elf, and his Party too: But now imagining that it was not without cau&s;e that the Mar&s;hal &s;o earne&s;tly pur|&s;ued this de&s;ign; but that his Forces were intended for the Countrey about <HI>Ni&s;mes,</HI> he conceived he would again pa&s;s the <HI>Vi&s;tre</HI> near <HI>Aimargues,</HI> that he might the &s;ooner recover his quarters at <HI>Saint Gilles,</HI> which made him de&s;irous yet once more to &s;ee him; for which purpo&s;e he took two thou&s;and of the Foot of <HI>Ni&s;mes,</HI> and his Hor&s;e, with whom he came to <HI>Aimar|gues;</HI> the next day he drew them up in a place between <HI>Aimar|gues</HI> and the Pa&s;s, with intention to charge him when he &s;hould be half over; which the Mar&s;hal having notice of, he changed both his de&s;ign, and road, and lengthning his way a dayes journey, pa&s;&s;ed the River at <HI>Aiguemortes;</HI> and the Duke retur|ned to <HI>Ni&s;mes:</HI> And &s;eeing the preparations were making on all hands for the inva&s;ion of the lower <HI>Languedoc,</HI> and the <HI>Se|venes,</HI> he got the Towns of the lower <HI>Languedoc</HI> to receive their Gari&s;ons; a&s;&s;ignes the Regiments of <HI>Goudin, Fourniquet,</HI> and <HI>Bonal,</HI> to <HI>Ni&s;mes;</HI> tho&s;e of <HI>la Baume</HI> and <HI>Faulgeres</HI> for <HI>U&s;ez;</HI> and that of <HI>Sandres</HI> for <HI>Aimargues;</HI> After this, and the taking of the Fort of <HI>Sojon</HI> by the Duke of <HI>Montmorency,</HI> which co&s;t him but three dayes time, though <HI>Chevrilles</HI> had promi&s;ed to hold it out three weeks, the Duke of <HI>Rohan</HI> having learnt the particulars of the Treaty for <HI>Vivaretz,</HI> made by <HI>Chevrilles</HI> with the Keeper of the &s;eals for twenty thou&s;and Crowns; he thought it now high time to look after the &s;ecuring of it; and &s;ent <HI>Saint Andr&eacute; de Montbrun</HI> with five hundred Foot, and &s;ome of <HI>Ca&s;|&s;agne</HI>'s Hor&s;e, to <HI>Privas,</HI> whither he got very happily, having defeated <HI>Montreal</HI> and <HI>l' E&s;trange,</HI> who waited for him at &s;ome untoward pa&s;&s;es in his way, with a farre greater &s;trength than his.

<P>After that the Cardinal was come up to them, they more clo&s;ely blocked up the place on every &s;ide, made their approa|ches and batteries, and then gave it an a&s;&s;ault, from which they were bravely beaten off with the lo&s;s of many of their men; yet did this &s;torm &s;o terrifie the be&s;ieged, that they in|&s;tantly urge <HI>Saint Andr&eacute;</HI> to give <HI>Gordes</HI> another meeting: But in his room was &s;ub&s;tituted, and &s;ent <HI>Vennes</HI> a Captain in the Regiment of the Guards, who offered him very honourable terms for him&s;elf, and the Souldiers, but nothing at all for the Inha|bitants; all which he refu&s;ed, prote&s;ting that he would never de&s;ert them: When <HI>Saint Andr&eacute;,</HI> at his return, gave the peo|ple of the Town an account of the interview, it &s;truck &s;o great a terrour into them, together with tho&s;e of <HI>Vivaretz,</HI> that they all quit the Town, and flie to <HI>Boutieres,</HI> leaving <HI>Saint Andr&eacute;</HI> with five hundred men only to defend a place, which was not to be maintained under two thou&s;and.

<P>The lo&s;s of <HI>Privas,</HI> from whence was expected a longer op|po&s;ition, &s;urprized the whole Party with terrour and amazement; and put the Duke of <HI>Rohan</HI> in mind, that it was now high time to go to the <HI>Sevenes,</HI> to take Order for the &s;ecurity of that Pro|vince, and to oppo&s;e the fir&s;t attempts that &s;hould be made up|on it: This Voyage was hitherto retarded by his fear to leave <HI>Ni&s;mes</HI> (which many endeavoured to &s;educe from its fidelity) till he had &s;upplied it with Souldiers, which, untill compelled by nece&s;&s;ity, they would not receive; and withall by rea&s;on that having re&s;olved to leave <HI>Leques</HI> there to command in chief, in ca&s;e it &s;hould be be&s;ieged, he dur&s;t not di&s;cover his intentions in that particular too &s;oon, becau&s;e he knew that <HI>Aubais</HI> aimed at the &s;ame command, and that he endeavoured by &s;ecret pra|ctices to render <HI>Leques</HI> odious to the people, and make him&s;elf to be de&s;ired by them: In the like perplexity was he for <HI>U&s;ez,</HI> where <HI>Goudin</HI> ambitioned the Government, but was ab&s;olutely refu&s;ed by the Inhabitants: Neverthele&s;s, at length he &s;ets out from <HI>Ni&s;mes,</HI> goes to <HI>U&s;ez,</HI> and thence takes <HI>Faulgiere</HI>'s Regi|ment with him to <HI>Aletz,</HI> and thence put it into <HI>Saint Ambroix,</HI> in hopes that the oppo&s;ition that place would make, would give him more lea&s;ure to provide for the <HI>Sevenes,</HI> where he thought to have found a good &s;um of money ready rai&s;ed, out of &s;ome Farms he had engaged for his Leavies; but the apprehen&s;ion of the King's coming into tho&s;e parts, made mo&s;t of the Farmers refu&s;e to disbur&s;e any: Upon their default he propo&s;ed another expedient, that the Bayliffs &s;hould advance the money for the Leavies, and that, for their re-imbur&s;ement both of the Principal

<P>In the mean time the Mar&s;hal <HI>d' E&s;tr&eacute;e,</HI> and the Duke of <HI>Trimo&uuml;ille</HI> began to ravage the Countrey about <HI>Ni&s;mes,</HI> where there pa&s;&s;ed many hand&s;ome skirmi&s;hes, in which, tho&s;e of the Town (who killed and wounded twelve or fifteen hundred of the enemy) had alwayes the better, except one day, when &s;ome of the Inhabitants, too incon&s;iderately advancing, were &s;urprized by the Hor&s;e, who dealt &s;o roughly with them, that, be&s;ides tho&s;e which were wounded, there remained forty dead upon the place, and had not <HI>Leques</HI> come in with fre&s;h Troops, there had been much more mi&s;chief done: For his own part he was &s;orced from his Hor&s;e, which was killed under him; but the Forragers came not within Canon-&s;hot of the Town.</P>
<P>The King on his &s;ide lo&s;es no time, but after the taking of <HI>Privas,</HI> &s;ends part of his Army towards <HI>Gorce</HI> and <HI>Barjac,</HI> which were given up into his hands: <HI>Beauvoir</HI> and <HI>Saint Florent</HI> make their peace, and then turn Brokers for the places belonging to the Reformed Party: The former of them comes to <HI>Saint Am|broix,</HI> to per&s;wade the Inhabitants, to imitate the example of <HI>Barjac;</HI> which the chiefe&s;t of them were &s;o ready to con&s;ent un|to, that, had not the Souldiers interpo&s;ed, the thing had been then done: Neverthele&s;s they continue their corre&s;pondencies, &s;o that upon the King's approach, though he had no Canon with him, nor could have any come up to him within eight or ten dayes, fear united the two Factions in the Town, who be|fore were at mortal odds, and both together force the Souldiery to a compliance with them, &s;o that the Capitulation was agreed on, upon condition that the Souldiers &s;hould no more beare armes for the Reformed party: At which Article, when one of the Captains &s;crupled, the Duke of <HI>Montmorency</HI> told him, that none ever treated with the King upon any other termes, but that it was but a formality only, and obliged no man farther than he plea&s;ed him&s;elf: And then flatters one, and another, with promi&s;es of great rewards, if they would repaire to <HI>Aletz,</HI> and &s;erve the King there, by joyning with the Count of <HI>Aletz,</HI> who had promi&s;ed to give him up the Town: Thither then marched all the Souldiers from <HI>Saint Ambroix,</HI> where they excu&s;e them|&s;elves by revolving all the blame upon the Inhabitants, who compelled them to yield the place; promi&s;ing withall, that not|with&s;tanding

<P>After this the Duke &s;ent for <HI>Caudiac,</HI> a Coun&s;ellor in the Chamber of <HI>Languedoc,</HI> who had already made &s;everal journies to the Court, in order to a Peace, and was now but newly re|turned thence; where he found that their only aime, and chiefe&s;t hopes now, were, a total di&s;&s;ipation of the party by particular Treaties; him he de&s;ires once again to return thither, and to tell the Cardinal <HI>de Richelieu</HI> from him, that he was a faithful Sub|ject of the Kings, that he de&s;ired nothing more, than the Tran|quillity of the State, and the Repo&s;e of his own party; and with, all, that both he, and the greate&s;t part of them, would expo&s;e them&s;elves and fortunes to all extremities, rather than &s;ubmit to any Peace, but &s;uch as &s;hould be General, and Conformable to the former Edicts of pacification; that it was a thing of dange|rous con&s;equence to force an armed Party, how &s;mall &s;oever, from all hopes of &s;afety, but what they ground upon their de&s;pair of any; and that if the King would vouch&s;afe to admit of a Gene|ral Treaty, and allow the General A&s;&s;embly but four dayes time only to remove from <HI>Ni&s;mes</HI> to <HI>Anduze,</HI> and Pa&s;s ports for the

<P>In the mean time every one is very &s;ollicitous to draw his own particular advantage out of this &s;mall interval: The Kings party continue their practices in the Province; but with greate&s;t ardour pro&s;ecute they the de&s;ign of <HI>Sauve,</HI> whither, when <HI>Randon</HI> came with the four hundred Souldiers, the di&s;affected, to exa&s;perate the others, oppre&s;s them with quartering, and that they might di&s;gu&s;t the people with an apprehen&s;ion of the Duke's under|valuing of them, quarrel at the per&s;on of <HI>Randon,</HI> as a man of too mean quality to command them; and when, according to his Orders he would have mingled his Souldiers with the Inhabi|tants, to &s;trengthen their Guarders in all quarters, they would by no means &s;uffer it in the Ca&s;tle, but loudly objected their priviledges again&s;t that procedure, as an infringement of them; a prevalent motive to work the populace to any thing; &s;o that upon this ill u&s;age of theirs, <HI>Randon,</HI> unadvi&s;edly told them, that in ca&s;e they refu&s;ed him the ab&s;olute command of their Town, he had Orders from the Duke of <HI>Rohan</HI> to quit it upon the approach of the King's Army: This incon&s;iderate expre&s;&s;ion, &s;o indi&s;creet|ly let fall by him, and as nimbly taken up by the di&s;affected of the Town, had like to have ruined all; for they publi&s;hed &s;trange Coments on it to the people, crying out, that the Duke had &s;ent them men to abandon them, when they &s;hould mo&s;t &s;tand in need of their a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and that de&s;ired only to po&s;&s;e&s;s them&s;elves of their &s;trength, at their co&s;t, to purcha&s;e them&s;elves better con|ditions; &s;o that upon occa&s;ion of the&s;e jealou&s;ies they called a Council, at which they re&s;olved, to die all, rather than admit any &s;tranger into their Ca&s;tle.</P>
<P>In the mid'&s;t of their deliberations came letters from the Duke of <HI>Rohan</HI> to convoque the Provincial A&s;&s;embly at <HI>Anduze,</HI> to con|&s;ult upon &s;ome Articles for a general peace; which mollified them &s;o, that they nominated Deputies to &s;end thither: But when the Council was di&s;&s;olved, the di&s;affected exclaim again&s;t this as a trick of the Duke of <HI>Rohan</HI> to defeat their particular Treaty, and to &s;urprize, and detain their principal Citizens at <HI>Anduze,</HI> until they delivered up their fortre&s;&s;es into his hands: whereupon they thought fit to &s;end away the next day, but one Deputy only to &s;ound the forde, and give them notice how things were carried,

<HI>Aletz,</HI> he imparted to him the great hopes conceived of a Gene|ral Peace, to which he gave no other reply than only, <HI>God grant it;</HI> but turning his di&s;cour&s;e to the Captain, that convoyed <HI>Ro&s;|&s;el,</HI> he told him, that the Duke of <HI>Rohan</HI> had too long abu&s;ed them by his policies, and that he endeavoured yet to amu&s;e them with hopes of a General Peace, but only to fru&s;trate their Communalty of the advantageous conditions they might receive from a particular Treaty; but that they were now re&s;olv'd to give no further credit to him, knowing that all his talks of a General Peace was nothing but meer delu&s;ion, whereupon the Captain took him pri&s;oner, and carried him with him to <HI>Anduze.</HI></P>
<P>When <HI>Ro&s;&s;el</HI> came back to the Duke of <HI>Rohan,</HI> he gave the Duke an account of his negotiation, telling him, that all his en|deavours had no other effect than only &s;omewhat to a&s;&s;wage the tumour, untill he in per&s;on &s;hould provide a better remedy for it; whereupon he immediately departed thence, and went towards <HI>Sauve:</HI> His arrival there much daunted the di&s;affected party; but they were now &s;o farre advanced, that they knew not well, how to recede from their engagements: The &s;econd Con&s;ul fled to the Ca&s;tle; the Duke &s;ent to command him thence, which &s;um|mons he dur&s;t not di&s;obey: When he was come thence, and the re&s;t of the Council were a&s;&s;embled, that Duke acquainted them with the four dayes liberty he had obtained, for the adjourning of the general A&s;&s;embly to <HI>Anduze;</HI> that he hoped to procure them &s;uch a peace, as &s;hould redound to their general welfare, provided, that, renouncing all diffidence and jealou&s;ies one of an|other, they pre&s;erved an entire unity among them&s;elves; that he had borne armes the&s;e eight years pa&s;t, upon no other de&s;ign, but the defence of their Religion and Liberties; for which he had as cleare a zeal, as any of them; but that now he was to know of them, whether they would own him for their General or no, and as &s;uch would obey him; whereupon the people crying our, that they would &s;ubmit to him, he re&s;umed his di&s;cour&s;e, tel|ling them that he would then go to the Ca&s;tle, and place there &s;uch of the Inhabitants as he &s;hould think fit: The Con&s;uls at fir&s;t refu&s;ed to follow him, pretending, that &s;ince they were not confided in, they would quit their Offices; neverthele&s;s when they &s;aw him go up to the Ca&s;tle, and that all the people flocked after, they &s;tayed not long behind him, who, when he had tur|ned out, the Guard was then in it, made choice of &s;uch a num|ber of the Town&s;men, as he thought &s;ufficient to keep it, obli|ging them by Oath to maintain it under the authority of their Con&s;uls, and for the general good of the whole party, again&s;t all per&s;ons what&s;oever; which gave great &s;atisfaction to the people;

/pg and when he had left in their Town a thou&s;and men, drawn from <HI>Saint Hippolyte, Vigan,</HI> and other places, he returned the &s;ame day to <HI>Anduze.</HI></P>
<P>The news of this came to <HI>Aletz</HI> as &s;oon as <HI>Caudiac,</HI> and &s;o net|led the King's Council, that they exclaimed again&s;t the Duke of <HI>Rohan</HI> for breach of promi&s;e, &s;aying, that the King had not &s;tir|red from <HI>Aletz,</HI> but that the Duke had been at <HI>Sauve,</HI> where he had &s;ecured, and furni&s;hed the Ca&s;tle, and the Towers, with &s;oul|diers; neverthele&s;s they gave him Orders to return with all &s;peed to the A&s;&s;embly, but told him withall, that the King would not be obliged to any further &s;tay at <HI>Aletz; Caudiac,</HI> who clearly &s;aw that all this choler flowed only from the defeat of their de&s;ign upon <HI>Sauve,</HI> replied, that the Duke had not bound him&s;elf by a|ny engagement not to &s;tir from <HI>Anduze,</HI> but not to make any at|tempt upon the Towns of the adver&s;e Party; and that to provide for his own, could not be interpreted any breach of promi&s;e: Af|ter this he went to the A&s;&s;embly, whom he found much perplexed about the Article concerning the demolition of their fortificati|ons; for that, be&s;ides the Deputies formerly &s;ent by them to the A&s;&s;embly, the Towns of <HI>Ni&s;mes</HI> and <HI>U&s;ez</HI> had &s;ent others purpo&s;e|ly to oppo&s;e that Article, and, if it were po&s;&s;ible, to draw in tho&s;e of the <HI>Sevenes</HI> to fortifie them in that oppo&s;ition.</P>
<P>Whereupon it was thought fit, before they proceeded to any conclu&s;ion, that they &s;hould have the opinion of the Provincial A&s;|&s;embly of the <HI>Sevenes,</HI> that accordingly they might order their re|&s;olutions; But that A&s;&s;embly would determine nothing in it, with|out the advice of the Common-Council of the Town of <HI>Anduze,</HI> which they looked upon as a place the mo&s;t concerned in the &s;ub&s;i&s;tance of the new-rai&s;ed buildings, and fortifications, and mo&s;t re&s;olute to defend them: The Council reported their opi|nion to the Provincial, and the Provincial to the general A&s;&s;em|bly; the &s;um of which, was, that con&s;idering the ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;i|ty that lay upon them, they &s;hould choo&s;e Commi&s;&s;ioners to Treat about a peace, and that the management of the Article concerning the fortifications, &s;hould be referred to their di&s;cretions.</P>
<P>The A&s;&s;embly general, unwilling to undergo the whole burthen of the Treaty, a&s;&s;ociate with them the new extraordinary Depu|ties of <HI>Ni&s;mes</HI> and <HI>U&s;ez,</HI> and a like number of the Provincial A&s;|&s;embly of the <HI>Sevenes,</HI> who altogether re&s;olved to &s;end their De|puties to the King to demand a peace, and to moderate that Article the be&s;t they could.</P>
<P>The Deputies ha&s;te away to the Court, where after &s;everal conferences had, they agreed on many things, but at the propo|&s;al of the afore&s;aid Article, the King's Commi&s;&s;ioners would not
<PB N="223" REF="117">
endure the mention of any mitigation of it; but thereupon &s;ent back the Commi&s;&s;ioners, who reported all to the A&s;&s;embly, to whom they plainly di&s;covered that it was in vain to hope for any qualification of that Article, which &s;eemed to be thrown in as a &s;tumbling block among them; whereupon the Town of <HI>Anduze,</HI> and the Province of the <HI>Sevenes,</HI> being again con&s;ulted, they de|mon&s;trated the inevitable ruine of their Province, unle&s;s a &s;udden conclu&s;ion of a General Peace prevented it; for that otherwi&s;e every one was fully re&s;olved to compound for him&s;elf apart; and that the lo&s;s of their Province would certainly draw after it that of the lower <HI>Languedoc;</HI> that the fire was now at their doors, and that they had rather &s;ubmit to that Article, than fail of a Peace.</P>
<P>Whereupon after a full debate of the bu&s;ine&s;s, it was at length concluded that they &s;hould admit of that Article; and thereupon the Deputies were returned fully impowred to Treat, and conclude a peace: Which done, the Duke of <HI>Rohan</HI> de&s;ired the A&s;&s;embly to give their Deputies an expre&s;s charge, that when they had per|fected their Negotiation for the Publick, they &s;hould then mind his particular concernments al&s;o, which they did.</P>
<P>Thus was the Peace concluded at <HI>Aletz,</HI> the 27th. day of <HI>June,</HI> in the year, 1629. The &s;ub&s;tance of the principal Articles of which, was as followeth.</P>

<P>The Town of <HI>V&s;ez</HI> without any he&s;itation at all, accepted the Peace at fir&s;t; &s;o did all <HI>Ro&uuml;ergue,</HI> the higher <HI>Languedoc,</HI> and <HI>Foix;</HI> nor was any place &s;u&s;pected to refu&s;e it, but <HI>Montauban;</HI> where the Prince of <HI>Cond&eacute;</HI> would not cea&s;e his plundering, untill the King had &s;ent him a &s;econd Order to that purpo&s;e; and the Town it &s;elf, as the Cardinal marched that way, declared their acceptance of the General Peace.</P>
<P>This is an account of what pa&s;&s;ed in this la&s;t War, in which the a&s;&s;i&s;tance the Town of <HI>Rochelle</HI> had from <HI>England,</HI> &s;erved only to con&s;ume their provi&s;ions, and draw a Famine on the City; and the vain, and illu&s;ory hopes with which <HI>Spain,</HI> and <HI>Savoy,</HI> abu|&s;ed the lower <HI>Languedoc,</HI> had like to have proved the ruine of the whole Party.</P>
<P>God, of his infinite mercy compa&s;&s;ionating his poor Churches, hath yet intermitted their &s;ufferings, that by a &s;erious repentance of our faults, and a &s;incere amendment of our lives, we might at length attract as many benedictions, as our &s;ins have pulled down calamities on them.</P>
