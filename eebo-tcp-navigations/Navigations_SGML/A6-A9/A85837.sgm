<HEAD TYPE="sub">The humble Petition of <HI>Lionel Gatford.</HI> B.D.</HEAD>
<OPENER>Mo&s;t humbly &s;heweth.</OPENER>
<P>_WHereas your Petitioner, upon your High|ne&s;s gracious di&s;pen&s;ation for the exer|ci&s;ing of his Mini&s;teral function &amp;c. (a favour never to be forgotten by him or his) did indeavour the procuring ad|mi&s;&s;ion into a &s;etled Cure of &s;ouls, but was denied it by &s;ome Commi&s;&s;ioners clayming authority under you. Your Petitioner (being willing to interpret that act of theirs, as well as all things el&s;e that happens to him from men in the mo&s;t charitable &s;en&s;e he can, and knowing Gods hand to rule and over-rule, as he plea&s;eth in the mo&s;t &s;eemingly accidentals among&s;t mortals) began thereupon to con&s;ider with him&s;elf; whether God might not in his mercy de&s;ign him, to what &s;ome men, in too much unkindne&s;s had doo|med him, <HI>viz.</HI> to &s;ome more Apo&s;tolical way of prea|ching, either from hou&s;e to hou&s;e, here in his native Country, or (if he had but the Apo&s;tles gift of tongues) throughout the whole world habitable a|broad. For he could not think, that God had cal|led
<PB REF="3">him to be a mini&s;ter of the Go&s;pel, and inabled him im in &s;ome poor mea&s;ure for it, and honoured him with &s;o long continuance and good &s;ucce&s;s in it (to the prai&s;e of his grace only be it &s;poken) to that end, that, when he had &s;o long &s;erved him, as a pub|like teacher of men, he &s;hould at the la&s;t, end his dayes in the privat teaching of Children; though he undervalues not that his pre&s;ent imployment by preferring that other before it; nor will he receed from it (God inabling and your Highne&s;s permitting him) till he have educated tho&s;e that are or &s;hall be committed to his care and tuition, if their friends &s;hall require it. Whereupon your Petitioner ca&s;ting about and making inquiry, in what Country or Na|tion he might do God mo&s;t &s;ervice; poor neglected de&s;pi&s;ed <HI>Virginea,</HI> and the Engli&s;h Colonie there, with the adjacent heathen inhabitants of the &s;ame continent, came often and often into his thoughts; and his bowels yerned towards them; e&s;pecially, after that he had under&s;tood, from &s;ome men of ho|nour &amp; hone&s;ty, their pre&s;ent &s;ad &s;tate &amp; condition, and the fair hopes and probabilities of doing God and them very much &s;ervice there. Onely the prime <GAP DESC="foreign">, whereby he conceives, he may mo&s;t pru|dentially judge of the likelyhood of his &s;ucce&s;s in undertaking ought for the good and benefit of that people, will be your Highne&s;s a&s;&s;i&s;ting or not a&s;&s;i|&s;ting in the information of what is already experi|mentally found to be the grand hindrances of that co|lonie's pro&s;pering among&s;t them&s;elves, &amp; the main impediments of the Go&s;pel's fart har propagating both among&s;t them&s;elves and among&s;t their neigh|bouring Indians, and are here with humbly pre&s;ented

<PB REF="4">the Gentiles, as well as Gods own I&s;rael, or were otherwi&s;e as well a&s;&s;ured, of the like call; all &s;eeming impo&s;&s;ibilities of doing good, and all af|frighting fears of &s;uffering evill would &s;oon vani&s;h, and he would account it honour &s;ufficient to &s;uffer for Chri&s;t, where his preaching of Chri&s;t, &s;hould be rejected or rendered &s;ucce&s;le&s;s. But, where a Prea|cher is to conclude his call to any people, as well from the door of hope, that is opened to him for his glorifying God, and doing good to men, as from Chri&s;ts inward knocking at the door of his heart by the motions of his holy Spirit (not di&s;cern|able from the impul&s;e of his own Spirit, but by the concurrence of Scriptural exhortations and per&s;wa|&s;ions, or clear deductions from thence, tending to the &s;ame ends without any by ends of his own) there it would be de&s;ervedly reputed little le&s;s than mad|ne&s;s for any to undertake t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">e preaching Chri&s;t to the Heathen, when the wicked lives and unju&s;t per|fidious, cruel, bloody practi&s;es of tho&s;e, that call them&s;elves Chri&s;tians, and profe&s;s the &s;ame faith with that Preacher, lye in the door, and barr up the way again&s;t his entering into them and their open|ing unto him: and it would be more po&s;&s;ible for him to remove Mountains, than any to remove that im|pediment of &s;candel, unle&s;s your Highne&s;s &s;et to your helping hand, and reform by your power and authority, derived to &s;ome pious prudent, upright Governour under you, as well as the Mini&s;ters of the Colonie indeavour it, by their faithfull preach|ing and holy conver&s;ation.</P>

<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rev. cap. 2. and 3.</NOTE> and pull &s;corn and contempt upon him&s;elf for his weakne&s;s and apo&s;tacie, and render the work it &s;elf for the more difficult and dreadfull to others, that would happily otherwi&s;e have laboured &s;uc|ce&s;sfully in it. Now for the co&s;t of this pre&s;ent undertaking its ea&s;i to be valued, &s;o far as it yet concerns me: For all that I undertake, is but the repre&s;enting of the pre&s;ent &s;ad
<PB REF="5">condition of the Engli&s;h Colonie in <HI>Virginea,</HI> with the ra|tional cau&s;es thereof, and the probable means of its relief and redre&s;s, unto one, that is known to have &s;ufficiency both of skill and power, and what el&s;e is requi&s;ite for effecting and accompli&s;hing what is humbly de&s;ired of him, or &s;oberly intimated to him. And although this co&s;t me &s;omewhat more, both in expence of time and labour, for the compo&s;ing and framing both the Petition and the Re|mon&s;trance than to merit the ambitious time-crack of be|ing auto&s;chedia&s;tical or <HI>extempore</HI> (for I dare not pre&s;ent ought to man, that co&s;t me nothing) yet it co&s;t me &s;o little, that I think it not worth the computing. For &s;ome Plan|ters in and Traders to <HI>Virginea,</HI> that are of known credit and reputation, furni&s;hed me with the collections, and o|ther Per&s;ons of honour undertook the procuring both them and my Petition acce&s;s to his Highne&s;s; and if I have, or can thereby but lay the foundation of an happy reformation of that declining Plantation, the honour of proceeding &s;o far, will, in my account and in the e&s;timate of all hone&s;t men, much outweigh the &s;coffs and mocks of all <HI>Sanballats</HI> or <HI>Tobiahs</HI> that &s;hall malign the fini&s;hing of the building. And I hope God will &s;tirr up the Spirits of &s;ome zealous <HI>Haggais</HI> and <HI>Zachariahs</HI> to incite and incourage &s;ome noble Heroick <HI>Zerubbabels</HI> and <HI>Jo&s;huas</HI> to perfect what &s;hall be left unfini&s;hed by tho&s;e worthies, whom I, that am le&s;s than the lea&s;t of the Lords Prophets, and unworthy to be called a Prophet, have called upon and incited to ap|pear in this honourable and pious work. And for what mine own fle&s;h and blood could object again&s;t this un|dertaking, though the objections were many and &s;eeming|ly &s;trong (e&s;pecially when they were backed by others, that would have made me believe, they love me as well as I can my &s;elf) yet God (to the glory of his grace be it &s;poken) ina|bled
<PB REF="6">me either to remove or leap over them all: and I was, and am confident, that &s;eeing I do not in this work &s;eek my &s;elf, but the glory of God, and the good of &s;o many &s;oules, if I &s;hould chance to lo&s;e my &s;elf in it, I &s;hould finde my &s;elf and that both infinitely comforted in that lo&s;s, and &s;uper|abundantly recompenced for it. The chief thing then, that remaines to be done by me, is the arming my &s;elf, or rather the daily &s;upplicating of God to arm me, again&s;t the fiery darts, that Satan and his complices, wicked men, &s;hall ca&s;t at me to beat me off from this work, or to affright me in it. And (prai&s;ed be the Lord) I have been &s;o acquainted with their envy and detraction, the two prime poy&s;onous bar|bed arrowes of their Helli&s;h quiver, in &s;ome other under|takings, that God hath honoured me with, and carried me through; that I onely &s;o far fear them and the re&s;t of that invenomed &s;heaf, as to betake me to the armour which the Lord of ho&s;ts hath coun&s;elled me to make u&s;e of again&s;t them, and to apply me to tho&s;e holy means which he hath pre&s;cribed both for the getting that armour and the girting it on, as al&s;o for the exerci&s;ing and managing it to the be&s;t advantage. I know that envy and detraction are as con&s;tant attendants upon every good action of note and eminency e&s;pecially, as the devill him&s;elf is a diligent ma|licous ob&s;erver of it; that to eat out the very heart of it, if its venemous tooth can reuch it; and this to grangrene &s;ome of the more exteriour u&s;efull comely parts of it, if the vi|tals e&s;cape its poy&s;on. But if God plea&s;e to pre&s;erve the undertaker, and to pro&s;per his undertaking; let the Red Dragon him&s;elf ca&s;t forth a whole flood of poy&s;on after him and that which he travails with, he can no more hurt him or hinder his effecting what he undertakes, than he could the woman cloathed with the &s;un, and her bringing forth her man-child.
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rev. 12.<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter"></NOTE> And for my part, &s;eeing envy makes the
<PB REF="6">be&s;t workes the object of her malignity, <HI>I</HI> &s;hall be &s;o far from being troubled at the envy of any, that I wi&s;h from my heart the work may but prove worthy of &s;uch Spirits envy: And for detraction, if there be &s;o much good in the work, as is capable of mens detracting from it, &s;o that God may have the glory of that good from tho&s;e that have any goodne&s;s in them, let as many wicked ones, as plea&s;e, glory in that their own &s;hame: I &s;hall repute it no &s;hame to me, to have all the glory of all the good taken from me, when there is not the lea&s;t due to me: and it will be honour &s;ufficient, as well as comfort to me, that I have done any thing whereby God may be glorified on my behalf. Yet be|cau&s;e I would not willingly give the lea&s;t occa&s;ion to any to &s;in &s;o highly again&s;t God and their own &s;oules, I &s;hall do my indeavour to prevent all &s;uch folly, &s;o far as a faithfull account of my appearing and proceeding in the bu&s;ine&s;s may do it.</P>
<P>&V;pon what grounds I undertook this work, I have de|clared to him with whom I dare not di&s;&s;emble: And what incouragements I have had, both from God and good men, to go on with it (&s;o far at the lea&s;t as to make tryal how it will be reli&s;hed or di&s;ge&s;ted by tho&s;e who have power either to cru&s;h it or crown it) are fitter for mine own brea&s;t to re|tain, than for this, or any other paper to publi&s;h. This every one, that knowes me, will I hope believe, that certain|ly I had &s;ome friends of worth and credit who furni&s;hed me with the particulars of this Remon&s;trance (as I before hin|ted) or el&s;e being a &s;tranger to <HI>Virginea</HI> and the affaires thereof, I neither could have known them, nor would have rceived any information concerning them upon tru&s;t, much le&s;s have pre&s;umed the pre&s;enting them to his Highne&s;s: And the truth is, There is not one particular mentioned by me, to which I cannot produce a &s;ufficient te&s;timonie for
<PB REF="7">the confirmation thereof, by &s;uch a number of witne&s;&s;es as the Lord him&s;elf approves for the e&s;tabli&s;hing of every truth: And for the mo&s;t they are &s;o well known to every Planter there and trader thither (e&s;pecially tho&s;e that trade in their own per&s;ons) as that he mu&s;t have very little ae|quaintance with either, or give little faith to both, that &s;hall doubt thereof, farther than to enquire of them which all un&s;atisfied per&s;ons are de&s;ired to do. And whereas you will find &s;ome very fowl acts particulari&s;ed, and yet the actors or committors not named; charge that, if you plea&s;e, upon my charity, who though I had their names given me, (as there was rea&s;on I &s;hould) and that by tho&s;e that are neither affraid nor a&s;hamed to have their names known, if it &s;hall be required by any that have authority &s;o to do; Yet I thought it my duty to &s;ilence them; that &s;o the Per&s;ons that are guilty of tho&s;e horrid crimes, may be the &s;ooner invited to repent of them, when they &s;hall &s;ee, that upon their repen|ting, as God hath promi&s;ed their tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions &s;hall not be mentioned unto them by him, nor ought to be by others, &s;o there is the be&s;t cour&s;e taken by me, that I could, that they them&s;elvs &s;hall never be upbraided with them; as knowing, that often times the open di&s;gracing men for &s;ome fowl facts makes them the more impudent in tho&s;e &s;ins, and the more obdurat again&s;t all per&s;wa&s;ions to turn from them.</P>
<P>As al&s;o, that this di&s;covering their &s;ins and yet covering their names may a&s;&s;ure them, that it is the dete&s;tation of tho&s;e crying crimes, not any hatred of their per&s;ons, that occa&s;ioned this complaint: and therefore, if, upon the tel|ling that &s;uch and &s;uch &s;ins are committed by &s;ome, they find them&s;elves to be the men that committed them, (as tis de&s;i|red they may) there will be no need to &s;ay to any of them as <HI>Nathan</HI> &s;ometimes was con&s;treined to &s;ay to <HI>David, Thou art the man:</HI> and if them&s;elves then plea&s;e but to confe&s;s
<PB REF="7">with <HI>David</HI> one by one, I have &s;inned again&s;t the Lord: I &s;hall intercede with the Lord &s;o far as I am able, that he would plea&s;e to &s;ay to their &s;oules, one by one again, what <HI>Nathan</HI> &s;aid to <HI>David, The Lord hath put away thy &s;in:</HI> and if they &s;hall be thus a&s;hamed of what they have done, tis all the &s;hame is wi&s;hed them for &s;o doing. But, becau&s;e by tho&s;e wicked deeds, they have given great occa|&s;ion to the enemies of the Lord to bla&s;pheme, let them be|ware, le&s;t if they do e&s;cape the judgement of men, the &s;evere judgments of God do not &s;eize upon them in &s;ome remarka|ble manner, here in this life, for others to take warning thereby, and for the taking of tho&s;e enemies of the Lord from their farthar bla&s;pheming thereat.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, if all this will not quiet &s;ome Spirits, that &s;hall find them&s;elves concerned in this Remon&s;trance, as concei|ving that the publi&s;hing of &s;uch particular crimes will cau&s;e an inqui&s;ition to be made by many after the particular names of tho&s;e that committed them; (as indeed all men are generally too inqui&s;itive after other mens &s;ins, &amp; too bu|&s;ie in proclaiming them) or it may be, his Highne&s;s him&s;elf may, upon the information of &s;uch crimes heing commited, command the names of tho&s;e that commited them to be gi|ven in to him, that ju&s;tice may proceed again&s;t them; Let &s;uch know, that if any private men &s;hall inquire of me the names of tho&s;e who&s;e particular crimes are complained of in the following Remon&s;trance; I can (through his grace who &s;ets a watch before my mouth and keeps the door of my lips) commond my tongue &s;ilence as well as my pen, but I have no power over the tongues of other men farther than to be&s;eech them to be as carefull of pre&s;erving others good names, as of their own; and that care of others will in|crea&s;e and inlarge the honour of their own: and where any de&s;erve to have their names &s;tink and rot, that they would
<PB REF="8">&s;uffer them &s;o to do, without their raking too much in the noi|&s;om filth &amp; loath&s;ome putridne&s;s &amp; putre of them. But, if his Highne&s;s command me to give him, or any deputed by him, either any or all their names; that &s;o judgement may be executed upon &s;ome of tho&s;e <HI>Zimris</HI> and <HI>Achans,</HI> tho&s;e Colonie-de&s;troying offendors, to the better appea&s;ing of Gods wrath gone out again&s;t that Colonie, and for the more happy prevention of the like provocation by others, I fear the di&s;plea&s;ure both of God and his Highne&s;s too much to di&s;obey that command. And if their names or per&s;ons do &s;uffer thereby, they may blame them&s;elves, who were &s;o audaciou&s;ly wicked as to do that to others without blu&s;hing at it, which now they are a&s;hamed or afraid to hear of, from others, with &s;o much as being named to have done it; and take it ill to have tho&s;e dete&s;table acts of theirs but mentio|ned before one that hath power to puni&s;h them, which they never &s;tuck at to perpetrate before him, that hath power to damn them for them. But I forget my &s;elf and the work in hand too much, in labouring thus long to &s;atisfy tho&s;e that are enemies to both. Apologies to &s;uch do but rai&s;e more jealou&s;ies, and &s;harp rebukes are fitter charms for &s;uch Spi|rits than &s;oft an&s;wers.</P>
<P>There are indeed &s;ome per&s;ons of honour and integrity yet living, that had the unhappine&s;s to be Governours when &s;ome of tho&s;e horrid facts were commited by &s;ome of the Planters; And &s;o they might in ju&s;tice be charged upon their account (&s;o far as the not prohibiting, oppugning, and puni&s;hing them could contract the guilt of them) &s;hould not I be &s;o ju&s;t as to give others that fair account thereof, which I received from tho&s;e who abhor to ju&s;tifie the wick|ed or condemn the righteous. Mo&s;t true it is what <HI>Salu&s;t</HI> &s;aith, That <HI>in cujus manu e&s;t ut prohibeat, jubet agi, &s;i non prohibet admitti,</HI> In who&s;e power it is to prohibit
<PB REF="8">a crime, he commands it to be done, if he do not prohibit the doing it: or, as <HI>Seneca</HI> expre&s;&s;eth it, <HI>qui n on ve|tat peccare cum po&s;&s;it, jubet,</HI> He bids a man to &s;in, that does not forbid him when be may: And he, that does not with&s;tand a wicked man in his wickedne&s;s, or puni&s;h him &s;everely for it, if he have power, does both animat him in his wickedne&s;s, and incourage others to do the like: and is thereby as really guilty of that wickedne&s;s, as if him&s;elf had committed it. But tis as true, (&s;ay their compurgators) that tho&s;e worthies, (who&s;e innocency alone I de&s;ire to vin|dicate, leaving all unworthy Governours to an&s;wer for them&s;elves) had not that ju&s;t power of prohibiting, oppug|ning, and puni&s;hing iniquity and the actors thereof, at lea&s;t not that due liberty of exerci&s;ing their power, that men of their place and authority &s;hould have: but were &s;o limited and bound up, by the over-&s;traightne&s;s of their inve&s;tors, that armed them with that power, or by the di&s;&s;enting of their a&s;&s;i&s;tants, that &s;hould have &s;tood by them, and acted with them, in the execution thereof; or by the in&s;olency and tumultuou&s;ne&s;s of tho&s;e upon whom ju&s;tice &s;hould have been executed, That, although they abhorred &amp; abominated tho&s;e barbarous acts, and the wicked contrivers and actors of them; yet they were con&s;trained, for the better pre&s;ervation of the publik peace and &s;afety of the Plantati|on, as well as their own per&s;ons and &s;ub&s;i&s;tance, to forbear that forcible with&s;tanding, and judicial puni&s;hing them, that they &s;hould, and otherwi&s;e would have practi&s;ed and proceeded in. Such is the in&s;eparable unhaippine&s;s and mi&s;chief that con&s;tantly attends both the Governours and Governed, where the power of the Governors depends upon the favour and plea&s;ure of the people, or is manacled and fettered by any Plebeian Tribunes, or over-awed by any in&s;ulting Ephori.

<P>Towards the Indians.</P>
<P N="1">1. The Planters generally keep neither their word nor their faith with the Indians; whereas the Indians very &s;eldome or
<PB N="6" REF="14">never break their word or faith with them. Thus iniquity is not only folly, but &s;ometimes a vary contradiction to it &s;elf, as well as to rea&s;on; for &s;ome that call them&s;elves believers, are re|al infidels, and prove them&s;elves &s;o to be, and wor&s;e, when &s;ome that are real infidels, prove them&s;elves to have more faith than &s;uch hypocritical believers. And it would be found pre&s;ump|tion, not faith or charity, in any, to believe or hope, that &s;uch di&s;honourers of the Chri&s;tian faith, &s;hould ever prevail with the poor unbelieving Indians to believe Gods word or his promi|&s;es, declared to be his by them who&s;e word and promi&s;e they have ju&s;t cau&s;e not to believe. Or if God &s;hould make &s;uch fowl falls of &s;uch fal&s;e Chri&s;tians to be an occa&s;ion to his own rai&s;ing up tho&s;e unbelieving Indians, &amp; bringing them to Chri&s;t, as he did the falling of the Jewes to be the riches of the gentiles, <HI>Rom.</HI> 11. tis to be feared &s;uch a calling in of tho&s;e Indians, would be the utter ca&s;ting off of tho&s;e Chri&s;tians; which the Lord of his mercy forbid. And for the Indians fidelity to the Engli&s;h, take that for a memorable te&s;timony among&s;t many, and indeed it may &s;tand for many: when the Ma&s;acre was made by the indians upon the Engli&s;h in that Colonie, They a&s;&s;aulted, no per&s;ons, nor invaded any man: offe&s;&s;ions or goods, that they knew had bought their lands of them, &amp; covenanted with them, for them and made good their covenants.</P>
<P N="2">2. The Planters have taken the Indians goods from them by force when the Indians have come peaceably to trade with them.

The Planters have turned &s;ome of the Indians out of their places of abode and &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, after that the Indians have &s;ub|mitted to the Colonie, and to their Government, and have taken up their own lands after the cu&s;tome u&s;ed by the Colonie; As they did otherwi&s;e al&s;o very unchri&s;tianly requite the &s;er|vice which one of the Indian Kings did them in fighting again&s;t other Indians, that were pre&s;umed to be enemies to the Engli&s;h and to draw towards them to do them mi&s;chief.

<P N="4">4. The Planters have by their &s;everal and frequent acts of in|ju&s;tice and cruelty exerci&s;ed upon the Indians, in invading their rights and a&s;&s;aulting their per&s;ons, made the Indians in a man|ner to de&s;pair of ever living peaceably by them, or having any fair conver&s;e or commerce with them, as by their not &s;uffering the Indians to hunt in tho&s;e woods, or to fi&s;h in tho&s;e rivers, wherein they challenge a right, and are believed by divers &s;ober and di&s;creet men of the Colonie to have a right as well as them|&s;elves; as al&s;o by not permitting the Indians, though &s;ingle, or but two or three in a company, to approach neer to any of the habitations of the Engli&s;h (unle&s;s it be of &s;ome few of the bet|ter &s;ort and rank, who have more civility and humanity, and know better how to improve that advantage) And, if any of the Indians do chance to come into any of their Plantations, and are taken, the Engli&s;h oftentimesty them alive to trees and burn them to a&s;hes, or el&s;e otherwi&s;e murder them, without &s;hewing any cau&s;e, farther than the pretending that the Judians are not to be tru&s;ted, though (as I but now &s;aid) in their faithfulne&s;s and

<P N="1">1. The Planters, &s;ome of them, have not only dealt unju&s;tly and inhumanely with the poor heathen Indians; but to the far|ther di&s;honour of this Nation, and the greater &s;candal of our re|ligion profe&s;&s;ed by them, they did lately commit a mo&s;t hainous outrage, and bloody fact upon &s;ome of their own Engli&s;h Na|tion, that had &s;eated them&s;elves in <HI>Mary-land;</HI> &amp; that not upon a &s;uddain provoked boyling of their own blood, but, (&s;o far as circum&s;tances could demon&s;trate their intention) out of a Cain-like thir&s;ting after their brethrens blood, and a &s;ordid coveting of their e&s;tates; and what le&s;s can the Indians from thence infere, than, that if the Engli&s;h invade each others po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, and &s;hed each others bloods for them, &s;urely the poor contem|ned Indians cannot hope for either ju&s;tice or mercy from them; and therefore why &s;hould they &s;cruple the cutting of their throats or driving them out from among&s;t them, who &s;o little &s;cruple the cutting each others or any others throats, and the turning them out from cohabiting in the &s;ame country with them?</P>
<P N="2">2. The Planters (out of covetous de&s;ire to take up great Tracts of land) di&s;per&s;e them&s;elves very far from each other in the Country, and u&s;ually take up more land by an hundred parts, than they are able to manure or till, or make any u&s;e of: ren|dering them&s;elves thereby both u&s;ele&s;s to one another, &amp; the more un&s;erviceable to the publick; be&s;ides the expo&s;ing them&s;elves to be cut off the more ea&s;ily by the Indians, when they &s;hall take that occa&s;ion, which is too often given them, as well as under|&s;tand this advantage.</P>
<P N="3">3. The Planters ob&s;erve no ju&s;t order in taking up their pro|portions of land, but run up, one after another, all along by the rivers &s;ides; whereby they not onely prejudice others, that come after them, in their Planting and &s;eating them&s;elves; but do ve|ry much di&s;courage them from planting and &s;etling them&s;elves at all; becau&s;e they cannot have any tollerable convenience of the Rivers.</P>
<P N="4">4. The Planters doe generally regard the planting of no|thing but Tobacco; and that they plant &s;o exce&s;&s;ively, that they cannot (confidering their number of &s;ervants) make it up as it &s;hould be. And too many will not give it the dne making that they might; and do, for the mo&s;t of them, pack it &s;o fal&s;ly
<PB N="10" REF="16">and cheatingly; that the Traders thither, finding them&s;elves &s;o abu&s;ed &amp; cou&s;ened by them, and that, upon their complaining ther of no ju&s;tice is done them, (becau&s;e mo&s;t commonly the par|ties guilty are the judges) are very much di&s;heartned and di&s;|couraged from trading any longer with them. And if the Plan|ters them&s;elves do at any time bring, or &s;end over upon their own account, any con&s;iderable quantities thereof, it proves u|&s;ually &s;o bad, and of &s;o little worth, that all charges defrayed, they can &s;carce get more by it than their labour for their pains: whereas when &s;ome of them, that have been carefull to have their tobacco well made, and as well pact up, have brought over of the &s;ame, &s;ix hundred pounds have been offered to one of them for one yeares profit of his plantation.</P>
<P N="5">5.

<P N="6">6. The Planters in the generality, doe mo&s;t ba&s;ely cheat, and unju&s;tly deal with all that trade with them, in ca&s;e ei|ther them&s;elves, or any that come into tho&s;e parts to trade with them, happen to die there, or have any e&s;tates there when they die: For that all the e&s;tate that is found in the decea&s;ed's hands (be it who&s;e it will be) is appri&s;ed by certain appri&s;ers at half its worth: And the appri&s;ers for their paines take in a manner what they plea&s;e; and the re&s;t of the e&s;tate is put into the hands of any that claim any intere&s;t therein, under a pretence to keep it for the true proprietors; who &s;eldome get ought thereof, upon their demanding it, but are inforced, for the mo&s;t part, to &s;pend the full value thereof, and &s;ometimes if they will not bear that abu&s;e, twice as much as its value, before they can re|cover ought. And u&s;ually they lo&s;e both the principal e&s;tate, and all the charges expended for the regaining it. Which pra|ctice alone, if not &s;peedily remedied, will deterr all traders from adventuring thither, and de&s;troy all trade there, and &s;o ruine the Colonie.</P>
<P N="7">7. The Planters, many of them doe very much abu&s;e and op|pre&s;s their poor &s;ervants, by not allowing them that lodging

<P N="8">8. The Planters &s;uffer much, and complain excce&s;&s;ively of the heavy and unequal taxes laid upon them, which taxes in a great part are pretended to be impo&s;ed for the levying and rai|&s;ing of force to &s;ecure the Colony and defend them again&s;t their enemies; when as they are &s;pent and imbezled by the officers or large&s;&s;es of the a&s;&s;emblies of the Colony in intemperate drink|ing, and other riotous and luxurious practices, &s;o indu&s;try and temperance are di&s;couraged, and idlene&s;s and licentiou&s;ne&s;s are maintained, if not countenanced; which cannot but &s;oon overthrow the be&s;t of Plantations.</P>
<P N="9">9. The Planters do exceedingly mi&s;carry in not &s;etling head Townes in each County, that the people of that County, and all others that de&s;ire to trade with them, might be drawn to|gether, and manage their trading in &s;ome certain places; and not run up and down from hou&s;e to hou&s;e; e&s;pecially when the hou&s;es are at &s;o great a di&s;tance from each other, as there they are, and not above two hou&s;es together in any County except in <HI>James</HI> Town.</P>

<HEAD>The Injuries and over&s;ights chargeable upon the traders to <HI>Virginea</HI> are more di&s;cernably the&s;e.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. The Traders do very much Injurie to the Plantation in <HI>Vir|ginea</HI> by not victualing their &s;hips &s;ufficiently for the pa&s;&s;engers w^c^h they tran&s;port; in &s;o much that many of the pa&s;&s;engers are all mo&s;t fami&s;hed, before they reach thither, though the pa&s;&s;age be otherwi&s;e fair and within convenient time: and many dy &s;oon after they arrive there; which brings an ill report upon the Country, as though that killed them; when their death is to be attributed to their ill u&s;age and diet at &s;ea, ari&s;ing from the wretched covetou&s;ne&s;s of tho&s;e that &s;et forth &s;hips for the tran&s;|porting of pa&s;&s;engers, meerly for gain, and that gotten chiefly
<PB N="12" REF="17">by pinching and &s;tarving the carca&s;es of their poor pa&s;&s;engers.

Be|&s;ides, the &s;tarving of men de&s;igned for a place, where men are far more precious than they are here, and may, through Gods inabling them, prove much more &s;erviceable both to God and man than here they can be, aggravates that iniquity not a litle.</P>
<P N="2">2. Another wickedne&s;s, which &s;ome traders thither have pra|cti&s;ed upon their pa&s;&s;engers (&s;carce ever heard of before, much le&s;s practi&s;ed by any that call them &s;elves Chri&s;tians) is this, When a &s;torm or tempe&s;t hath happened at &s;ea in their pa&s;&s;age from hence thither, or they have otherwi&s;e mi&s;carried, through the default of the Ma&s;ter or Pilot of the &s;hip, &s;o that their pa&s;|&s;age hath been tedious and di&s;&s;icult; Some of tho&s;e Ma&s;ters have laid all the blame upon &s;ome of their pa&s;&s;engers; and not onely accu&s;ed them for witches, but executed &s;ome of them as witches, by their own authority, and without any legal trial and convi|ction. Now if heathen mariners in a de&s;perate death-threatning tempe&s;t at &s;ea, (after that they knew that it was ray &s;ed for one of their pa&s;&s;engers &s;akes, and was acknowledged &s;o to be by that pa&s;&s;enger him&s;elf, and were de&s;ired by him to ca&s;t him over|board, and promi&s;ed thereupon a ce&s;&s;ation of the &s;torm) were notwith&s;tanding both unwilling &amp; afraid to ca&s;t him over, left them&s;elves &s;hould lo&s;e their lives for ca&s;ting away his; or that his innocent blood might be otherwi&s;e required of them, and revenged on them, <HI>Jonah</HI> 1.

<P N="3">3. The Traders do very much abu&s;e and cheat tho&s;e of the Plantation, by impo&s;ing one &s;hilling <HI>per</HI> Hog&s;head upon all the Tobacco that comes from thence; and without the payment thereof, will not take their Goods aboord; which is done up|on the pretence of defraying the charge of de&s;troying the To|bacco planted in <HI>England.</HI> And this hath been practi&s;ed two or three years la&s;t pa&s;t; whereas they have not this la&s;t year de|&s;troyed the &s;aid Tobacco, nor &s;atisfied tho&s;e whom they for|merly imployed in that &s;ervice for &s;ome years before, but keep the Moneys &s;o rai&s;ed and collected by them, in their own hands, to a very con&s;iderable &s;um.

<P N="4">4. There is one thing more, that is found by experience to have hindred the Engli&s;h Colony in <HI>Virginea</HI> very much in re|&s;pect of the Traders thither; which your humble Remon&s;trant is very tender of mentioning, becau&s;e it reflects too much upon a late revived Law of this Nation; and therefore it &s;hall be only propounded to your Highne&s;s better con&s;ideration, to examine and judge, whether the Planters in <HI>Virginea</HI> do &s;uffer more thereby, or the Merchants of <HI>England</HI> gain more: and &s;o whe|ther it be not more for our Nations honour and profit to conti|nue it, than it would be for that Plantations advantage to take it off. Or whether there may not be &s;ome expedient found out for the ea&s;ing of that Plantation in particular, without open|ing a door to a wor&s;e grievance or inconvenience to this whole Nation in general. The thing complained of by the Planters, is the prohibiting of Foreigners to trade thither. By which pro|hibition &s;a they). the Engli&s;h Traders thither will have the
<PB N="14" REF="18">Tobaco at their own rates, and &s;ell their own goods and com|modities tran&s;ported thither at their own prices in&s;omuch that whereas, when the Dutch traded thither, the Planters bought &s;hoos at 12. <HI>l.</HI> of Tobacco; &s;ince they were prohibited, the En|gli&s;h made them to pay 50. <HI>l.</HI> of Tobacco for the like: and &s;o in proportion for other commodities. And then, if any of the Plantation &s;ent Tobacco hither, they had the fraight thereof for 4. <HI>l. per</HI> Tun, but upon the prohibition of the Dutch they &s;ometimes paid 14. <HI>l. per</HI> Tun, and mo&s;t con&s;tantly 8. <HI>l.</HI> or 9. <HI>l. per</HI> Tun. And whereas the Dutch would then give the Planters 3. <HI>d.</HI> per pound for their Tobacco, and give good bills of Ex|change for it, (which Tobacco would yield them 6 <HI>d.</HI> and 7. <HI>d. per</HI> pound; and &s;o the Merchant was inabled to pay fraight, ex|ci&s;e, and cu&s;tomes, and get tollerable gaines) &s;ince that, the Tobacco, for the mo&s;t part of it, will not yield above an half penny <HI>per</HI> pound there; and when it comes to England, it will &s;carce pay the fraight and cu&s;tome, by rea&s;on of the want of that vent which it formerly had, before the Dutch planted Tobacco in their own territories; which they did not till that prohibi|tion. So that by this means (&s;ay the Planters) the Plantation is in a manner ruined, at lea&s;t &s;oon will be, if there be not a prudent and timely prevention thereof, as your Highne&s;s al&s;o &s;uffers al&s;o not a little in your cu&s;tomes and exci&s;e, and the tra|ders them&s;elves by their trading. The redre&s;&s;ing of all which, if po&s;&s;ible, without wor&s;e prejudice to That Plantation or this Nation, is a worke worth the undertaking and skill of the be&s;t and mo&s;t prudent of both Nations, and the &s;ole aim of your Re|mon&s;trants pre&s;enting it to your Highne&s;s.</P>

<HEAD>IV. The great neglect of Gods ordinances, wor&s;hip, and &s;er|vice throughout the whole Plantation may be a&s;cribed to the&s;e original and &s;ome far other additional cau&s;es.</HEAD>

<P N="2">2. There are not a few of the Mini&s;ters, who&s;e wicked and prophane lives cau&s;e the wor&s;hip and &s;ervice of God, not only to be &s;lighted, but to be little le&s;s than abhorred, when they of|ficiate therein; As there are al&s;o divers, who&s;e in&s;ufficiency and inability to &s;top the mouthes of gain-&s;ayers, occa&s;ion too many of the people of all &s;orts to open wide their rude, prophane, bla&s;|phemous mouthes both again&s;t them&s;elves and all others of their holy function; as al&s;o again&s;t their very office it &s;elfe, and tho&s;e holy Ordinances about which it is conver&s;ant. And thus (as the prophet <HI>Jeremie</HI> &s;ometimes complained <HI>cap:</HI> 23.) <HI>From the Pro|phets&mdash;is prophane&s;s gone forth into all the Land.</HI> And the true original cau&s;es of both the&s;e mi&s;cariages in tho&s;e Mini&s;ters is this, The greate&s;t part of them are &s;uch as went over thither not out of any de&s;igne or de&s;ire to do God and that Plantation, much le&s;s the poor heathen thereto adjoyning any &s;ervice by their Mini&s;tery; but out of &s;ome by aimes and ends of their own, being indeed &s;uch, as were a&s;hamed, or affraid, to live any long|er here in this Nation; or at the lea&s;t &s;uch as &s;ought only to get &s;omething for them&s;elves, having little hopes in the&s;e daies e&s;pe|cially, from the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of their own unworthine&s;s, to procure any preferment or tollerable &s;ub&s;i&s;tence here: and ac|cordingly they now live and practice there.</P>
<P N="3">3. Tho&s;e Mini&s;ters, That are religious and laborious, &s;uch as are worthy of double honour, both becau&s;e of their labouring in the word and doctrine, as al&s;o becau&s;e of their being true &s;hining lights before the people in their holy exemplarie lives and conver&s;ations, have &s;carce that &s;ingle honour paid them that they de&s;erve, from the mo&s;t; and are di&s;honoured and de&s;pi&s;ed by too many.

<P>When the Engli&s;h complained to one of the neighbouring Indian Kings, that &s;ome of his Indians had taken away &s;ome of their Hoggs; He a&s;&s;ured them, that it was contrarie to his will and command; but they might well forbear the aggravating that fact &s;o much as they did; for that many of the Engli&s;h had oftentimes killed and carried away divers of his Deer.

<P>At another time there were twelve of the Indians murthered by the Engli&s;h. For which bloody fact, the King of tho&s;e In|dians

<NOTE PLACE="marg">Roanoke and wam|pampege are a kind of beads current a|mong&s;t the Indi|ans for money, and is as their &s;il|ver and gold.</NOTE> that ju&s;tice might be executed up|on the per&s;ons that were guilty.

The Indian king told them, that he expected &s;uch ju&s;tice to be done and &s;uch pu|ni&s;hment to be inflicted upon tho&s;e murderers, as the Engli&s;h u&s;ed to inflict upon the like among&s;t them&s;elves. But &s;eeing that would not be granted; he required that then according to the Indian cu&s;tome, &s;o many in number of the Engli&s;h, as there were Indians &s;lain, &s;hould bring that Roanoke and Wampam|page and tender it to him: which when they did, The Indian King, to fright them into a deeper &s;en&s;e of that their inju&s;tice, told them, that he would now &s;lay eleven of them, and &s;end back again by the twelfth, &s;o much Roanoke and Wampampege proportionably as they had &s;ent for the like number, that they had &s;lain.</P>
<P>Another time, there were three Indians (whereof two were of great power and honour among&s;t them) that were accu&s;ed for attempting to poy&s;on the Governour of the Engli&s;h or otherwi&s;e to a&s;&s;a&s;ine him, And the Governour, upon the di&s;covery thereof required of their King, that their three heads, which were in that con&s;piracy, &s;hould be forthwith &s;ent unto him, for the expiating that high offence; or el&s;e he and his people would re|venge it upon the &s;aid King and his people. The King being unwilling, if not affraid, by rea&s;on of the power, and as &s;ome &s;ay alliance of two of them, to execute ju&s;tice in that rigour upon them all; cut of the head of one of the three, and &s;ent it to the Engli&s;h Governour by the other two. The Governour being not &s;atisfied therewith, &s;ent tho&s;e two with other me&s;&s;engers to their King to know the rea&s;on, why he &s;ent him but one of tho&s;e heads, when he required all three. To which the King returned this an&s;wer. That he had &s;ent all the three heads, that the Governour demanded to be &s;ent; And if the Governour were plea&s;ed to return two of them back again, it was to be a|&s;cribed to his goodne&s;s and mercy and not to be imputed to any failing in him who had performed what was required.</P>
<P>There is one &s;tory more, which I may not omit, becau&s;e it
<PB N="25" REF="23">&s;avours not onely of wit but of more true Wi&s;dom and Religi|on, than is u&s;ually found in multitudes that call them&s;elves Chri&s;tians; and that is this. When &s;ome of the Engli&s;h were imployed about building an hou&s;e, and &s;ome other work, for an Indian King, he being by covenant to provide victuals for them, did accordingly con&s;tantly provide for them, what was nece&s;&s;ary, the whole &s;ix daies of the week through; but when the Lords day came, and he &s;aw the Engli&s;h forbear to work, and falling to &s;porting and playing, he commanded that no victuals &s;hould be allowed them: which when the Engli&s;h com|plained of, they had this an&s;wer returned them; That the King would allow them no victuals on that day, becau&s;e on that day they did him no work. To which, when the Engli&s;h re|plyed; That that day was a day &s;et a part to &s;erve God in, and not a day to labour, or work in; It was told them again from the King; That if he did &s;ee them &s;erve God on that day, they &s;hould have what is nece&s;&s;ary allowed them; but he was &s;ure that they could not &s;erve God by &s;porting and playing.</P>

The Woods, which are very va&s;t, abound with Deer, and o|ther bea&s;ts, who&s;e carca&s;es, or skins, or both, are very u&s;efull and profitable. The Rivers are infinitely &s;tored with all &s;orts of excellent Fi&s;h, and water-Fowls; as the dry Land is with other fowls. The bowels of the earth are fraught with admirable Mines of Iron, Lead, Copper, and (as &s;ome &s;ay) Silver: And for the upper parts thereof, be&s;ides what it &s;ends forth natural|ly, which is much variety of delightfull and u&s;efull commodi|ties, It would, with a little labour and indu&s;try in planting, and keeping it, be made extraordinary rich in the production of Silk, Wine, Currants, Ra&s;ins, Flaxe, and almo&s;t any thing that any other Country yields. O that it might but once bear (as tis &s;aid of <HI>Canaan, Wi&s;dom</HI> 12.7.) a worthy Colony of Gods children; And then <HI>Canaan</HI> it &s;elf could &s;carce ever have been &s;aid to have excelled it. Which that it may do, &s;hall be the earne&s;t and ince&s;&s;ant prayer of him, who daily prays that the Lord would incline, and move your Highne&s;s heart to contri|bute your be&s;t a&s;&s;i&s;tance to this great work, tending &s;o much to the glory of God, the propagation of the Go&s;pel, the good and comfort of many thou&s;ands of &s;ouls in that va&s;t Continent, this Nations honour, and your Highne&s;s highe&s;t renown.</P>
