<OPENER><SALUTE>Right Honorable,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_THough no Tongue or Pen be able to expre&s;s the greatne&s;s of the ac|tion, &s;uitable to that magnificent appearance of God, in the behalf of poor England; yet becau&s;e it is a main part of our duty, in any mea&s;ure, to become
<PB N="4" REF="3">&s;ub&s;ervient to his glory, it is conceived no|thing can more advance it, then by recount|ing before all the world, the many wonde|rous and mighty di&s;pen&s;ations of his mer|cy.</P>
<P>For upon the 30 and 31 of Octob. the waves at &s;ea roul'd high and tempe&s;tuous; for the windes were at a &s;ad conte&s;t of Ma|&s;ter&s;hip for 48 hours together, &s;o that our Navy were nece&s;&s;itated to draw neer the Harbours; however the very &s;torms provd advantagious to us; for a Squadron of the enemies &s;hips pa&s;&s;ing by the I&s;le of Wight, were by the force of the tempe&s;t &s;cattered and divided, and in that di&s;order 4 of them were driven in upon Gen. Blake, who wil|ling to entertain all the &s;miles of fortune, mo&s;t courteou&s;ly embraced their inevitable reducement, and has &s;ent them all prizes in|to the Downs. Two Merchant men &s;ince
<PB N="5" REF="3">laden with wines and other rich commodi|ties, partaking of the &s;ame di&s;a&s;ter in wea|ther, are taken in like manner, and now on &s;ail towards Dover for Winter-quarters, 7 &s;hips more pretending them&s;elves Ham|burgers, were likewi&s;e taken by the States Frigots, and conveyed to Plymouth, where they are at pre&s;ent, till &s;uch time that they can make it appear that they are not Fle|mins, otherwi&s;e to expect to be made pri|zes. Three more likewi&s;e upon the Coa&s;t of France were brought in by the Pelican to the fleet, under the &s;ame pretence of Ham|burgers; but unle&s;s they prove it &s;uddenly, and by &s;ufficient demon&s;tration, they mu&s;t look for an inimical Cen&s;ure. Yet that which doth mo&s;t illu&s;trate the &s;plendour of our Victory, is, the di&s;&s;ipating of the Dutch Convoy, with 100 &s;ail of Merchants, neer the I&s;les of Orkney, by Cap. Ball, with 20 Men of War.</P>

<P>General Blake maintains the We&s;tern &s;eas, and expects the coming forth of the Dutch Fleet very &s;uddenly. Vantrump hath tendered an Oath to all his Officers and Sea-men; and unanimou&s;ly they have vow'd to di&s;pute their Quarrel upon the Ne|ptu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">e Ocean to the la&s;t man. But it is the Muzzle of the Canon, and not &s;uch Squibs mu&s;t re&s;olve our Ca&s;e.</P>
<P>Two hundred &s;ail of Colliers are now bound from Newca&s;tle for London; they put forth on the third of November, and are daily expected at the Hope.</P>
<P>On Munday being the eighth of this in&s;ta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">t, we received intelligence, That Sir George Carteret is very bu&s;ie with his Pickeroons upon the We&s;tern Coa&s;t, &s;eizing divers &s;mall Ve&s;&s;els, but &s;ometimes they &s;nap &s;hort of their prey; and in&s;tead of prize receive &s;hipwrack. Among&s;t the re&s;t, a gallant &s;hip richly laden with plunder'd Plate, and other famous Commodities, was bulg'd upon the Sands neer Co|rum in Kent, and became a prey to the Inhabitants thereabouts: &s;he is by e&s;timation deemed to be worth forty thou&s;and pounds.</P>
<P>Great are the preparations for War throughout all the Provinces; but the mo&s;t active and forward
<PB N="7" REF="4">to engage are the Engli&s;h: Yet there is a people who are loath to run the hazard of War, knowing that it is not a little Ghelt mu&s;t feed the flame, and want of Trade will &s;oon make a hole in the bottom of their pur&s;es. And &s;o I leave them between Hope and De&s;pair: God knows the future Events, and not I.</P>
<P>Yet notwith&s;tanding, the E&s;tates now pro&s;ecute their De&s;ign with great vigor, and have paid the Sea-men off all their arrears, &s;o that there is a gene|ral concurrence of their Mariners to be in action once more; and their whole Navy are now ready to launch forth. The Lords have mu&s;tered 30000 able and expert men of Armes, out of which 5000 were &s;elected to man the Navy. The intere&s;t of the King of Scots is eagerly pro&s;ecuted among&s;t them; and all the talk is, of his Cau&s;e, and Advance, to pal|liate their new De&s;ign The King of Denmark hath &s;ent a Declaration to the E&s;tates General, a&s;&s;uring them of his readine&s;s to joyn with them, for the ad|vancing of the King of Scots intere&s;t, provided they would play the like Game; which they &s;eem very forward in, to run an apparent hazard of the fortune of their own Commonwealth to hold the conte&s;ta|tion with ours. Thirty men of War are coming
<PB N="8" REF="5">from the Baltick &s;eas to joyn with them; from whence we hear, that the King hath &s;ent a &s;ummons throughout all his Dominions, in obedience where|unto, there hath been a great mu&s;tering of the Mi|litia, and a great Army is drawn down towards the Sound; &s;o that there &s;eems to be a mighty compli|ance of both &s;ides in heightning their war and con|&s;piracy again&s;t us. We hear that his Maj. of Den|mark hath &s;ent the King of Scots one hundred thou|&s;and pounds for a Pre&s;ent, with the promi&s;ed a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance of Him and His Subjects, in the di&s;puting of His Cau&s;e again&s;t all Oppo&s;ers.</P>
<P>In pur&s;uance whereof, He hath broke open the Engli&s;h &s;hips by him detained in the Sound, and is re&s;olved to pro&s;ecute the Quarrel, which gives a &s;e|cond occa&s;ion of joy to the Hollanders, in regard they &s;uppo&s;e it is an engagement upon him to &s;tand to his affront: But there is a Judge above, that mu&s;t cen&s;ure the&s;e actions, beyond whom there is no appeal, and in whom, no perverting of Judg|ment.</P>
