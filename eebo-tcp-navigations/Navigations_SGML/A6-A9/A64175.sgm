<LG>
<L>And now a short discourse of travelling</L>
<L>Of Travellers, and of my wandering:</L>
<L>The Sun's a Traveller (and a great one too)</L>
<L>In twice twelve houres, he round the World doth goe;</L>
<L>The Moone surrounds us in her changing spheare,</L>
<L>Three hundred sixty and five times a yeare.</L>
<L>But yet the thoughts of man more quick doth run</L>
<L>Then flashing lightning, or the Moone or Sun.</L>
<L>My restlesse thoughts can in a moment leape</L>
<L>To Heaven, and thence to the infernall deepe.</L>
<L>To <HI>Europe, Asia,</HI> and <HI>America,</HI></L>
<L>To the orient <HI>Indies,</HI> to hot <HI>Africa;</HI></L>
<L>The Summer, Autumne, Winter, and the Spring</L>
<L>Are in perpetuall motion, travelling.</L>
<L>And though my thoughts (like other men's are vaine,</L>
<L>Winds, Seas, nor Stormes, my thinking can restraine.</L>
<L>At Travellers, let no man carpe or cavill,</L>
<L>Our Mothers (at our births) were all in travell.</L>
<L>And from our birth unto our buriall,</L>
<L>In divers Functions we do travell All.</L>
<L>The Footman's feet, the Statesman's working braine,</L>
<L>In travell, labour, and continuall paine</L>
<L><PB N="9" REF="5">Do spend themselves, and all their courses bend</L>
<L>For private ends (to no end) till they end.</L>
<L>The Lawyer travells, his tongue (swift with sleight)</L>
<L>Sells his words deare, by measure, tale, and weight:</L>
<L>And those that buy them deare, do often find</L>
<L>They paid well for good words, but words are winde.</L>
<L>All men are born to travell, each man must</L>
<L>With paine and travell, turn unto his dust:</L>
<L>Then happy is the man that can go right,</L>
<L>Who doth his paths with <HI>Davids</HI> Lanthorne light.</L>
<L>And all my life time it hath been my fate</L>
<L>To be a traveller legitimate:</L>
<L>From head to heele, by either Land or Sea</L>
<L>I am a Traveller, Right <HI>Cape a Pe<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="overwritten" EXTENT="1 letter">.</HI></L>

<L>Now <HI>Atropos</HI> is ready with her Knife</L>
<L>To cut the uncertaine feeble twist of life;</L>
<L>Now in my Autumne, or my fall o'th leafe</L>
<L>Halfe dead, halfe living, halfe blinde, lame, halfe deafe,</L>
<L>Now all these five halves can not make one whole</L>
<L>(From m' head unto my body bearing sole)</L>
<L>Now at this time, with brains, and feet, and pen,</L>
<L>I am an old new Traveller agen.</L>
<L>'Tis not the greatnes of <HI>Golias</HI> can</L>
<L>Perswade me to be lesser then a man:</L>

<L>Nor would I have the Reader to mistake,</L>
<L>That odious bold comparisons I make:</L>
<L>Pamphlets must not compare with Reverend Writings</L>

<L>Transcending mine, as <HI>Titan</HI> doth a Starre;</L>

<P><HI>Norwich,</HI> is a famous ancient City, built many yeares before the Norman Conquest; it had a strong Castle in it double ditched, out of the ruins or corruption of the Castle, a Jayle (or Goale) was engendred, to which use it is now put: It was spoy|led by <HI>Hugh Bigot</HI> Earl of <HI>Norfolk,</HI> in the raign of K, <HI>Henry</HI> the second, and a greater mischief befell the
<PB N="17" REF="9">
City in King <HI>Henry</HI> the thirds time, for the Citi|zens (in a tumultuous fury) spoyled it with fire, and withal burnt the goodly Priory Church, which afterwards they were caused to rebuild in a fairer manner. Lastly, <HI>Norwich</HI> was won and fired by <HI>Ket</HI> and his Army of Rebels, since when it hath been well repaired, and in a flourishing condition; the wals of the City are of more circuit or bounds then the wals of <HI>London:</HI> But it is to be considered, there are Pasture Grounds, Gardens, and waste Lands (not built upon) more then half the ground within the walls; it hath 12. gates to issue in and out 12. severall wayes, whereby it may be concei|ved that it is large in circuit, (for <HI>London</HI> hath not fo many) there are 30. faire Parish Churches, there were five more, but they are ruined besore these present troubles; the goodly Cathedrall is much defaced in these late times of Reformation. It was governed by 2 <HI>Bayliffs,</HI> till King <HI>Edward</HI> the fourth impowred them to chuse a Mayor, and gave Pri|viledges to them, and Charters of honorable and memorable regard: The Low <HI>Dutch</HI> (or <HI>Nether|land</HI> Nation) being frighted from their Country by the cruelty of the Duke <HI>D' Alva,</HI> who was Livete|nant Governour there under the King of <HI>Spaine,</HI> (who for his Tyranny the people called Duke <HI>Dia|bota</HI>) they fled in multitudes into <HI>England,</HI> and thou|sands

<L>I grieve to see the Churches there demollish'd,</L>
<L>Sects plenty, and true Piety abollish'd.</L>
</LG>
<P>This Town of <HI>Repham</HI> (or <HI>Reepham</HI>) hath three faire Churches, were standing in one Church-yard, it is sayd they were built by three Sisters; one of them hath beene long decayed and fallen to the ground, onely the Tower stands faire and strong; the other two Churches do serve four Parishes,
<PB N="20" REF="11" MS="y">
and I could hear no more but three Bels on Sunday there: So that the reckoning is one Church-yard, three Bels, two Chreches, three Steeples, foure Parishes, and one broken Church for Lumber.</P>
<P>The second of <HI>September</HI> (being Monday) I left <HI>Reepham,</HI> and travelled 18. miles to a Village called <HI>Gayton;</HI> but by the way (at a place called <HI>Brissley</HI>) I was told of a Holy Sister, who by falling back, had risen forward, to the increase of the faithfull: she being reproved falling and rising, sayd it was pure zeale that pricked her on, and that it was done with a Brother, he and she, and every one being bound to do for, and with one another, and I hear|ing of her kindnesse bestowed this short Epigram on her.</P>
<LG>
<L>Hath Lust defil'd her purenesse, never match'd?</L>
<L>No 'twas deceit, she hath been cunny-catch'd:</L>
<L>It was a rule, she learned of her Mother,</L>
<L>That 'twas no sin to couple with a Brother.</L>
</LG>
<P>But to return again where I left: at <HI>Gayton</HI> there are 2 playn Ale-houses, and one Wine Ale-house; these houses were distant one from the other a fur|long, or two flight shoot: at the first house (where the Wine was) there were fellows swaggering, and ready to draw their fists, there I would not lodge; at the second I would have lodged, but could not, their beds were all taken up; at the third the doors
<PB N="21" REF="11" MS="y">
were lock'd &amp; the windows shut, no body at home, the folkes not come home from Harvest worke; forward I knew not whether, and backward I would not goe, and to stand still there was cold comfort for an old weary Traveller, there being no harbour, but a wild Common, nor any company to passe the time withall but 3 or 4 flocks of Geese; in this extremity I espy'd an old-old, very old, neat handed little antient man, to him I went, and told him that I would have lodged at that house, but it was shut up; quoth he the folkes will come home by and by, but I doe not know whether they have any lodging or no, and sure me think you be a clean man, and tis pitty you should lye on the Common, if you will goe home and lye with me, I am an old Widdower, and one bed shall hold us both.</P>
<P>I thankfully embraced his courteous offer, and went with him, where I sup'd and log'd well, and would take nothing of me; his name is <HI>Sampson Warrington,</HI> in remembrance of whose kindnes I have written this thankfull expession.</P>
<P>I was told there of a precise holy ma~ in those parts, who sent his man unto a Pasture ground to see his horse, the fellow went, and brought word to his Master that his horse was <HI>Dead,</HI> dead quoth hee, how dar'st thou tell me my horse is dead? the fel|low answered, I pray you be not angry, sure I am
<PB N="22" REF="12" MS="y">
that if he be not dead, that he is either deceased, or changed his life; well sayd the Master, if my horse be departed, I have lost a good one, <HI>for he was so sure of his feet, that I would have put my life into his hands.</HI></P>
<P>Tuesday September 3. I went 4 miles to a Village called <HI>North-Wooton,</HI> 3 miles from <HI>Linn,</HI> there I was much beholding to my Kinsman Mr. <HI>John Clark,</HI> he gave me large and free welcome, for which to him with his good Wife, my gratitude is manifested; also my thankes to Mr. <HI>Swift.</HI></P>
<P>Wednesday I went to <HI>Linn,</HI> where a good old Joviall Lad named <HI>John Scarborow</HI> entertained mee sumptuously (for my Cozen <HI>John Clarks</HI> sake) and also he was somewhat the kinder to me, because he had often heard of me, besides of his own dispo|<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="missing" EXTENT="1 letter">ition is free from discourtesie to strangers, I thank him for my fresh fish, my Duck, or Mallard, my lodging, Ale, and Oysters, with the appurtenances. &amp;c.</P>
<P><HI>Linn</HI> was much honoured by King <HI>John</HI> for their Loyalty, for which that King gave them his owne word, and a faire gilt Bole, which they keep as honorable memorialls to this day: it is a faire large stronge Sea Towne, it is now a Garison, the River hat the Sea doth flow thereinto, disperseth it self into many Branches, for the commodious enrich|ing
<PB N="23" REF="12" MS="y">
of divers Shires, Counties, Townes, and Places, as <HI>Rutlandshire, Huntingdonshire, Cambridge,</HI> and <HI>Cambridgeshire,</HI> the Isle of <HI>Ely,</HI> &amp;c. those Rivers doe carry and re-carry all maner of goods and Merchan|dise, so that <HI>Linn</HI> with all those Countreys are fur|nished with more Sea-coales then doe come up the River of <HI>Thames,</HI> wood being so scarce that the Rich might blow their nailes, and the poore would bee starved in the Winter for want of fiting in all those Counties, if the Rivers were not.</P>
<P>. . .Thursday the 5. of September I left <HI>Linn,</HI> and tooke an open passage Boat, being bedewed all day and night, and almost all the Fryday with raine without ceasing, so that, on Fryday I came to <HI>Cambridge</HI> sufficiently pickled: there I tooke up my lodging at the signe of the Rose (one of the best Innes) where I thank Mr. <HI>Brian</HI> and his Wife (my old acquaintance) I had good cheere and lodging <HI>gratis</HI> and welcome; I tooke notice of the Colled|ges, they stand as fair and stately as ever, and (for any thing that I know) there may be as much lear|ning as ever was, but I saw but few Schollars or Gowne men.</P>
<P>On Saturday the 7. of September, I was determi|ned to see <HI>Sturbridge</HI> Faire, but by fortune I espyed an empty Cart returning towards London 17 miles to a Towne call'd <HI>Baldock;</HI> by which means I left
<PB N="24" REF="13" MS="y">
<HI>Cambridge</HI> without taking my leave of Mr. <HI>Brian,</HI> for which I crave his and his Wive's pardon.</P>
<P>That day I was uncarted at <HI>Baldock,</HI> and footed it 7 miles more to <HI>Steevenedge,</HI> there (at the Faulcon) I stayd Saturday and Sunday, and on Monday I tra|velled to <HI>Hatfield,</HI> and to <HI>Barnet</HI> 17 miles, wher I was discreetly wet and dirty, and took up my lodging at the Bell with a silent Clapper. The next day (being Tuesday) I came home to my house wet and weary in Phoenix Alley, at the signe of the Crowne, near the Globe Taverne, about the middle of Long-A|cre or Covent Garden.</P>
<LG>
<L>Thus having touch'd no State, or State Affaires,</L>
<L>Or mentioned men that sit in Honours Chaires:</L>
<L>I dare declare him of a base condition,</L>
<L>That of my Lines or Travels hath suspition.</L>
<L>I formerly have falsely been accus'd,</L>
<L>And therefore now I hope to be excus'd.</L>
<L>This time I travell'd (for my life's preserving)</L>
<L>To get some money, to prevent a starving:</L>
<L>And every one that for my Booke doth pay me,</L>
<L>Doth love me, lodge me, feed me, and aray me.</L>
<L>With feet and pen, my walke and worke is done,</L>
<L>And (<HI>Caesar</HI> like) the Conquest I have won:</L>
<L>And though I never shall have Caesars Fame,</L>
<L>Tet I did see, I came, and overcame.</L>
