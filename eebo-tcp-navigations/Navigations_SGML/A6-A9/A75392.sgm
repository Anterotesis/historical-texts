<HEAD>The An&s;wer of the Officers of the Army in Scotland, to the lato Letter &s;ent from the Lord Gen. Cromwel, and the Coun|cel of the Army in England, concerning the chu&s;ing of a new Parliament.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear and precious friends,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOurs of the 28 of Jan. came to our hands, and was with abundance of joy and gladne&s;s received by us, and we hope that it will in a great mea&s;ure &s;tirre up our hearts, and a waken us out of that dead and drow&s;ie condi|tion which along time we have lain in; and we do ble&s;&s;e the name of the Lord on your behalfes, who have put us in remembrance of the&s;e things: for &s;urely we have been altogether deficient in our &s;uitable returnes to the mo&s;t High for the&s;e extraordinary mercies, and unexpected fa|vours, which not onely our &s;elves, but all the Lords peo|ple in the&s;e Nations have been &s;harers in; And indeed we are very &s;en&s;ible how far we have neglected our duty each to others, in that we have not endeavoured the &s;trength|ning of our, hearts and hands each of other by renewing the remembrance of the great things of our God upon all occa&s;ions one to another, but have rather had our hearts and hands imployed in &s;uch things as will not at all ad|vantage us at the appearing of our Lord; &s;o that we mu&s;t needs &s;ay, that we have every one of us &s;ought his owne, but not others good; neither have we endeavoured in our &s;everal places the an&s;wering of that great de&s;ign of God, which &s;urely he will have brought about, which is to lo&s;e the bands of wickedne&s;s, to undo the heavy burdens, and to let the oppre&s;&s;ed go free; then &s;hould the light have brake forth as the morning, and the righteou&s;ne&s;s &s;hall go before, and the glory of the Lord &s;hal be our reward, <HI>I&s;ai.</HI> 28. The&s;e things being &s;en&s;ibly &s;et upon our hearts, we
<PB N="8" REF="5">could not but acquaint you; and through grace we do &amp; &s;hall re&s;olve, every one of us in our places, to make it our work to &s;eek the face of the Lord, both together &amp; apart: And we are not out of hopes but that the Lord will be found of us, and manife&s;t him&s;elf in us, and by us. We are indeed at a great di&s;tance from the re&s;t of our relations in the re&s;pective Regiments to whom we belong, here being in a corner of the countrey but a &s;mall part of Maj. Gen. Col. <HI>Lilburns,</HI> and Col. <HI>Morgans</HI> Regiments. However, we hope that you will have the like return from all the re&s;t that belong to us, upon occa&s;ion; and we &s;hall not (God willing) come in the lea&s;t &s;hort of our duty toward them, in putting them in minde of their duty towards the Lord, and towards each other, that &s;o they may not draw away their &s;houlders, but be up and doing every one in their place, in carrying forward the great Work of the mo&s;t High, which &s;urely he will have brought about.</P>
<P>We &s;hall not trouble you any further at pre&s;ent; onely to tell you, that we will not cea&s;e importuning at the Throne of grace for you, that the Lord will &s;trengthen your hearts and hands in this great bu&s;ine&s;s, our hearts be|ing with you, and our de&s;ires and affections towards you, we &s;hall commend you to the grace of the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and remain</P>
