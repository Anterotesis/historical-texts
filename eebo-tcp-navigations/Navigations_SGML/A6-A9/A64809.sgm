<HEAD>THE PUBLISHER TO THE READER.</HEAD>
<P>_THere are many, who having read <HI>Plato</HI>'s Commonwealth, Sir <HI>Thomas More</HI>'s <HI>&V;topia,</HI> the Lord <HI>Verulam</HI>'s <HI>New Atlantis,</HI> (which are but Ideas and ingenious fancies) are apt to &s;u&s;pect all relatons of new di&s;cove|ries to be of that kind; and chiefly when they find in them any thing extraordinary and wonderful. But although the&s;e per&s;ons are to be commended for being wary and cautious, yet it is but &s;o long as they keep within the bounds of mo|deration,
<PB REF="3">
and do not pa&s;s to the exce&s;s of incredulity. For as &s;ome men, through a believing &s;implici|ty, are ea&s;ily impo&s;ed upon, and receive that for a truth, which in effect is not one: So others, on the contrary, through a contrary hu|mour, are apt to reject, as fabulous, that which often proves to be a real truth. This clearly appears in the ca&s;e of <HI>Vergilius</HI> Bi&s;hop of <HI>Collen,</HI> who was like to have &s;uffered a &s;evere puni&s;hment for affirming, that <HI>There were Antipodes;</HI> neither could any thing &s;ave him but a publick Re|cantation. <HI>Columbus</HI> was looked up|on (here in <HI>England,</HI> and afterward in <HI>France)</HI> as a brain-&s;ick Fellow for &s;aying, <HI>There was Land on the We&s;t parts of the Ocean:</HI> Yet the Voyages &s;ince made round the World have ju&s;tified <HI>Vergilius</HI> his opinion: And the di&s;covery of <HI>America</HI> (where we have many flouri&s;hing Plantations)
<PB REF="3">
has &s;ufficiently evidenced the truth of <HI>Columbus</HI> his A&s;&s;ertion. The Hi&s;tories of <HI>Peru, Mexico, China,</HI> &amp;c. were at fir&s;t taken for Romances by many, but time has &s;hewed &s;ince that they are verities not to be doubted of.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e remote Countries were for thou&s;ands of years unknown to the People of <HI>Europe,</HI> and &s;o are &s;till many others perhaps, and at this day we know little more of them, than what lies upon the Sea-coa&s;ts. But how &s;hould we have a perfect knowledge of remote Countries, lately di&s;covered, &s;ince there are many parts of <HI>Europe</HI> very little known yet, and &s;ome not at all? Nay, the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> I&s;lands are not per|fectly de&s;cribed: And before their la&s;t Civil Wars, the <HI>Highlands</HI> of <HI>Scotland;</HI> many parts of <HI>Ireland,</HI> and other &s;maller I&s;les about, were very little known to the People of <HI>Eng|land:</HI>
<PB REF="4">
And their Cu&s;toms, Laws, and Religion, are things we have not yet had any very good account of. Few Travellers make it their bu&s;i|ne&s;s to write Hi&s;tories, and make de&s;criptions of tho&s;e Countries they have travelled in, for mo&s;t of them being Merchants, or Sea|men, they mind little more than their Trade; and being intent up|on gain and profit, &s;eldom bu&s;ie them&s;elves in making ob&s;ervations. Be&s;ides, few of them are qualified for the writing of Books if they were never &s;o willing; and fewer have time and opportunity to apply them&s;elves to that &s;tudy; &s;o it falls out, that we have few exact relati|ons of remote Countries, although they be often &s;een, and even de|&s;cribed in Maps. For an In&s;tance, The I&s;le of <HI>Borneo</HI> lies near <HI>Java,</HI> and in the way to <HI>China,</HI> it is one of the bigge&s;t in the world according to
<PB REF="4">
Geographical De&s;criptions, and yet we have very little knowledge of it, although the <HI>Dutch</HI> have very large Dominions in <HI>Java,</HI> and other I&s;lands about it, and &s;ail daily by it in their way to <HI>Jappan</HI> and <HI>China.</HI> Many other places there are which Sailers take no more notice of than as it is nece&s;&s;ary for their Ships to avoid them. And how can it be ex|pected we &s;hould have any good de|&s;criptions of them, unle&s;s &s;ome great Powers &s;hould undertake it, and &s;end fit per&s;ons for that purpo&s;e, with all the helps and encourage|ment requi&s;ite in &s;o u&s;eful and ho|nourable a de&s;ign? Among all re|mote Countries, there is none &s;o va&s;t, and &s;o little known, as the third Continent, commonly called, <HI>Terra Au&s;tralis.</HI> It is true, Geogra|phers give &s;ome &s;mall and unperfect de&s;criptions of it, but it is with little knowledge and certainty; and
<PB REF="5">
mo&s;t of their draughts may be &s;u|&s;pected, and look'd upon, as ima|ginary and fictitious. Sure it is, that there is &s;uch a Continent; many have &s;een it, and even landed there, but few dur&s;t venture far in it, if any there were; and I do not think that any body hath made any true de&s;cription of it, either for want of knowledge, or other nece&s;&s;ary means and opportunities.</P>
<P>This Hi&s;tory will &s;upply that de|fect, in a great mea&s;ure, if it be true, as I have rea&s;on to believe upon the&s;e grounds:</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, Upon the te&s;timony of the Reporter, who doth not only here|in affirm this Hi&s;tory to be true, but did it al&s;o by word of mouth, a good while before, and again near the time of his death, when he gave his Papers to the Gentleman, who did lately put them into my hands. The&s;e two Gentlemen came to know
<PB REF="5">
one another at <HI>Smirna,</HI> a little be|fore the <HI>Dutch</HI> Fleet departed from thence, in or about the year 1607. and being both bound for <HI>Holland;</HI> they came together in the &s;ame Ship where by a daily conver&s;e they contracted a very &s;trict friend|&s;hip. This Fleet being attacked in its return, there were many men killed and wounded; and among the re&s;t, the Author of this Relati|on, called Captain <HI>Siden,</HI> was mor|tally wounded, and lived but little after the fight.</P>
<P>Upon his death-bed he made his Friend Heir of what he had in the Ship, and &s;pake to him in this man|ner: as the Gentleman, him&s;elf, hath often declared to me.</P>
<Q>Sir, Since it is Gods Decree that I &s;hould live no longer, I patiently &s;ubmit to his Divine Will without any murmur|ing. But before I die, I am willing to
<PB REF="6">
di&s;po&s;e of a Che&s;t I have in this Ship, where you will find &s;ome Money, and a few Jewels, of no great value, I con|fe&s;s, but &s;uch as they are I give them to you, and I am &s;orry they are not better worth your acceptance, I give you al&s;o the Che&s;t, and every thing in it; and though, it &s;eems, the whole is worth but little, yet you will find a great Trea&s;ure in it, and that is the Hi&s;tory of my Adventures in the South Continent, as you have heard me relate to you &s;everal times. You will find it in a great di&s;order and confu&s;ion for the mo&s;t part; and written in &s;everal Languages, as being intended only to &s;erve for memoires till I could dige&s;t them into an orderly contexture. But &s;ince God will not permit me to do it my &s;elf, I commit it to your care, knowing you are an ingenious per&s;on, and give you full power and authority to di&s;po&s;e of the &s;aid Papers as you will think mo&s;t convenient; a&s;&s;uring you upon my death bed, as I have done before in &s;everal di&s;cour&s;es, that
<PB REF="6">
they contain nothing but truth; which, I hope, time and further experience will bring to light.</Q>
<P>The&s;e were the la&s;t words of the dying Gentleman, who a few hours after gave up his Soul to God; and who, according to his Friends te&s;timony, was a very &s;ober, di&s;creet, and worthy Per&s;on.</P>
<P>After his Death his Heir exa|mined the Papers, and found they were written, for the mo&s;t part, in <HI>Latine;</HI> the re&s;t in <HI>French, Italian,</HI> and <HI>Provencal;</HI> the diver&s;ity of which Languages put him to a great deal of trouble, for he did not un|der&s;tand them all, neither was he willing to tru&s;t the Writings into Strangers hands. The&s;e difficul|ties, together with the confu&s;ion of the Wars that followed, and &s;eve|ral trouble&s;ome Affairs, were the rea&s;on why he kept this Hi&s;tory
<PB REF="7">
concealed all this while, not know|ing whom to tru&s;t it with. But being come from <HI>Holland</HI> into <HI>Eng|land</HI> &s;ince the Peace was proclaimed betwixt the two Nations; and ha|ving contracted &s;ome acquaintance and friend&s;hip with me, he did me the favour a while ago to intru&s;t me with his Papers, and de&s;ired my a&s;&s;i&s;tance in putting them into an orderly method. I peru&s;ed them, and found the matter, therein contained, &s;o extraordinary and wonderful, that I was never at re&s;t till I had di&s;po&s;ed them into a good order and contexture; which I, at la&s;t, effected, not without much la|bour and pains, with the Gentlemans help and coun&s;el.</P>
<P>Now we were a while uncertain in what Language we &s;hould pub|li&s;h this Hi&s;tory, he being inclined to do it in <HI>Latine,</HI> or <HI>French:</HI> But at la&s;t I prevailed with him, and
<PB REF="7">
per&s;waded him to let me Print it in <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> taking the whole task upon my &s;elf.</P>
<P>But before we proceeded in that de&s;ign, I was de&s;irous to enquire after the truth of this di&s;covery &s;ome other way, and told him it were very material to &s;end into <HI>Holland,</HI> to know of the Officers of the Admiralties there, whether any &s;uch Ship, as the <HI>Golden Dragon,</HI> herein mentioned, was at any time gone from thence for <HI>Batavia:</HI> To which he readily an&s;wered, he had &s;atisfied him&s;elf therein, and found upon examination, that a Ve&s;&s;el of that name was gone from the <HI>Texel,</HI> at the time herein expre&s;|&s;ed, with all the other Circum|&s;tances. But this was not enough to &s;atisfie me, becau&s;e I had no|thing but his bare Affirmation: I therefore went to Mr. <HI>Van Dam,</HI> Advocate to the <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> Com|pany
<GAP DESC="missing"></P>
<P><PB REF="8">
But this could not be done, becau&s;e the Dutch Gentleman was then in <HI>Flanders;</HI> whereupon he intreated him to write to him, and de&s;ire him to give the be&s;t account he could of it; which he readily con|&s;ented to, and having &s;ent a Let|ter to his Friend concerning this matter, received the following an|&s;wer, which we have faithfully tran&s;lated out of <HI>French,</HI> and in&s;er|ted it here.</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><HI>ACcording to your de&s;ire, and for your Friends &s;atisfaction, I &s;hall tell you; that when I was at</HI> Batavia, <HI>in the year</HI> 1659, <HI>a</HI> Dutch <HI>Seaman, named</HI> Prince, <HI>hearing that I had been near the South-Continent, told me, that &s;ome years before (I do not remember how many, nor at what height) he was ca&s;t away in a new Ship, called the</HI>
<PB REF="8">
Green, <HI>or</HI> Golden Dragon; <HI>which carried a great deal of Money, de&s;igned for</HI> Batavia, <HI>and about four hundred people; who for the mo&s;t part had got into the &s;aid Land, and kept there the &s;ame Di&s;cipline they had at Sea. That having entrenched them&s;elves, with what they had &s;aved, and among the re&s;t, mo&s;t of their Victuals, they made a new Pinnace out of the broken pieces of their Ship, ca&s;ting Lots for eight men (whereof this Seaman was one) to go to</HI> Batavia, <HI>to inform the General of the</HI> Holland <HI>Company of their di&s;a&s;ter, to the end he might &s;end Ships to fetch tho&s;e who had been ca&s;t away. That Pin|nace being come to</HI> Batavia, <HI>with much ado; The &s;aid General di&s;patched pre|&s;ently a Frigot, which being come to that Coa&s;t, they &s;ent their long Boat a&s;hore with many men, who landed at the place and height to them de&s;cribed before, but found no body there. They ranged along that Coa&s;t till they lo&s;t their Boat, and</HI>
<PB REF="9">
<HI>&s;ome of their men, through the badne&s;s of the weather, which that Coa&s;t is very &s;ubject to, and &s;o returned to</HI> Batavia <HI>without effecting any thing. The Ge|neral &s;ent a &s;econd Frigot, which like|wi&s;e came back, with no better &s;ucce&s;s than the former. People &s;peak different|ly of that Country, &s;ome &s;aying, that in the Inland, there are People of a great Stature; others, that they are little and &s;ubtile, and that they carry tho&s;e they can catch into the inner parts of the Land along with them. I was like to have landed there, but, as through Gods &s;pecial favour, a &s;udden calm in the night &s;aved us from being ca&s;t away; &s;oon after a &s;udden &s;torm made us alter our minds of landing there, and we thought our &s;elves happy to get to Sea again.</HI></P>
<P><HI>This is all I can tell you of this bu&s;ine&s;s: Your Friends may hear more of this Ship from tho&s;e who belong to the</HI> Ea&s;t-India <HI>Company. General</HI>
<PB REF="9">
Maet&s;uycker <HI>was then, and is &s;till, General in</HI> Batavia; <HI>but I had this account only of the Seaman above men|tioned. The Land of this Country is reddi&s;h, and barren, and the Coa&s;ts as if they were enchanted by rea&s;on of frequent &s;torms, which hinder much tho&s;e who will land there: And that is the rea&s;on why the afore&s;aid Frigots lo&s;t their Boats and men. They could not land every where; and this Seaman is of opinion, they could not find the right place. I remain</HI></P>

<P>This is the true Copy of the Letter &s;ent to this French Gentle|man, who has given me the Ori|ginal and I have it &s;till in my po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. He added, That the
<PB REF="10">
<HI>Savoyard</HI> took a Copy of it, and told him, that he him&s;elf had made great enquiry after a Gen|tleman of his Country, who was &s;aid to have gone in this Ship. That the &s;ame Gentleman had been a great Traveller, and had left an E&s;tate near <HI>Nice de Pro|vence,</HI> where he was born, and that his Kindred, not having heard from him for many years, were much troubled to know what was become of him. All the&s;e things are, in my opinion, very &s;trong Arguments to e&s;tabli&s;h the truth of this Hi&s;tory, &s;ince they agree &s;o well with the Hi&s;tory it &s;elf in all the Circum&s;tances of Time, Place, and Per&s;on, and are atte&s;ted by &s;o many credible Wit|ne&s;&s;es, which are yet alive, for the mo&s;t part, and who living in &s;everal places, not knowing one another, and having no intere&s;t in
<PB REF="10">
the publi&s;hing of this Story, can|not rationally be &s;u&s;pected, to have all joyned together to give credit to a Fictitious Nar|ration. But I leave the Reader to the liberty of u&s;ing his own Judgment, and content my &s;elf with &s;hewing the Rea&s;ons which have been able to convince mine. I wi&s;h that tho&s;e who &s;hall read this mo&s;t delightful and admi|rable Relation may reap &s;ome pro|fit out of it either in point of Plea&s;ure or Utility, it being a very ingenious Piece, and the mo&s;t perfect model of Government I ever read or heard of in my life.</P>

<HEAD>The Hi&s;tory of the <HI>Sevarites,</HI> or <HI>Sevarambi.</HI></HEAD>
<P>_MY, Natural Genius, the man|ner of my Education, and the Example of others, in|&s;pired me in my young years with a re&s;tle&s;s de&s;ire of tra|velling the World, that I might my &s;elf be an Eye Witne&s;s of tho&s;e things I had either read or heard of. But the Authority of my Parents, who de&s;igned me for the Gown, and my want of &s;ufficient means, were powerful Ob&s;tacles to my de|&s;ires; and would have confined me at home, had not fortune, mightier than all the&s;e, ordered it contrary to their intent, and according to my wi&s;hes. For before I had attained the fifteenth year of my age, I was &s;ent into <HI>Italy,</HI> in a Military Imploy|ment, which kept me there two whole years before I came home again into my own Country; from whence, &s;oon after my Re|turn, I was obliged to march into <HI>Catalonia</HI> with a better Command than that I had be|fore. I continued there in the Army for the
<PB N="2" REF="12">
&s;pace of three years, and would not have quitted the Service, if my Fathers untimely Death had not called we home again to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a &s;mall E&s;tate he left me, and to obey my Mothers ab&s;olute Commands, who called me back, as the only per&s;on, after &s;o great a lo&s;s, that was able to dry up her tears.</P>
<P>The&s;e Con&s;iderations made me to re|turn; and after that, to leave the Sword, and to put on the Gown, and change a Souldiers life for that of a Lawyer; to which &s;tudy upon this occa&s;ion I did wholly apply my &s;elf; read the In&s;titutions, the Codex, and the Dige&s;ts or Pandects, where having made a pretty good progre&s;s in four or five years time I was per&s;waded to take my De|grees in the Univer&s;ity, which I did accord|ingly with an indifferent good &s;ucce&s;s. Then was I received into the Soveraign Court of Judicature of my Country in the quality of an advocate, as being the fir&s;t &s;tep to higher dignities, exerci&s;ed my &s;elf in Declamations upon fictitious Cau&s;es, and pleaded real and choice ones in <HI>Apparatu,</HI> as they term it, with &s;ome applau&s;e and credit. I was well enough plea&s;ed with the&s;e kinds of exerci&s;es, in which young men love to &s;hew their Wit and Eloquence to the Publick, and where
<PB N="3" REF="12">
they get more prai&s;e than money; But when I de&s;cended to the lower practice of the Law, I found it &s;o crabbed, &s;o mean and &s;lavi&s;h, that in a &s;hort time I was quite weary of it. I carefully examined the ways and means by which Lawyers attain to Riches and Dignities, and found there was much of fraud and indirect proceeding in them, and that unle&s;s I did comply with men of that Calling in all the&s;e vices, I &s;hould never get either Wealth or Credit by my practice. Now being naturally inclined to Ea&s;e and Plea&s;ure, and loving frankne&s;s and hone&s;ty, I clearly perceived I was no ways fit for that Imployment. So while I was thinking and contriving how to ca&s;t it off with &s;ome plau|&s;ible rea&s;on, a fatal accident took away my loving Mother; and although her death made me ab&s;olute Ma&s;ter of my &s;elf and E&s;tate, yet it laid &s;o much grief and &s;orrow on my heart, that all things at home became odious to me, in&s;omuch that I made a &s;trong re&s;olution to leave my Native Land, if not for ever, at lea&s;t for a long time.</P>
<P>Pur&s;uant to this de&s;ign, I di&s;po&s;ed of all my Concerns, except of a &s;mall E&s;tate in Land, which I re&s;erved for a place of retreat in ca&s;e of nece&s;&s;ity, leaving it in the hands of a faithful Friend, who ever &s;ince gave me a
<PB N="4" REF="13">
very good account of it &s;o long as he could hear from me. Having in that manner or|dered my affairs and taken leave of my be&s;t friends, I travelled into the chiefe&s;t Pro|vinces of the Kingdom of <HI>France</HI> 'till I came to the famous City of <HI>Paris,</HI> where I &s;pent al|mo&s;t two years without going above fifty or &s;ixty Miles from it. But the former de&s;ire of &s;eeing more Countries, and an opportunity while I was there of travelling into <HI>Germany</HI> made me depart from that Populous City to go and &s;ee the &s;everal Courts of the Ger|man Princes, tho&s;e of the Kings of <HI>Swede|land</HI> and <HI>Denmark,</HI> and at la&s;t the <HI>Low-Countries,</HI> where I made an end of my <HI>Eu|ropean</HI> travels, and re&s;ted my &s;elf, till the year 1655. in which I took &s;hipping for the <HI>Ea&s;t Indies.</HI></P>
<P>The cau&s;es and motives which induced me to take this long Voyage were the&s;e:</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, My natural curio&s;ity of &s;eeing Countries, and the wonderful relations I had heard or read of tho&s;e remote parts of the world.</P>
<P>Secondly, The earne&s;t &s;olicitations of a Friend who had a concern in <HI>Batavia,</HI> and was bound for that place.</P>
<P>And la&s;t of all, The great gain and pro|fits which I was told would accrue to me
<PB N="5" REF="13">
by this Voyage if it &s;hould prove &s;ucce&s;s|ful.</P>
<P>The&s;e Arguments and Invitations ea&s;ily prevailed with me, &s;o that having in a &s;hort time ordered my affairs, and prepared my &s;elf for this purpo&s;e, I went with my friend aboard a new Ship, called the <HI>Golden Dra|gon,</HI> bound for <HI>Batavia.</HI> She was a Ve&s;&s;el of about &s;ix hundred Tuns, and thirty two Guns, and carried near four hundred People Seamen or Pa&s;&s;engers, and great Sums of Money, where my Friend, called <HI>Mon&s;ieur de Nuits,</HI> had a great concern.</P>
<P>In order to our Voyage we weighed An|chor from the <HI>Texel</HI> on the twelfth day of <HI>April</HI> 1655. and with a fre&s;h Ea&s;terly Wind &s;ailed through the Channel betwixt <HI>France</HI> and <HI>England</HI> with all the &s;peed and good &s;ucce&s;s we could wi&s;h, till we came to the open Seas, and thence pro&s;ecuted our Voyage to the <HI>Canary</HI> I&s;lands with variety of Winds and weather, but no Storms or Tempe&s;ts.</P>
<P>There we took in fre&s;h Provi&s;ions, &s;uch as the I&s;lands afford, and which we had oc|ca&s;ion for; and &s;teering from thence to|wards the I&s;les of <HI>Capo verdo</HI> to fetch a con|&s;tant Trade Wind, we came in &s;ight of them without any accident worth my relating It is true, we &s;aw &s;everal Sea Mon&s;ters, flying
<PB N="6" REF="14">
Fi&s;hes, new Con&s;tellations, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> But becau&s;e tho&s;e things are u&s;ual, that they have been de&s;cribed by others, and have for ma|ny years lo&s;t the grace of Novelties, I pur|po&s;ely omit them, not being willing to in|crea&s;e the Bulk of this Book with unnece&s;&s;ary relations which would but tire the Readers patience and my own.</P>
<P>To proceed therefore with my intended brevity, I think it will be &s;ufficient to tell you that we made the Coa&s;ts of <HI>Bra&s;il,</HI> and got there another Trade Wind, which car|ried us towards the Cape of <HI>Good Hope</HI> with indifferent good &s;ucce&s;s. We doubled the Cape without any danger, and pur&s;ued our Voyage with all chearfulne&s;s and alacrity, till we came to 38 degrees of South Latitude, on the Second day of <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> of the &s;ame year 1655.</P>
<P>Till this time and place Fortune had &s;mi|led upon us, but now &s;he began to frown, for about three or four a clock in the after|noon the Sky began to change its former clearne&s;s and &s;erenity into thick Clouds, Lightnings and Thunders, which were the forerunners of the vehement Winds, Rain, Hail and Tempe&s;t, which &s;ucceeded &s;oon after. The very approach of this violent &s;torm did much terrifie our Seamen, and although
<PB N="7" REF="14">
they had time to take down their Sails, tie fa&s;t their Guns, and order every thing as they thought fit, yet fore&s;eeing the terrible Hurricane that hapned immediately after, they could not chu&s;e but dread the violence and fiercene&s;s of it.</P>
<P>The Sea began to foam, and turn its &s;mooth Surface into Mountains and Vales. The Winds ran all the points of the Com|pa&s;s in le&s;s than two hours time. Our Ship was to&s;&s;ed to and fro, up and down again, in the horride&s;t manner imaginable; one Wind drove us forward, and another beat us back again; our Ma&s;ts, Yards, and Tackling were broken, and the &s;torm was &s;o violent that a great part of our Seamen being &s;ick could hardly hear and obey command.</P>
<P>All this while our Pa&s;&s;engers were kept under Deck, and my Friend and I lay at the main Ma&s;t &s;adly ca&s;t down, and both re|penting, he for his covetous de&s;ire of gain, and I for my fooli&s;h curio&s;ity. We wi&s;hed our &s;elves a hundred times in <HI>Holland,</HI> and as often de&s;paired ever to &s;ee it again, or any other Land, for any would have &s;erved our turn then. He was a very hone&s;t young man, but no Souldier nor Seaman. At the begin|ing of the &s;torm I was full of courage, and well re&s;olved to &s;ubmit to the will of God
<PB N="8" REF="15">
without any murmuring or fear of dying, but he did not under&s;tand that Philo&s;ophy, the dreadful image of Death appeared to him with all his horrour, and I think I might have &s;een it in his face if we had not been in the dark. I have admired he did not die for the very fear of it: At fir&s;t he &s;igh'd and and groaned only, but a while after, when the &s;torm increa&s;ed, he broke out into the &s;adde&s;t howling in the world.</P>
<P>He accu&s;ed his Fathers Coun&s;el and Com|mand, who had &s;ent him, but chiefly his own folly in obeying. He called his dear Mother, Brothers, and Si&s;ters, and bad them an Eternal Farewel, as likewi&s;e his beloved Country, which he had no hopes ever to &s;ee again. He lamented and deplored the cruelty of his Fate that put an end to his life in the flower of his Age by &s;o horrid and untimely a Death. In fine, he made &s;uch &s;ad com|plaints, and was &s;o eloquent in his affliction, that I was moved with Compa&s;&s;ion more than with the fear of being drowned. Pity fir&s;t wrought upon my heart, and drove out of it all the Stoicity my rea&s;on had laid there in &s;tore; then fear and infirmity came in, &s;o that I began to howl and lament with my afflicted Friend, as if I had been as weak as he, and had it not been for &s;ome ridiculous
<PB N="9" REF="15">
Expre&s;&s;ions of his, which made me &s;ome|times laugh, I think I had been as much de|jected as he.</P>
<P>Mans weakne&s;s and &s;implicity is much to be admired in &s;uch occa&s;ions as this, and &s;hews that Cu&s;tom, Prejudices, and Opinions, have more influence upon his mind than true rea&s;on he &s;o much boa&s;ts of, and which in &s;uch occurrences as this for&s;akes him, and leaves the ma&s;tery of his Soul to weak and &s;illy Pa&s;|&s;ions. Death is but one and the &s;ame thing what &s;hape &s;oever it a&s;&s;umes to appear in, and we commonly fear the manner of Death more than Death it &s;elf.</P>
<P>Before this &s;torm (wherein none of our People peri&s;hed by the &s;pecial Grace of God) I had been expo&s;ed to a great deal more dan|ger than I was now; I had been expo&s;ed to the mouth of Canons, I had fought in Bat|tels, and in Sieges, where many thou&s;ands of men had lo&s;t their lives, and where we marched upon the &s;lain to a &s;eeming inevita|ble Death: Yet the fear of it did hardly make an Impre&s;&s;ion on my heart becau&s;e it was an u&s;ual thing, and the contempt of dan|ger as much accounted courage and gallantry as the fear of it cowardline&s;s and infamy, yet death is &s;till but one and the &s;ame thing.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="16">
While my Friend and I were thus lament|ing, the Ma&s;ter and his Crew were not a&s;leep, neither did they neglect any thing that could contribute to our pre&s;ervation; They u&s;ed all their art, and all their endea|vours, &s;ome about the Stern, &s;ome about the Pumps, and others about &s;everal other parts of the Ship; and God did &s;o ble&s;s their labour, that they kept her up while the vio|lent Hurrricane la&s;ted, which at la&s;t fell into one particular Wind, that got the ma&s;tery of the others, and drove us to the South|ward with &s;o great rapidity that we were not able to keep out of that Cour&s;e, but mu&s;t yield to his violence. After two days running that Cour&s;e the Wind changed a little, and drove us to the Southea&s;t for the &s;pace of three days, the weather being &s;o foggy that we could &s;ee nothing at five or &s;ix yards di&s;tance. On the &s;ixth day the Wind &s;laked a little, but drove us &s;till to the Southea&s;t till towards night, when of a &s;udden we felt a very great Calm, ju&s;t as if our Ship had fallen into a Pool or dead Lake, which cau&s;ed no &s;mall wonder in us. Two or three hours after we were thus be|calmed the weather cleared up, and we &s;pied a great many Stars, but could not make any good ob&s;ervation by them. We judged
<PB N="11" REF="16">
in general that we were not far from <HI>Bata|via,</HI> and a great many Leagues from the South Continent: But it proved afterwards we were much deceived in our Conjecture. The &s;eventh day we continued in this great Calm, as if we had been ordered to cele|brate the Sabbath day after &s;ix days labour and toyl; during this Calm we &s;earched and examined all the parts of our Ship, and found her pretty tight, though &s;he was a new Ship, and had never gone a Voyage before. But &s;he was &s;o &s;trongly built that &s;he endured the rage of the Seas without &s;pringing any Leak able to endamage her. The eighth day at Noon a fine breeze began to blow, and drove us to the Ea&s;tward, much to our joy and &s;atisfaction, for be&s;ides that it made for our purpo&s;e, we were afraid of being be|calmed; at night the weather grew dark and mi&s;ty, and the Wind &s;tiff and violent, &s;o that we feared another &s;torm The Fog continued all the day following, and the wind blowing by fits and puffs, which did &s;ometimes put us to great danger, at night the Wind changed, grew boi&s;terous and drove us again to the Southea&s;t with great impetuo&s;ity, the Fog growing &s;till thicker and thicker. About the middle of the night, the Wind being very high, and our Ship
<PB N="12" REF="17">
running very &s;wiftly, &s;he &s;truck of a &s;udden upon a Bank, much contrary to our ex|pectation, and &s;tuck there &s;o fa&s;t that &s;he remained there without any motion as if &s;he had been nailed to the place. Then did we think our &s;elves ab&s;olutely lo&s;t, and looked every moment to &s;ee our Ship &s;taved in pieces by the fury of the Seas and Wind, and every body fell to his Prayers &s;eeing neither Art nor Indu&s;try could avail. But God, who&s;e mercies are great, &s;hewed us &s;alvati|on where we expected nothing but de&s;tru|ction; for the Morning being come, and the Sun having expelled the darkne&s;s of the Night, and di&s;&s;ipated the thickne&s;s of the Fog, we &s;aw that our Ve&s;&s;el &s;tuck upon a Bank near the &s;hore of a great I&s;land or Continent. The di&s;covery of this Land turned our de&s;pair into hopes, for although it was unknown to us, and we could not tell what good or bad fortune we &s;hould have in it: Yet any Land was then welcome to men who had during many days been &s;o mi|&s;erably to&s;&s;ed upon the water betwixt life and death, hopes and de&s;pair.</P>
<P>About Noon the weather grew very clear and hot, the Sun over-powring the Mi&s;t and Fog, and the Wind abating much of his violence, &s;o that the Sea did by degrees
<PB N="13" REF="17">
lo&s;e much of his rage and agitation. In the Afternoon about three a Clock it Ebbed from the &s;hore, and left our Ship with le&s;s than five foot of water upon a kind of a muddy Sand where &s;he &s;tuck very fa&s;t. The place where &s;he &s;tuck was not above a Musket &s;hot from a pretty high but acce&s;&s;ible &s;hore, whither we re&s;olved to remove our &s;elves and our goods whatever &s;hould come on't, and in order to it our Long-boat was let down, and twelve of our &s;toute&s;t men were &s;ent a&s;hore well armed to di&s;cover the Coun|try, and to chu&s;e a place near the Sea where we might encamp with &s;ome &s;afety without going far from our Ship. As &s;oon as they were landed they carefully viewed the Coun|try from the top of a ri&s;ing ground not far from the &s;hore, but &s;aw neither Hou&s;es, nor Inhabitants, nor any &s;igns of either, the Country being but a Sandy barren Land, where grew nothing but bu&s;hes and little &s;hrubs wild and &s;avage. They could &s;ee nei|ther River nor Brook in the parts they had di&s;covered; and not having time to make a farther &s;earch that day, nor counting it pru|dence to venture any farther into &s;o unknown a place, they came back again to the Ship three hours after their landing. The next Morning we &s;ent them a&s;hore again with
<PB N="14" REF="18">
provi&s;ions, and order to &s;end the Boat back again to fetch our People by degrees, and likewi&s;e our Provi&s;ions and Goods, which were all whole by Gods mercy without any the lea&s;t damage. All the&s;e Orders were exe|cuted with great care and diligence, &s;o that the day after our being ca&s;t upon the Bank we got all a&s;hore with a good part of our Provi&s;ions and Goods mo&s;t u&s;eful and nece&s;|&s;ary. The fir&s;t who landed pitched the Camp on the &s;ide of a ri&s;ing ground near the Sea over again&s;t our Ve&s;&s;el, which could co|ver us on the Land &s;ide from being &s;een by any body that &s;hould come towards the &s;hore, and afforded us a convenient &s;tation for a Sentinel to di&s;cover a good way round about. Thither did we by degrees carry our goods, leaving in the Ship but ten or twelve men to keep her till we could tow her off up|on high water, if it was po&s;&s;ible, or di&s;po&s;e of her otherwi&s;e.</P>
<P>One of the fir&s;t things we did &s;o &s;oon as we were landed was to call a Council, to ad|vi&s;e what order we &s;hould take for our mu|tual pre&s;ervation. It was pre&s;ently re&s;olved that we &s;hould keep for the pre&s;ent upon the Land the &s;ame order and di&s;cipline we kept at Sea, till &s;uch times we &s;hould think fit to alter it; &s;o after this re&s;olution it was
<PB N="15" REF="18">
agreed, we &s;hould humble our &s;elves before God Almighty, to give him mo&s;t hearty thanks for pre&s;erving our lives and goods in &s;o &s;pecial a manner, and to implore his di|vine a&s;&s;i&s;tance for the future in a place alto|gether unknown to us, and where we might fall into the hands of &s;ome barba|rous people, or &s;tarve there for want of Pro|vi&s;ions, if he in his mercy did not provide for us as he had done heretofore.</P>
<P>After this Re&s;olution and humiliation our Officers divided our People into three equal parts, whereof two were ordered ince&s;&s;ant|ly to work about the Camp in drawing of a Trench to &s;ecure us from any &s;udden inva|&s;ion, and the others were imployed in di&s;|covering the Country, and fetching in Wood and &s;uch kind of &s;upplies. Tho&s;e who were left aboard the Ship had orders to &s;ee what condition &s;he was in, and what could be done with her. After an exact exa|mination they found that her Keel was broke by the violent &s;hock &s;he gave again&s;t the Sand, and that &s;he &s;tuck &s;o fa&s;t in it, that it was impo&s;&s;ible to tow her off if &s;he were ne|ver &s;o &s;ound, &s;o that they thought the be&s;t way was to take her in pieces, and build a Pinnace or two out of her ruines to &s;ent to <HI>Batavia</HI> with all &s;peed and diligence. That
<PB N="16" REF="19">
Coun&s;el was approved of, and the fitte&s;t men for that purpo&s;e were employed for the execution of it with all diligence. The parties that were &s;ent to di&s;cover dur&s;t not venture far in the Plain for fear of &s;ome dan|ger or ill accident, till &s;uch a time that the Camp was better fortified, and the Guns carried thither from the Ship. They brought in only Wood, and &s;ome kind of wild Ber|ries, of which they found great quantities upon the bu&s;hes and &s;hrubs of the place; &s;ome &s;preading along the &s;hore found a very great plenty of Oy&s;ters, Mu&s;cles, and other Shell fi&s;h, which did not only refre&s;h our People, but did al&s;o much &s;ave our Provi&s;ions, which upon examination we found could not hold out above two Months according to the ordinary allowance: The con&s;idera|tion whereof made us think of &s;ome way to husband it, which could be but by getting and &s;aving. In the fir&s;t place we u&s;ed all di|ligence to get our Nets and Hooks ready, for we had found that the Sea thereabouts was very full of fi&s;h; we fed as much as we could upon the Berries of the Plain, and upon the Shell fi&s;h of the &s;hore; and on the other &s;ide we &s;hortned every ones allowance, and reduced it to eight ounces a day of the Ships Provi&s;ions. But our greate&s;t want was
<PB N="17" REF="19">
&s;weet water, for although we had made a Well in the Trench that afforded as much of it as we could u&s;e, yet it was &s;omewhat bracki&s;h and ungrateful by rea&s;on of the near|ne&s;s of the Sea.</P>
<P>Our adventurers made every day &s;ome new di&s;covery, and having gone &s;o far as almo&s;t Ten Miles about the Camp without finding any the lea&s;t &s;ign that the Country was inha|bited grew every day bolder and bolder: They &s;aw no living Creature in all this &s;andy Plain, but &s;ome Snakes, a kind of a Rat al|mo&s;t as big as a Rabbet, and &s;ome kind of Birds like wild Pigeons, but &s;omewhat big|ger, who fed upon the Berries we have made mention of. They killed &s;ome of them with their Guns and brought them to the Camp, where after trial they were found to be very good meat, e&s;pecially the Birds.</P>
<P>The&s;e new di&s;coveries made us a little re|mi&s;s in our Fortifications, and we contented our &s;elves by drawing a &s;mall Trench about our Camp, ca&s;ting up the Earth inwardly, and thought it was enough in a place where we found no Inhabitants. We planted &s;ome Guns upon the mo&s;t convenient places, and &s;etting all thoughts of fear a&s;ide, dreaded no|thing &s;o much as hunger, and the injuries we might receive from the weather, which
<PB N="18" REF="20">
we were not yet acquainted with, for it had proved very temperate &s;ince our Landing up|on that Coa&s;t, where we had been fourteen days before our Pinnace could be perfected. But about the &s;eventeenth day &s;he was ready to put to Sea with Provi&s;ion for Eight men for &s;ix weeks time, which was as much as ever we could &s;pare. Now there aro&s;e great &s;trife among&s;t the Seamen about the &s;ending of the Pinnace to <HI>Battavia,</HI> for few would venture on that Voyage, yet it was nece&s;&s;ary that &s;ome &s;hould go. Whereupon it was agreed that a number of the be&s;t Seamen &s;hould be taken out of the whole Crue, and that they &s;hould ca&s;t Lots among them|&s;elves to determine the difference, which was done accordingly. The Lot fell upon the Ma&s;ter him&s;elf, upon a Seaman called <HI>Prince,</HI> and &s;ix more, who&s;e names I have forgotten. They &s;eeing it was the will of Fortune that they &s;hould go, &s;ubmitted to it joyfully, and after having agreed upon a Signal we &s;hould give them, to find us out if ever they &s;hould come again with relief, and taking their leave of the Company, they went aboard the Pinnace, and with a good Land Gale &s;ailed to the Ea&s;tward till they were out of our &s;ight. We made publick Prayers for their pro&s;perity with many
<PB N="19" REF="20">
&s;ighs and tears, tru&s;ting in Gods goodne&s;s and mercy.</P>
<P>The &s;ame day we advi&s;ed among our &s;elves what kind of Government we &s;hould keep as mo&s;t convenient for our pre&s;ent Con|dition, for &s;ome of our Officers being gone in the Pinnace our Sea Di&s;cipline was &s;ome|what altered, neither did we judge it pro|per for the Land, upon better con&s;idera|tion.</P>
<P>The bu&s;ine&s;s was debated <HI>Pro</HI> and <HI>Con,</HI> but after &s;ome conte&s;tation it was agreed that we &s;hould live in a Military Di&s;cipline under a Captain General. And other inferiour Offi|cers, which together &s;hould compo&s;e a So|veraign Council of War with Authority to direct and order every thing ab&s;olutely. Now the que&s;tion was whom we &s;hould chu&s;e of all the Company. All were inclined to defer that honour to <HI>Van de Nuits,</HI> my Friend, as being the Per&s;on of mo&s;t eminent quality among them, and who had the greate&s;t concern in the Ship, but he mode&s;t|ly excu&s;ed him&s;elf, alledging that he was young and unexperienced in Military Affairs, and therefore not fit for &s;uch Command, and that it was nece&s;&s;ary in &s;uch an occa&s;ion to make choice of a Per&s;on of riper years and greater experience in that kind than
<PB N="20" REF="21">
him&s;elf was, who never was a Souldier. Then, ob&s;erving &s;ome trouble and irre&s;oluti|ons in their faces, he went on in this manner:</P>
<Q><HI>Gentlemen, I give you many thanks for the e&s;teem and good will you &s;hew towards me, and wi&s;h heartily I were worthy of it, and capable of this Command; But &s;ince I cannot be your General my &s;elf, give me leave to recommend one to you who is very fit for that Imployment, having been a Commander in</HI> Europe <HI>in two &s;e|veral Armies and a great Traveller in mo&s;t parts of the Chri&s;tian World. You know his Per|&s;on, and I dare &s;ay you do all love and e&s;teem of him as I do, although he is not &s;o well known to you as he is to me, who have had long experi|ence of his probity and good Conduct.</HI> Then (poynting to me) he &s;aid, <HI>The Per&s;on I mean is Captain</HI> Siden, <HI>to who&s;e Command and Au|thority I will readily &s;ubmit if you plea&s;e to chu&s;e him for our General.</HI></Q>
<P>This unexpected Speech, and the looks of the Company, who all turned their eyes upon me, put me &s;omewhat out of Coun|tenance, but being &s;oon come to my &s;elf, I an&s;wered, That his recommendation pro|ceeded more out of affection and love than
<PB N="21" REF="21">
out of any knowledge of either merit or good Conduct in me; that I was a Foreigner among them, and born in a Country far from <HI>Holland,</HI> and that I thought there were many in the Company far more capable of that Command than I was, and therefore de&s;ired to be excu&s;ed, chu&s;ing rather to obey my betters than to u&s;e any Authority over them. I had no &s;ooner ended my Speech, but one <HI>Swart</HI> (a &s;tout and active fellow, who never went out of my company in all the di&s;coveries we had made in the Coun|try) took me up &s;omewhat briskly, and &s;aid:
<Q><HI>Sir, All the&s;e excu&s;es will not &s;erve your turn, and if Mr.</HI> Van de Nuits <HI>coun&s;el and mine be taken you &s;hall be our General whether you will or no; for be&s;ides what he hath wor|thily &s;poken of you, all the Company (and I particularly) know that &s;ince we were ca&s;t up|on this Land you have &s;hewed your &s;elf mo&s;t active and indu&s;trious for the common good and pre&s;ervation of all, and are therefore mo&s;t fit to command us. We are Seamen and Traders, alto|gether ignorant of Military Di&s;cipline, which you alone can teach us here, &s;ince there is no body among us that under&s;tands it, and who is &s;o well qualified as your &s;elf, upon which con&s;ideration I</HI>

<P>This blunt Fellows Speech, which he pronounced with a &s;trong and loud voice, did &s;o affect the minds of the Company, al|ready di&s;po&s;ed by <HI>Van de Nuits</HI> recommen|dation, that all with one voice cried out, Captain <HI>Siden</HI> mu&s;t be our General.</P>
<P>When I &s;aw I could not avoid the taking of this Command, I made &s;ign for &s;ilence, and &s;pake to them in this manner:</P>
<Q><P><HI>Gentlemen, Since you force me to accept of this Command, I accept it with thanks to you all, and do heartily wi&s;h your choice may prove to your advantage and &s;atisfaction. But that all things may be done in good order, and carried on vigorou&s;ly I beg a few things of you, which if you plea&s;e to grant me I will do my be&s;t endeavour to pre&s;erve you from all danger, and to keep you in that Civil Di&s;cipline and Society which may be&s;t conduce to the Publick Good.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The fir&s;t thing I beg, That every man here will take an Oath to obey mine and the Councils Authority without any repugnancy, upon pain of &s;uch puni&s;hments as we &s;hall think fit to inflict upon them.</HI></P>

<P><HI>In the third place I beg, That in Council my &s;ingle Vote may pa&s;s for three Votes.</HI></P>

<P>All the&s;e Priviledges and Prerogatives were pre&s;ently granted me, and I was &s;alu|ted by all the Multitude in the quality of their General, and had a Tent larger than ordinary &s;et up in the middle of the Camp for the fir&s;t Badge of my Authority. I lay in it that night with <HI>Van de Nuits;</HI> and had his advice in &s;everal things, which were af|terwards put in execution.</P>
<P>The next day we called all our People to|gether, and in their pre&s;ence I made <HI>Van de Nuits</HI> Over-&s;eer General of all the Goods and Provi&s;ions we had, or &s;hould hereafter have. <HI>Swart</HI> Captain of the Artillery, Arms, and Ammunitions of War. <HI>Maurice,</HI> an ex|pert and active Seaman, Admiral of our Fleet, which was to con&s;i&s;t of a Long-boat, a little Boat, and another Pinnace we were a making out of the pieces of our broken Ship. <HI>Morton,</HI> an Engli&s;h man, who had

<P>I gave all the&s;e men leave to chu&s;e their inferiour Officers with my approbation, which they did accordingly.</P>
<P>I had two Servants with me, the one cal|led <HI>Deve&s;e,</HI> who had been my Serjeant in <HI>Ca|talonia,</HI> a &s;tout and under&s;tanding fellow, &s;o|ber, and tru&s;ty, who had &s;erved me ever &s;ince I left the Wars, and followed my fortune every where, him I made my Lieutenant General; and the other, named <HI>Tur&s;i,</HI> my Secretary.</P>
<P>Our Officers being all cho&s;en, we num|bred our People, and found we were three hundred and &s;even Men, three Boys, and &s;eventy four Women, all in good health; for although there were many of them &s;ick when they fir&s;t landed, they were all well again in le&s;s than a Weeks time, which was no &s;mall argument of the healthine&s;s of the Country. I di&s;tributed all the&s;e into four parts, and gave <HI>Maurice</HI> &s;ix and twenty of the be&s;t Seamen, and the three Boys, to man his Navy. <HI>Swart</HI> had thirty for his Ar|tillery.

<P>All our Affairs being &s;o ordered and &s;et|led, in the Evening I called our Superiour Officers together, and told them, that be|fore our Provi&s;ions were all &s;pent we &s;hould go about by Sea and Land to di&s;cover the Country, and endeavour to get &s;ome fre&s;h Provi&s;ion, as likewi&s;e to di&s;cover &s;ome fitter place for a Camp than that we were in, where in a &s;hort time all things would grow &s;carce, and where we had not &s;o much as good water. That my opinion was we &s;hould &s;end &s;everal Parties of men well Armed to make new di&s;coveries, and go farther into the Country than we had gone yet. They readily a&s;&s;ented to my Propo&s;als, and told me they were ready to obey my Orders.</P>
<P>Whereupon I commanded <HI>Maurice</HI> to man his two Boats, and to &s;end them all along
<PB N="26" REF="25">
the Coa&s;ts, as far as they could conveniently go, the one, on the right &s;ide of the Camp, and the other, on the left. I ordered <HI>Morton</HI> to take twenty men out of his Company, and to go all along the &s;hore on the left hand. <HI>De Haes</HI> was commanded to take thirty out of his, and to go through the middle of the Country; and I my &s;elf drew forty men out of the two other Companies, and left my Lieutenant to command in the Camp in my ab&s;ence.</P>
<P>We all took three days Provi&s;ion, and good &s;tore of Powder and Bullets, with Swords and half Pikes, and I commanded all my men to be ready early in the Morning, and to wait for further Orders, which they did accordingly. The next day, which was the twentieth &s;ince the fir&s;t day of our Landing, and from which we &s;hall hereafter reckon as our principal <HI>Epoche,</HI> all my men were ready by break of day, and came to receive my Commands, which were the &s;ame I had given the night before, with this Addition only: That if they &s;hould meet with any thing con&s;iderable they &s;hould pre|&s;ently &s;end advice thereof to the Camp. I likewi&s;e gave Orders to <HI>Morton</HI> to keep with the Boat as near as he could, and to come every night to the &s;hore to joyn with the
<PB N="27" REF="25">
Boats-Crew before Sun &s;etting, I my &s;elf intending to keep the &s;ame Method with <HI>Maurice.</HI></P>
<P>As &s;oon as the&s;e Orders were given we went our &s;everal ways all full of hopes and alacrity. I marched my men in Rank and File, and I divided them into three Parties, the fir&s;t that had the Van was compo&s;ed of &s;ix Musketteers and a Corporal, the &s;econd of twelve and a Serjeant, I my &s;elf brought up the Rear.</P>
<P>We marched within Musket &s;hot di&s;tance one from another in that manner as near the &s;hore as we could, that we might be within &s;ight of our Boat. The Sea was very calm, and the Weather very &s;till, though &s;omething hot. At noon the Boat came to us at a place where we &s;tood near the &s;hore, and there we took &s;ome re&s;t and refre&s;hment for the &s;pace of two hours. All the Country we came upon for ten or twelve Miles was much like to that about our Camp, and we did not &s;o much as find a Brook or a Spring in all our way, all being dry Sands, and nothing growing upon them but Bu&s;hes and Thorns. After we had taken &s;ome re&s;t, we marched five Miles beyond the place where we had halted, and there the ground began to grow more unequal, and to ri&s;e here and there
<PB N="28" REF="26">
into &s;mall Hills. Two Miles farther we found a Brook of &s;weet water, which gave us no &s;mall occa&s;ion of joy, chiefly when we &s;aw that a little farther up in the Country there was &s;ome &s;mall plots of green Trees upon the Banks of the Brook; there we halted again, and made Signs to our Boat to come to us, which they did immediately, coming into the Brook with the Tide; and finding it was a very good Harbour for &s;uch a Ve&s;&s;el as theirs, they rowed up a Mile into the Land till they came to a plot of green trees, where we pitched our Camp for that night. <HI>Maurice</HI> brought us &s;ome Fi&s;h he had taken in the Sea, and &s;ome Oy&s;ters, and other Shell fi&s;h. We &s;trook fire, went to Supper an hour before night, and then to &s;leep, keeping a good Guard about us, and hiding our fire with green Boughs we fixed in the ground round about it le&s;t it &s;hould be &s;een at a di&s;tance. The next day early in the morn|ing I &s;ent three of my men back again to the Camp to give them notice of the Brook and the Trees we had found, and to tell them we intended to proceed farther. But before we removed from that place I &s;ent five men up the Brook to di&s;cover more of the Coun|try. They came back two hours after, and told us that the Country above was a little
<PB N="29" REF="26">
more Hilly than below, but dry and barren, and like that which lay towards our Camp. Our Boat fell down towards the Sea after the&s;e men were come with this account, and had carried us over the Brook, which was deep and not fordable, unle&s;s we went two or three Miles higher. When we had got over we marched on along the &s;hore &s;till within &s;ight of our Boat, and found that the Coun|try grew more and more unequal.</P>
<P>When we had gone five or &s;ix Miles fur|ther we came to a pretty high Hill, which was barren and without Trees. We got on the top of it, and from thence di&s;covered a Wood of tall Trees four or five Miles be|yond this Hill, which Trees &s;tood upon a high ground that &s;hot a good way into the Sea.</P>
<P>At the &s;ight of the&s;e green Trees we did much rejoyce, and re&s;olved to go thither after we had taken a little refre&s;hment. We marched on through a Sandy Plain that lay betwixt us and the Wood, and reached the foot of the high ground in le&s;s than two hours time, got up into the Wood, and found it did con&s;i&s;t of very lofty Trees, not thick, and under which there was not much under-wood, &s;o that it was ea&s;ily pervious; there I kept my men very clo&s;e to one
<PB N="30" REF="27">
another, and doubled the Van, that they might be the more able to re&s;i&s;t if they &s;hould be &s;et upon by any men or fierce Bea&s;t. As we went we cut down &s;everal Boughs, and &s;trewed them upon the ground, where|by we might know the way we came in our return. In that manner we marched on in as direct a Line as we could till we came to the other &s;ide of the Wood, where we &s;pied the Sea again, and &s;aw Trees over the Water at &s;ix or &s;even Miles di&s;tance, which demon|&s;trated to us that this water was a great Bay between two Capes.</P>
<P>The place was very delightful to behold, and afforded a very fine pro&s;pect over the Bay, which made us wi&s;h we had been ca&s;t away nearer to it than we were. We had left our Boat on the other &s;ide of the Wood by rea&s;on of the great way &s;he mu&s;t go about before we could meet her again. I &s;ent down ten of my men to the Water &s;ide, where they found a va&s;t quantity of Oy&s;ters, and other Shel-fi&s;h, which was no &s;mall encouragement. As &s;oon as they were come up I &s;ent three men to <HI>Maurice,</HI> and bid him row as fa&s;t as he could towards the head of the Cape, where he &s;hould meet with a Party I intended to &s;end immediately that way. I &s;ent another Party towards the inner part of the Wood on the
<PB N="31" REF="27">
Land &s;ide to &s;ee if they could find any &s;weet water. Tho&s;e who went towards the head of the Cape travelled almo&s;t two Miles before they found any, but at la&s;t they perceived a Declivity in the ground, which led them down into a kind of a Vale, very full of green and thick Trees, at the bottom of which they found a fine &s;tream of &s;weet wa|ter, running into the Bay. In this plea&s;ant place they &s;topped, and &s;ent three of their Company to bring me notice of it; they had not been come a quarter of an hour but the ten men, who were &s;ent on the contrary &s;ide, came back again, and told us they had gone a great way in the Wood, which they thought grew wider and wider towards the Land; that they had found a Heard of Deer near a little Brook, whereof they had killed two, and &s;hot at two more. They had cut the&s;e Deer into four pieces, and carried them upon their backs, which was no un|comfortable &s;ight to us. We left the place where we &s;tood, and marched towards the Vale above mentioned, having before di|&s;patched five of our men towards the Camp, to give them notice of what had hapned to us, and &s;ent them part of our Veni&s;on for a token of the good Fortune we had met with. When we were come to the Vale, I
<PB N="32" REF="28">
liked it &s;o well, that I re&s;olved to encamp there that night, and to remove our old Camp thither, as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ibly we could. My men made pre&s;ently a fire, and fell a roa&s;ting of their Veni&s;on; and I &s;ent five of them to meet with the Party which were &s;ent to <HI>Maurice;</HI> they marched but two Miles farther before they came to the head of the Cape, where they joyned with the other Party, and there &s;tanding all together, upon the mo&s;t eminent place they could find, looked for <HI>Maurice</HI> his coming. He as &s;oon as he had received my Orders, Rowed to the Rendezvous with all the diligence po&s;&s;ible, and came to the place half an hour before Sun &s;etting, where having pulled the Boat upon the ground, they all came to the new Camp before it was night.</P>
<P>They found us very merry, &s;ome about the fire roa&s;ting of meat, and others lying upon Beds of dry leaves and dry Mo&s;s, which they had gathered good &s;tore of in a little time.</P>
<P>We pa&s;&s;ed all the night in that place with a great deal of joy and quietne&s;s, and the morning being come I got up betimes, and bid <HI>Maurice</HI> and his Crew to prepare for the old Camp, whither I intended to return by Water with only two of my men be&s;ides
<PB N="33" REF="28">
the Boats Crew. I left one to Command the re&s;t, and ordered him to keep in that place till he heard farther from me, promi&s;ing to be with him again in le&s;s than three days, and that in the mean while they might &s;upply their wants with Hunting, Fi&s;hing, and Shelling; &s;o we went towards the Boat. We &s;oon reached the place where &s;he lay, put her to Sea, and Rowed to the old Camp the &s;ame day, a gentle breeze favouring our Voyage; we arrived about Sun &s;etting, and were received by our People with general demon&s;trations of joy. They had heard of the new Camp, and all asked me if they &s;hould not remove thither? I an&s;wered, We would do that with all &s;peed, it being the be&s;t place to pitch upon of all tho&s;e we had &s;een.</P>
<P><HI>Morton</HI> and <HI>De Haes</HI> were come to the Camp two or three hours before my arrival, and came to give me an account of their Ex|peditions.</P>
<P><HI>Morton</HI> told me, he had marched his men fifteen or &s;ixteen Miles to the left &s;ide of the Camp through a Sandy and barren Country, where they had not found &s;o much as a Spring or Brook of &s;weet Water; that at night they were gone to meet the Boat on the &s;hore, according to my Orders, and lain
<PB N="34" REF="29">
there till the next morning, which being come, they departed early from that place, and proceeded to the We&s;tward in the &s;ame manner as the day before, through a Rocky and Stony Country, without finding any water till Noon; at which time they came to a pretty broad River, where they &s;topt till their Boat came to them. That they had ob|&s;erved the Tide came into this River with great noi&s;e and Impetuo&s;ity, and that the water was &s;alt where they came to it at fir&s;t, as being not far from the Sea, which had obliged them to go up the River till they &s;hould find &s;weet water. That going up along the Banks they had at the la&s;t found a Stream of &s;weet water, which refre&s;hed them much, and &s;o proceeded in their di&s;co|very; they had been &s;et upon by two great Crocodiles, which ran out of the River to devour them, but that they having &s;pied them before they could come near, had fired at them, and the report of their Guns had &s;o frighted tho&s;e Mon&s;ters that they ran into the water with more ha&s;te than they were come out of it. That &s;eeing the danger there was along that River by rea&s;on of the&s;e, or other fierce Creatures they might meet with; and having no Provi&s;ion to go on any fur|ther in a Country where they could get
<PB N="35" REF="29">
nothing but &s;ome Shell-fi&s;h, and tho&s;e only upon the Sea-&s;hore, they thought they &s;hould proceed no farther, but come back again the &s;ame way they were gone, according to my Command of not &s;taying longer without &s;ome &s;pecial rea&s;on.</P>
<P><HI>De Haes</HI> told me he had marched twenty Miles the fir&s;t day through a Sandy Plain, di|rectly to the Southward. That at night they were come to a little Hill full of Heath, where they lay till next morning. That when the Sun began to &s;hine they &s;aw a very great Mi&s;t five or &s;ix Miles beyond their Po&s;t, which clearing up by degrees, as they marched towards it, they di&s;covered a great Pool or Lake of &s;tanding water, which could be no le&s;s than ten Miles Diameter. That being come near this Lake they had &s;een abundance of Reeds and Ru&s;hes grow|ing about the &s;hore, and an infinite number of Water-Fowl, that flew from place to place, and made a very great noi&s;e in their flight.</P>
<P>That they had gone a good way about this Lake before they could come to touch the water by rea&s;on of the Mar&s;hy and Muddy ground about it, where they could not march without danger of &s;inking, till they came to a Sandy place near a Hill, &s;ome|what
<PB N="36" REF="30">
higher than that they lay upon the night before. That having got to the top of it, from whence they had a very large pro|&s;pect round about, they could di&s;cover no|thing but a large Heath, and at great di|&s;tance towards the South, a long Row of very high Mountains, which &s;tood like a Wall, and reached from Ea&s;t to We&s;t as far as they could &s;ee. That after this di&s;covery, they, being afraid of wanting Victuals, were returned to the Camp on the third day ac|cording to my Command.</P>
<P>I found by the&s;e relations that I had had far better luck than the&s;e two Captains, and we were all the more encouraged to go to the new Camp on the Ea&s;tward; that we &s;aw it had &s;uch conveniences as we could not find any where el&s;e, and that all our hopes lay on that &s;ide.</P>
<P>The next morning I called a Council, where I propounded our removal to the green Vale. It was embraced pre&s;ently, and ordered that we &s;hould tran&s;port our People and Goods thither by degrees, beginning with tho&s;e which were mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary and ea&s;ie to carry. The New Pinnace we were making was almo&s;t fini&s;hed, and would be ready in four or five days more, and fit to tran&s;port our Guns, Casks, and other Lum|ber.</P>
<P><PB N="37" REF="30">
In the mean while we u&s;ed both our Boats to remove our Provi&s;ions, and &s;ent many of our People by Land, with &s;uch Axes, Nails, Spades, and other Implements of that kind as we had there.</P>
<P>The Major went with the fir&s;t Party, my Lieutenant with the &s;econd; and when I &s;aw that mo&s;t of our People and Goods were removed to the new Camp, and that the Pinnace was ready, I &s;ent her loaded with diver&s;e things, and travelled thither my &s;elf by Land.</P>
<P>I omitted to tell you that <HI>Maurice</HI> had doubled the Cape in his &s;econd Voyage with|out any danger by rea&s;on of the calmne&s;s of the Sea, and the &s;tilne&s;s of the weather, which was clear and &s;erene, without any Rain or great Wind above &s;ix weeks after our Landing, and &s;o temperate that we felt neither heat not cold in the fir&s;t Month ex|cept about noon, at which time the Sun was &s;omething hot; grew hotter every day as it drew nearer to us, and brought the Spring about <HI>Augu&s;t:</HI> For in tho&s;e Countries it be|gins then; contrary to our Parts, where the Summer ends at that time. <HI>Maurice</HI> told me, that at the head of the Cape he had found many &s;mall rocky I&s;lands, which lay together very thick as far as a great one that
<PB N="38" REF="31">
lay at the very mouth of the Bay, and de|fended it from the fury of the Waves; he was of opinion that it would prove an ex|cellent Harbour for Ships, if the pa&s;&s;age in|to it was not too difficult, or too &s;hallow for great Ve&s;&s;els by rea&s;on of the many Rocks that lay between the Cape and the great I&s;land which divided and &s;heltered the Bay from the main Ocean.</P>
<P>Well <HI>Maurice,</HI> &s;aid I to him, when we have removed all our Goods and People, and they are &s;ettled in the new Camp, we &s;hall have time enough to di&s;cover tho&s;e I&s;lands, and I will leave the di&s;covery of them to your care and indu&s;try.</P>
<P>In le&s;s than twelve days after the fir&s;t di&s;|covery of the Vale we had tran&s;ported all our People and Goods from the old Camp to the new, which in my ab&s;ence <HI>Van de Nuits</HI> and other Officers named <HI>Sidenberge.</HI> That name obtained &s;o in two or three days time that it was impo&s;&s;ible afterwards to change it. Our men, partly by my order, or of their own accords, made &s;everal good Huts along the Brook &s;ide upon a piece of Ground al|mo&s;t a Mile long, which abutted to the Bay on the Ea&s;t &s;ide of the Cape. Wood we had plenty enough upon the place, and our Fi|&s;hermen took &s;o much Fi&s;h in the Bay that
<PB N="39" REF="31">
we knew not what to do with it for want of &s;alt to &s;ea&s;on or &s;moak it. But <HI>Maurice</HI> quick|ly &s;upplied us with that, for being gone up|on &s;ome of tho&s;e Rocks which lay at the mouth of the Bay, he found there as much of it as would &s;erve the whole Company twenty years if we &s;hould be &s;o long in that place</P>
<P>That Salt was naturally made by the wa|ter of the Sea, which in great &s;torms being &s;lung upon tho&s;e Rocks, filled &s;ome hollow places in them, where the heat of the Sun did afterwards turn it into Salt. There were every day great Parties &s;ent into the Woods to di&s;cover and hunt the Deer, of which many Herds were found up and down, and many of them killed by our men. We &s;aw every day multitudes of Water-fowl fly over the Bay, which made us judge that they had &s;ome particular haunt there. <HI>Maurice</HI> with his new Pinnace and his Longboat ventured every day further and further into the Bay, and in the I&s;lands, and made &s;eve|ral good di&s;coveries. He found a place near the great I&s;land where grew abundance of Reeds and Ru&s;hes, and thither it was that an infinite number of Sea-fowl of al &s;orts did repair. He found another place where there came many green Turtles to lay their Eggs
<PB N="40" REF="32">
upon the Sand, from whence we might draw the greate&s;t part of our &s;ub&s;i&s;tance. In fine, we found &s;o many things to &s;hift withal that we were certain never to want Victuals if we &s;hould live there a thou&s;and years. The greate&s;t want we were &s;en&s;ible of was that of Powder, for though we had &s;aved a good quantity of it, yet that was a thing that would be con&s;umed every day, and that we did not know how to get again when our &s;tock was &s;pent. We fore&s;aw likewi&s;e that our Cloaths, Hooks, and Ve&s;&s;els would in a &s;hort time be worn out if our friends, that were gone in the Pinnace for <HI>Batavia,</HI> &s;hould be lo&s;t, and no relief &s;ent us. But we had already &s;o many experiments of Gods mercy towards us, that we hoped he would not for|&s;ake us.</P>
<P>The Spring came on apace, and we laid up every day new Victuals, by the means of which we &s;aved the Ships Provi&s;ion as much as we could, and chiefly &s;ome Casks of Pea&s;e, and other kind of Pul&s;e we had brought from <HI>Europe.</HI> It came in my head to &s;ow &s;ome of the&s;e in the ground, and having told &s;ome of my Officers of my de&s;ign, they all readily agreed to it. In order to it, we felled a great many Trees above and below the Camp, and having cleared the ground of
<PB N="41" REF="32">
all bu&s;hes and underwood, which we burned upon the place, we made &s;everal furrows in the ground, and &s;owed our Pea&s;e in them, covered them carefully with the earth we had taken up, recommending our endeavours to him that gives the in|crea&s;e.</P>
<P>Some of our Hunt&s;men venturing far in the Wood killed abundance of Game, and not being able to carry it all with them, they hanged two Deer upon an old and thick Tree with an intent to fetch them home the next day. But when &s;even of them came to the place the day following, they &s;aw upon the Tree a great Tiger gnawing on the dead Deer before that terrible Creature percei|ved our men, which I &s;uppo&s;e was occa&s;ion|ed through his hunger, which made him &s;o eager about his meat that he minded nothing el&s;e. Our People were much &s;urpri&s;ed at the &s;ight, and &s;tood &s;till behind &s;ome Trees, and two of them, having cocked their Guns, well charged with Bullets, they aimed, and &s;hot a him both at one time, and fetched him down the Tree. The Tiger made a hi|deous Cry when he fell, but being &s;hot in two places through the body he died imme|diately; they &s;tripped him of his &s;potted skin, and taking down the dead Deer brought
<PB N="42" REF="33">
them in triumph into the Camp. I was glad of their &s;ucce&s;s, but yet new fears came up|on me upon that &s;ubject; for I judged, that &s;ince they had found this mighty Creature in the Forre&s;t, there might be a great many more in it, which at &s;ome time or other might come to our Camp, and fall upon our People unawares.</P>
<P>I &s;ugge&s;ted this to the Council, and it was re&s;olved, That without any delay we &s;hould make a &s;trong Pallizado about our Hutts. We fell to work the next morning, and in le&s;s than ten days after we had empa|led our Camp on all &s;ides, &s;o as to be &s;ecure from any &s;udden inva&s;ion of Men or Bea&s;ts. Our Hunt&s;men al&s;o became a little more cau|tious than before, and did not dare to &s;traggle in the Woods lea&s;t they &s;hould meet any of tho&s;e dreadful Creatures.</P>
<P>It was now &s;even weeks &s;ince we were ca&s;t away, and hitherto we had had no &s;trife nor quarrel among us &s;o long as we lay in fear and danger: But as &s;oon as we thought our &s;elves &s;ecure from men, bea&s;ts, thir&s;t, and hunger, when we fed plentifully upon fre&s;h meat and Fi&s;h, and we did not labour &s;o much as before, then our People be|gan to be wanton. We had a great many Women among us, of which I hitherto for|bore
<PB N="43" REF="33">
to &s;peak, becau&s;e I &s;aw no great occa|&s;ion for it. But now that they began to act their part, and &s;tir up trouble among us, I mu&s;t a little &s;peak of them.</P>
<P>Some of them were poor women, who compelled by Poverty, and their hopes of Preferment, were per&s;waded to go to the <HI>Indies.</HI> Some had their Husbands there, or other Relations, but mo&s;t of them were Whores taken out of Bawdy hou&s;es, or &s;pi|rited away by Fellows, who &s;old them to the Ma&s;ter for a little money, notwith&s;tanding the puni&s;hment ordained by the Laws again&s;t &s;uch practices. The&s;e Whores &s;eeing them&s;elves at re&s;t, and the men idle for the mo&s;t part, began to &s;mile at them, and by amorous &s;peeches to draw &s;ome of them to them&s;elves; they found many &s;o well di&s;|po&s;ed that they needed no &s;pur to be put on, &s;o they would &s;ometimes come together in the night, and enjoy one another in the be&s;t manner they could. But as we lay altogether in a little Camp, and that there was a Guard kept in the night, they could not meet &s;o &s;ecretly but &s;ome body or other would di&s;co|ver them and become a &s;harer in the prey. The&s;e practices did often occa&s;ion quarrels, and jealou&s;ies, which at la&s;t came to blows, but chiefly upon this particular occa&s;ion.</P>
<P><PB N="44" REF="34">
Two young Fellows lay both with one woman, and did not know one of the other; once &s;he appointed a meeting to one of them in the night, and the other coming to her a while after, and reque&s;ting the like favour that very night, &s;he denied him, and put him off upon frivolous pretences. The Fel|low being &s;ubtil, and of a jealous di&s;po&s;i|tion, &s;u&s;pected &s;omething of the truth, and re&s;olved &s;o narrowly to watch her that he would find the true rea&s;on of her denial; he did it accordingly, and caught the Wench with her other Gallant in the fact, the &s;ight whereof did &s;o move his anger, that he drew his Sword and &s;tuck them both in the ground, and then &s;lunk away without being &s;een.</P>
<P>The unfortunate Couple cried out, and were found in that po&s;ture, fir&s;t, by the next Sentinel, and then by the whole Guard, who having taken the Sword out of their bodies, and out of the ground, into which it was run above a foot (&s;uch was the &s;trength and rage of this jealous Lover) carried them to the Chirurgeon, who pre&s;ently dre&s;&s;ed their wounds, then came to me to give me an account of the bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>The next day I a&s;&s;embled the Council to advi&s;e what &s;hould be done about this horrid
<PB N="45" REF="34">
fact, but we knew not whom to accu&s;e. We examined every body that could be &s;u&s;pected; we asked the wounded man, Whether he had any enemies which he could him&s;elf &s;u&s;pect? He an&s;wered, That as he had neither wronged nor di&s;obliged any body of the Company, &s;o he could not fa&s;ten any &s;u&s;pition upon any man. We examined the Wench, but &s;he would accu&s;e no body, although &s;he &s;u&s;pected, and it may be knew the Author of the Crime; but knowing that it was a ju&s;t indignation and exce&s;s of Love that had moved her other Lover to take that revenge, &s;he was &s;o ge|nerous as not to accu&s;e or mention him in the lea&s;t.</P>
<P>This put us into a great perplexity, and we did not know by what ways or means we &s;hould find out the Criminal, when at la&s;t it came into our thoughts to draw out our men into the Fields, and &s;ee which of them wanted his Sword, for no body would own that which had been found in the un|happy Couples bodies. When they were all drawn up, we called every one of them ac|cording to the order of the Li&s;t, and found out the Fellow by the want of his Sword. He was immediately apprehended, and brought to his trial. We asked him, What
<PB N="46" REF="35">
was the rea&s;on he was come into the field without his Sword? To which he an&s;wered boldly, He came without becau&s;e he had none. Had you never any in this Camp, &s;aid I to him? Yes Sir, I had one Ye&s;terday. What have you done with it? I lent it la&s;t night to one who was to go to Sea this morn|ing (for it was true, that a Party of <HI>Maurice</HI> his men were gone early in the morning to &s;ome of the I&s;lands.) Then we asked him, What the mans name was he lent his Sword to? I do not know his name, &s;aid he, although I lent him my Sword, and did &s;ometimes conver&s;e with him, as I do in|differently with any one in this Camp, where I know every one by his face, although I am ignorant of the names of mo&s;t men in the Company, and I do think that it is the ca&s;e of every man here as well as mine. Then I asked him, Whether he was a Seaman or a Pa&s;&s;enger he lent his Sword to? He was a Seaman, and told me, he had lo&s;t his own Sword when he borrowed mine; and be|cau&s;e he would not have it known that he had lo&s;t his Weapon, he intreated me to let him have mine upon his urgent occa&s;ian. Then did we &s;end for the Sword with which the fact had been committed, and asked him, Whether he knew that Sword?
<PB N="47" REF="35">
He readily an&s;wered, He might very well know it, &s;ince he had wore it ever &s;ince I trained up all the men of the Camp into a Military Di&s;cipline, whereof him&s;elf was one. Sir, &s;aith he, This is my Sword, and the very &s;ame I lent la&s;t night to him that borrowed it of me. How came this Sword to be found in the bodies of the two wounded per&s;ons if your hands did not thru&s;t it through them?</P>
<P>And plea&s;e you General, it doth not fol|low that I thru&s;t it into their bodies becau&s;e it is my Sword, he that had it of me might u&s;e it to commit that cruelty in&s;tead of u&s;ing his own, thereby to &s;hake off all &s;u&s;pition from him&s;elf, and lay the guilt on me. I confe&s;s that there are many apparent Argu|ments again&s;t my Innocency, but I am &s;ure there is no evident proof, and I hope you will never find any. After this &s;trict exami|nation, finding we could not convince this Fellow till <HI>Maurices</HI> Crew were come from Sea, we deferred his trial until another time.</P>
<P>But it fell out by fortune that the men of the Boat being upon one of the Sandy I&s;lands where they turn Tortoi&s;es, and &s;ome of them having a mind to &s;wim, went into the Sea to wa&s;h and cool them&s;elves in
<PB N="48" REF="36">
that Element; and as &s;ome were more for|ward than others, a great Shark &s;napped the forwarde&s;t of the Company, who being warned by that dreadful example, got out of the water with all the ha&s;t po&s;&s;ible. The Story of this fatal accident, as likewi&s;e the de|&s;cription of the per&s;on who had been devou|red, came to the knowledge of the Pri&s;oner we had examined, before we could bring him to a &s;econd trial. When he was tried again, he cunningly catching hold on the opportunity, &s;aid confidently, That he had lent his Sword to him who was devoured, of who&s;e Face and Per&s;on he made a very exact de&s;cription in our pre&s;ence. So that we could not do any good, nor bring any evi|dent proof again&s;t him. We all admired his confidence and &s;ubtilty, and hearing that the wounded per&s;ons were like to be well again, we were contented to keep him in bonds till they were both out of danger. The woman was &s;oone&s;t well, and here you may admire the humour of &s;ome of that Sex. As &s;oon as &s;he was cured &s;he came to the young man who had wounded her, and expre&s;&s;ed the greate&s;t love to him that can be imagined, under pretence that &s;he had been the cau&s;e of all his trouble. But I think the true rea|&s;on was, that &s;he looked upon this Fellow
<PB N="49" REF="36">
as a man well in his body, having never been wounded, and who con&s;equently was far more vigorous than her other Gallant, who had lately received a large wound through the body.</P>
<P>This accident occa&s;ioned new Laws, and new Cu&s;toms. We con&s;idered, that as long as we had Women among us they would be the occa&s;ion of trouble and mi&s;chief if we did not betimes take &s;ome good cour&s;e, and allow our men the liberty of u&s;ing them &s;ometimes in an orderly manner. But we had but &s;eventy four women, and above three hundred men, and therefore could not give every man a Wife. We con&s;ulted long upon a Method, and at la&s;t pitched up|on this, We allowed the principal Officers each of them one woman wholly for him|&s;elf, with the priviledge of chu&s;ing accord|ing to his rank. The re&s;t we di&s;tributed into &s;everal divi&s;ions, and ordered it &s;o, that every man, who was not pa&s;t fifty years of Age, might have his woman-bedfellow eve|ry fifth night; we laid a&s;ide the old men, and the four Wives that were going to their Husbands in <HI>Batavia,</HI> and who profe&s;&s;ed to be very cha&s;te and hone&s;t. The&s;e kept toge|ther, and lived a while very re&s;erved, but when they &s;aw that all the other women lay
<PB N="50" REF="37">
freely every night with a man without in|curring any blame, and that the relief we expected from <HI>Batavia</HI> was long a coming, they began to grow melancholy, and to re|pent that they had cho&s;en cha&s;tity for their &s;hare, by which means they were deprived alone of tho&s;e delights and plea&s;ures which they &s;aw all the other women take &s;o freely and &s;o plentifully. They &s;hewed their di&s;|contented minds by a hundred actions, and they nor we were never quiet till we had di|&s;tributed them among the re&s;t, and then they were &s;atisfied. Here we had a very great proof that multiplicity of men to one woman is no friend to Generation, for few of the&s;e women, who were common to five men, proved with Child; and on the con|trary, all tho&s;e who lay but with one man pre&s;ently got a great belly. I think that is the natural rea&s;on why multiplicity of Husbands was never allowed in any Nation, although Poligamy of Wives and Concubines was ever u&s;ed, and is &s;till practi&s;ed in mo&s;t Coun|tries.</P>
<P>Now the time was come that we were to &s;et up the Signal we agreed upon with the eight men of the fir&s;t Pinnace &s;ent to <HI>Bata|via.</HI> I therefore commanded our men to chu&s;e in the Forre&s;t a tall and &s;treight tree to
<PB N="51" REF="37">
&s;et it up at the head of the Cape with a white Sail the large&s;t we had, which was done accordingly. I commanded al&s;o a great fire to be made every night at the &s;ame place, that the Ships &s;ent to our relief might &s;ee it in the dark, and take their aim by that. We were in good hopes that the Pinnace was got to <HI>Batavia</HI> without any great difficulty, con&s;idering the good weather we had had, and that the General would &s;end us relief with all the diligence po&s;&s;ible. But God it &s;eems had ordered it otherwi&s;e, for the wea|ther, which for almo&s;t two months had been fair, began to grow rainy, and &s;tormy, &s;o that we &s;aw almo&s;t every day great tem|pe&s;ts in the Ocean, although our Bay was not much agitated by them by rea&s;on of the high ground, and the many little I&s;lands that &s;heltered it from the violence of the Winds and Waves. It rained almo&s;t every day for a fortnight together, but the Sun &s;hined hot every day al&s;o, &s;o that we had a mixture of Rain, Wind, and Sun&s;hine at the &s;ame time. It was well that we had been provident in powdring and &s;moaking of meat and fi&s;h, which we laid up in great &s;tore in the empty Casks we had brought from our Ships, for if we had not done &s;o, we might have wanted Victuals while this
<PB N="52" REF="38">
bad weather la&s;ted, which was above a fort|night. It grew a little better after that &s;pace of time, but not &s;o good but we had Winds, Rains, and Storms at Sea; then &s;udden calms, at the lea&s;t once or twice a week, which made us de&s;pair of ever hearing from <HI>Batavia,</HI> and made us re&s;olve to provide for our &s;elves there, without depending upon any relief from thence.</P>
<P>The weather grew very hot, and &s;ince the rain fell all things were vi&s;ibly grown in the fields, and our Pea&s;e did thrive the be&s;t that ever I &s;aw, &s;o we were like to have a great Crop of them, which encouraged, us to break more ground, and to &s;ow a great ma|ny more. There was an infinite of Fi&s;h and Fowl in the Bay, and upon a calm day we could take as many of them as we plea&s;ed; but our Nets began to wear out, and we were forced to tear &s;ome of our Cables to make new Nets of them, which we made a &s;hift with for a great while, nece&s;&s;ity being the mother of Arts.</P>
<P>Our Hunt&s;men had made &s;uch a noi&s;e in the Wood near the Camp, and &s;o cha&s;ed the Dear, that they were quite gone from that part, and none could be &s;een ten miles about us. That made them re&s;olve to take another cour&s;e, and to go by water to the other &s;ide
<PB N="53" REF="38">
of the Bay, or to the bottom of it, where we &s;aw Wood all round. <HI>Maurice</HI> was fir&s;t ordered to make di&s;coveries on the other &s;ide; which he did, and found there were great Woods there, and a little River that ran into the Bay. He rowed four or five miles up that River and &s;aw nothing but Trees, and &s;ome mar&s;hy ground along the bank of it, yet we &s;uppo&s;ed there would be many Deer found on that &s;ide if we &s;hould put it to a trial. In order to which, fifty of our men having taken Victuals and Ammu|nition for a Week, went to the Banks of that River in the Pinnace, and the Long|boat, and having Landed there, made them|&s;elves Huts, keeping the Long-boat with them to u&s;e it according to their occa&s;ion, and &s;ending the Pinnace back again. A while after being gone into the Forre&s;t to &s;eek for Deer, they found great Herds of them, whereof they made a great &s;laughter; they likewi&s;e found a kind of Bea&s;t like a Swine, but bigger, and &s;lower in his pace, and u&s;ing to go a rooting in the Woods in great num|bers; they killed fir&s;t one of them, vvhich upon examination proved far better meat than any of our European Pork.</P>
<P><HI>Maurice</HI> being de&s;irous to di&s;cover the great I&s;land that lay at the mouth of the
<PB N="54" REF="39">
Bay, landed there with twenty men; the fir&s;t part of it that lay inwardly he found to be but Stony and Rocky places, but when they were gone a little beyond, they found it to be a pretty big I&s;land, con&s;i&s;ting for the mo&s;t part of moori&s;h ground, which being almo&s;t dreined by the heat of the Summer was turned into very good Pa&s;ture ground; they found hundreds of Deer feeding upon it, and abundance of Fowl of all kind, &s;o tame that they would let a man come within a yard or two of them, they marched to the Ea&s;t|ward of the place, and found that this Land was divided from the continent by a narrow Channel only; it was found afterward that in the Spring time the Deer &s;wam from the Continent to the I&s;land, which I&s;land was not above twelve miles Diameter. The&s;e new di&s;coveries being &s;o happy filled our hearts with joy, and a certain a&s;&s;urance we &s;hould not want for Victuals if we were ten times as many, and made us bold to venture farther.</P>
<P><HI>Maurice</HI> had ob&s;erved that the Bay ran a great way in length towards the Southea&s;t, and &s;uppo&s;ed there was &s;ome great River that flowed from that &s;ide of the Country into the Sea, which was not unlikely. He therefore, having obtained leave to take a
<PB N="55" REF="39">
Weeks Provi&s;ion, and a &s;ufficient number of men, &s;ailed that way with a re&s;olution to go as far as he could with his Pinnace, and we having prayed for his good &s;ucce&s;s minded our other concerns, in hopes of his happy return.</P>
<P>By this time our Pea&s;e were almo&s;t ripe, and nine or ten days after we had a mo&s;t prodigious Crop of them, every Peck yield|ing above a hundred, which is almo&s;t incre|dible; and we expected another Crop that promi&s;ed no le&s;s than this if it &s;hould come to perfection. We dried them carefully, and laid them up in &s;tore for the Winter and &s;o we did with every thing that would keep, u&s;ing for the pre&s;ent &s;uch as could not be pre|&s;erved.</P>
<P>It was above a quarter of a year &s;ince we were &s;etled at <HI>Sidenberg,</HI> and having heard nothing from <HI>Batavia,</HI> we concluded our Pinnace was peri&s;hed, and gave it over for lo&s;t; but our greate&s;t trouble was, that above ten days were pa&s;t &s;ince <HI>Maurice</HI> was gone and we heard no tidings of him: This ca&s;t a general &s;orrow upon our hearts, and in that great affliction we did not know what Coun&s;el to take, we dur&s;t not &s;end the Long|boat in &s;earch of him for fear &s;he &s;hould be lo&s;t, knowing that without our Ve&s;&s;els
<PB N="56" REF="40">
we could hardly be able to &s;ub&s;i&s;t.</P>
<P>Our Hunt&s;men had made a kind of a new Plantation on the other &s;ide of the Bay for conveniency of hunting, and without our Boats we could keep no commerce with them. All the&s;e reflections, and the fear of wor&s;e accidents increa&s;ed our affliction throughout all the Camp, where we lay la|menting the lo&s;s of our Pinnaces above a fortnight before we could hear any thing of either of them. <HI>Maurice</HI> did not come, and we did not know what to think of him and his Ve&s;&s;el, knowing there had been no great &s;torms &s;ince &s;he was gone, and that being in &s;o calm a Sea &s;he could not have peri&s;hed by Tempe&s;ts. We did not think neither that &s;he was fallen into the hands of Enemies or Pyrates, having rea&s;on to believe from our former experience that there were no men in tho&s;e parts.</P>
<P>Wavering &s;o betwixt hope and fears, up|on a calm day we &s;aw <HI>Maurices</HI> Pinnace and two Ve&s;&s;els more coming along with him towards us. While we were looking upon them, wondring how he came by the&s;e two Ve&s;&s;els, and what they might be, We &s;pied ten Sails more at a good di&s;tance coming af|ter them. This unexpected Fleet put our Camp into a great apprehen&s;ion. We ran
<PB N="57" REF="40">
all to our Arms, prepared our Cannons for our defence, and &s;ent Scouts towards the &s;hore to ob&s;erve the motions of this Fleet. In the mean while they drew near to the &s;hore, and at Musket &s;hot they all ca&s;t An|chor in good order; but <HI>Maurices</HI> Pinnace came very near, &s;o that we could &s;ee him and his men from the &s;hore, and hear him plainly &s;peak to us. He bid us not be afraid, and de&s;ired us to &s;end the Boat with three men only to fetch him a&s;hore; after &s;ome conte&s;tation we &s;ent the Boat, which being come aboard him he leapt into it with one of his men, and took down with him a tall and grave Per&s;onage in a black Gown, a Hat on his head, and a white Flag in his hand, and &s;o came a&s;hore to us.</P>
<P>I, with &s;ome of my Officers, &s;tood at &s;ome di&s;tance, but when we &s;aw this man landed we went to meet him. <HI>Maurice</HI> told us in few words, That he was &s;ent from the Governour of a City &s;ituate about &s;ixty miles above the Bay, where we had received all the kindne&s;s and civility imaginable, and de&s;ired us withal to expre&s;s all manner of re&s;pect to him. Upon that advice we did bow to him in very humble and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive manner, which he received with a great deal of gravity and mildne&s;s, and &s;tretching
<PB N="58" REF="41">
his right hand towards Heaven, &s;aid in very good Dutch.</P>
<Q>The Eternal God of the World ble&s;s you, the Sun his great Mini&s;ter, and our glorious King, &s;hine kindly upon you, and this our Land be fortunate to you.</Q>
<P>After this, <HI>Maurice</HI> having told him that I was the General, he gave me his hand, which I humbly ki&s;t, and he took me about the neck and ki&s;&s;ed me in the middle of the forehead, and then de&s;ired to march to our Camp, where we received him in the be&s;t manner we could. He looked upon our Huts and Pallizadoes, and nodded his head in &s;ign that he liked it very well; then &s;pake thus to me:</P>
<Q><HI>Sir, I have heard the Hi&s;tory of your di&s;|a&s;ter, and knowing of your merits and Gallan|try, I have made no difficulty of putting my Per&s;on into your hands; but that I may not keep you any longer from the Relation your Officer</HI> Maurice <HI>will make unto you of what hath hapned unto him &s;ince his departure from hence; I de&s;ire to re&s;t a little in your Hut while you &s;a|tisfie your curio&s;ity, and hear tho&s;e things which will be nece&s;&s;ary for you to be acquainted with, and that I hope will &s;et your minds at re&s;t.</HI></Q>
<P><PB N="59" REF="41">
We made no an&s;wer, but making a low reverence left him in the Hut, and went to <HI>Maurice,</HI> who expected our coming in <HI>Van de Nuits</HI> Hut. We were no &s;ooner with him but we began to ask him que&s;tions concern|ing his journey; and he having begged our leave and favourable audience &s;pake to us in this manner:</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="speech">
<HEAD>Maurices Speech.</HEAD>
<P><Q>NOble General, and worthy Officers, with your leave, and even with your Command, I departed from this place about three Weeks ago, with a de&s;ign to make further di&s;coveries in the Bay. The fir&s;t day I &s;ailed to the Southea&s;t of it above twenty miles, and &s;aw nothing on either &s;ide but great Woods as you &s;ee here, di&s;tant one from another five or &s;ix miles at the lea&s;t. At night we ca&s;t Anchor at a mile di&s;tance from the right &s;ide of the river, and lay there till next morning. From thence with Wind and Tide we &s;ailed up further to the Southea&s;t about five Miles more, and there we found the Banks on each &s;ide of the River came near one to another, within two miles di&s;tance. We &s;ailed up
<PB N="60" REF="42">
&s;till, though with a little more difficulty, till we came into abroad place, where the water &s;preads it &s;elf into a great Lake, from the middle of which we could hard|ly &s;ee the &s;hore on either &s;ide; we only &s;aw ten or twelve &s;mall I&s;lands di&s;per&s;ed up and down the Lake, and mo&s;t of them &s;haded with tall green trees, very delight|ful to the Eyes. By this time the Wind was &s;omewhat altered, and the Lake was &s;o calm that we could hardly perceive any motion in it; but as the place was wide we rid to and fro as the Wind did &s;erve, not much caring which &s;ide of the Lake we &s;hould go fir&s;t to, yet when the Wind would &s;erve we endeavoured as much as we could to make to the Southea&s;t. About Evening we had a fine breeze, which drove us to the Southea&s;t according to our wi&s;hes, and that night we ca&s;t Anchor be|twixt two or three of tho&s;e &s;mall I&s;lands, not above two or three miles di&s;tant one from the other, with an intent to vi&s;it them the day following. We lay at Anchor all night, and took our re&s;t without any care or fear, not thinking there had been any In|habitants in tho&s;e places, but we found we were much deceived, for as &s;oon as it was broad light we &s;aw about us ten or twelve
<PB N="61" REF="42">
Ve&s;&s;els, which did &s;o encompa&s;s us about, that we could go no way but we mu&s;t fall among them. This &s;truck a great terrour upon us, and we thought verily vve &s;hould all be killed or taken, for vve had but one of the&s;e vvays to chu&s;e, to fight, or to &s;urrender our &s;elves, and lie at the mercy of unknovvn men, vvho might u&s;e any cruelty upon us. This la&s;t con&s;iderati|on prevailed, and made us all re&s;olve to fight it out to the la&s;t man; &s;o vve all ran to our Arms, prepared our Guns, and vvere very vvell re&s;olved to defend our lives, for vve could not run avvay, the vveather being very &s;till, and the men vve &s;avv about us having &s;everal Shallops vvell manned vvith Rovvers, vvho rovved to|vvards us vvith great &s;vviftne&s;s.

We &s;tood to our Arms, and let that Ve&s;|&s;el come on to us, knovving it vvas not &s;trong enough alone to attempt any thing again&s;t our Pinnace. When they vvere come vvithin fifteen or tvventy yards of us the man vvho had the vvhite Flag in his
<PB N="62" REF="43">
hand, making a low reverence, &s;pake to us in Spani&s;h, and bad us not be afraid, for no harm was intended again&s;t us. One of my men, who could &s;peak that Language, explained what he &s;aid, and asked him why they came &s;o about us? He an&s;wered, It was the cu&s;tom of the place, that we &s;hould come to no harm, and de&s;ired to know what Countrimen we were. He told him we were <HI>Hollanders.</HI> Then he replied in Dutch, That we were welcome into the Country, and de&s;ired to be admitted into our Pinnace him&s;elf and another man of his Company only, prof|fering to remain with us as Ho&s;tages till matters were better under&s;tood. We rea|dily yielded unto his de&s;ire, &s;o they came aboard us. He was a very lu&s;ty man, with a manly look, wearing a red Gown down to the middle of his Legs, with a Cap of the &s;ame colour, and a Sha&s;h about his wa&s;te, much after the Garb we paint Car|dinals in. The other man was in the like habit, and a lu&s;ty man too, both about forty years of Age. When he was come up to us he asked who was the Commander of the Pinnace; and having been told I was the Per&s;on, he came to me in a kind and civil manner embraced me, and bid us
<PB N="63" REF="43">
all welcome into the Country. Then he asked how we came into tho&s;e parts in &s;o &s;mall a Ve&s;&s;el. I an&s;wered, That we came in a bigger, but that &s;he was ca&s;t away up|on the Coa&s;ts, and that out of her Ruines we had made this Pinnace. Then he asked me if we were all that were &s;aved? I told him it was &s;o, and that the re&s;t of our Com|pany were drowned (for I did not think it fit to &s;peak of our People in the Camp un|til we were better acquainted with the&s;e men, and &s;aw what u&s;age we &s;hould have among&s;t them.) He altering his Counte|nance, as if he had been &s;orry for our lo&s;s, told us he took great part in our affliction. Then did he ask me &s;everal que&s;tions con|cerning our Voyage, our Shipwrack, and the pre&s;ent &s;tate of <HI>Europe.</HI> To which I returned &s;uch an&s;wers as I thought conve|nient. He &s;eemed to be well plea&s;ed with my an&s;wers, and told us we were come in|to a Country where we &s;hould find more kindne&s;s and civility than we could in our own, and where we &s;hould want none of tho&s;e things that are capable to make mode|rate men happy. We returned him humble thanks, and de&s;ired to know what the name of the Country was? He told us it was called in their Language <HI>Sporumb&egrave;,</HI> the
<PB N="64" REF="44">
Inhabitants <HI>Sporui;</HI> that it belonged to a greater and happier Country beyond the Hills, called <HI>Sevaramb&egrave;,</HI> and the people <HI>evarambi,</HI> who lived in a great City called <HI>Sevarinde.</HI> That we were not above four|teen Miles from another City (but much le&s;s than the fir&s;t) called <HI>Sporunde</HI> where he intended to carry us. Then perceiving &s;ome alteration in our faces cau&s;ed by his la&s;t words, he proceeded in this manner:</Q></P>
<P><Q>Gentlemen, I told you at fir&s;t you &s;hould not be afraid, for no harm will be done you I a&s;&s;ure you, unle&s;s you will draw it upon your &s;elves through your di&s;tru&s;t and &s;tubbornne&s;s. Your be&s;t way is to rely upon Gods Providence, and the a&s;&s;urances I give you, that no wrong &s;hall be done to the lea&s;t of you either in his per&s;on or his goods. You are but a &s;mall number of men in a little Pinnace, in a &s;trange Country, de&s;titute of all things, and no way able to defend your &s;elves again&s;t our Ve&s;&s;els which are many again&s;t one, and full of men, who no le&s;s under&s;tand how to fight than you, as you will find if you put it to a trial. They are no Barbarians as you may ima|gine, but a very good charitable and civil people. So con&s;ider what is be&s;t for you to do. As &s;oon as he had &s;poken tho&s;e words,
<PB N="65" REF="44">
he and his Companion went to one end of the Pinnace as it were to give us an oppor|tunity to con&s;ult among our &s;elves, which we did, and pre&s;ently re&s;olved to follow his directions, and to tru&s;t to Providence. He, perceiving we intended to go to him, came him&s;elf to us, and asked what cour&s;e we were re&s;olved to take? We intend to obey your Commands in every thing, Sir, and think our &s;elves happy to be under your protection; We are poor di&s;tre&s;&s;ed men, fitter Objects for pity than for anger, and we hope to find Mercy and help at your hands. You will find it in a great mea&s;ure, and &s;ee in the&s;e Countries &s;uch wonders as are not to be &s;een in any other part of the World. Then he made &s;ign to his Shallop to come near, which they did immediately. They brought us Bread, Wine, dry Dates, Rai&s;ins, Figs, and &s;everal &s;orts of Nuts, of which we made an excellent Fea&s;t, and drank merrily of the delicate Wines that were given us. After this welcom Meal, the man told me his name was <HI>Car&s;hid&agrave;,</HI> his Companion's <HI>Beno&s;car,</HI> and de&s;ired to know mine. I told him my name was <HI>Maurice,</HI> and asked him withal how he came to &s;peak <HI>Dutch</HI> and <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> in &s;o re|mote a Country. I will &s;atisfie you herein

another time <HI>Maurice,</HI> (&s;aid he) in the mean while we mu&s;t give order for our go|ing to <HI>Sporund&egrave;,</HI> that we may be there to day before night.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Then did he &s;peak to his men in his own Language, and they made &s;ign to another Ve&s;&s;el that &s;tood near to come to us, they pre&s;ently came, and having tied a rope to our Pinnace, towed her up the Lake to the Southea&s;t of it, the other Ve&s;&s;el rowing af|ter us; in that manner we left the little I&s;land and the Fleet (which did not &s;tir from their Station &s;o long as we were in &s;ight of them) and rowed till two in the afternoon through that great Lake of &s;alt water, which looks more like a Sea than like a Lake. About that time we had a gen|tle breeze, which carried us in le&s;s than two hours clear out of the Lake into a River, where we found &s;weet water, and &s;aw a fine Champain Country on each &s;ide of it. We had not &s;ailed two miles in this River but we came to a pretty narrow place, where the water is kept in by two great and thick Walls, and &s;aw all along near the&s;e Walls great Buildings of Brick and Stone mixed together, and built after the manner of a Ca&s;tle in a perfect Quadrangle. We went two miles further up along the&s;e Walls
<PB N="67" REF="45">
and Buildings before we came to the Ci|ty of <HI>Sporund&egrave;,</HI> which &s;tands in the con|fluence of two great Rivers, in a fine de|licate Plain, diver&s;ified with Corn-fields, Meadows, Orchards, Gardens, and Groves, which make it very delightful to the eye; the &s;mall Ve&s;&s;el, which at fir&s;t came after us, was gone up a good while before we came to the Town, to give them warning of our coming. We rowed up to a great and &s;tately Key, where &s;tood a great mul|titude of People, who came out to &s;ee us Land. <HI>Car&s;hid&agrave;</HI> went on &s;hore fir&s;t, where he was received by &s;ome grave men in black, with whom having di&s;cour&s;ed a while, he turned him&s;elf towards us, and made &s;igns to <HI>Beno&s;car</HI> to bring us a&s;hore. He in a few vvords told us vvhat vve vvere to do, and bid us to follovv him. We vvent up the Stairs of the Key, (vvhich vvas pretty high) and being come to the place vvhere the grave men &s;tood, vve inclined our &s;elves down to the ground three &s;everal times. The men bowed a little to us, and the chiefe&s;t of them taking me in his Arms, very kindly embraced me, ki&s;&s;ed me in the fore|head, and bade us all vvelcom to <HI>Sporund&egrave;.</HI> From that place they carried us through a &s;tately Gate, and a noble Street as &s;treight
<PB N="68" REF="46">
as a Line, to a great &s;quare building after the manner above&s;aid. We vvent into it through a large gate that &s;tood in the mid|dle of the Building, and found the inner part of it to be like Cloy&s;ters vvith large Galleries on all &s;ides, and a large Green in the middle. From thence vve vvere brought into a great Hall, vvhere &s;tood &s;everal Ta|bles and Seats. There the grave men in black &s;tood round me, and asked me &s;eve|ral que&s;tions, much like unto tho&s;e <HI>Car&s;hid&agrave;</HI> had asked me at the fir&s;t, to vvhich I an|&s;vvered in the &s;ame manner. A vvhile after they carried us to another Hall next unto that, vvhere vve found &s;everal Tables full of meat, much after our <HI>European</HI> fa&s;hion. Then <HI>Sermodas</HI> (for that is the name of the grave man vvho is novv in the Generals Hut) asked me vvhether vve had any &s;to|mach to our Supper. To vvhom I made an&s;vver, That it vvas &s;o long &s;ince we had &s;een &s;uch a Supper that I did not think any of us vvould vvant a &s;tomach to eat it. He &s;miled, and taking me by the hand brought me to the chiefe&s;t Table, and made me &s;it next to him; then all the other grave men &s;ate vvith us, and <HI>Car&s;hid&agrave;</HI> with <HI>Be|no&s;car</HI> took all my men to another Table. We had a very noble Supper, after vvhich
<PB N="69" REF="46">
we were carried up into a great Room, where we &s;aw &s;everal Beds upon Iron Bed|&s;teads. There my men were ordered to lye two and two, and I was carried to a Room by my &s;elf, where <HI>Sermodas</HI> and his com|pany wi&s;hed me good night, and &s;o went away. A while after <HI>Car&s;hid&agrave;</HI> came in and told me, that I and my men mu&s;t prepare to appear the next day before <HI>Albicormas,</HI> Governour of <HI>Sporund&egrave;,</HI> and &s;aid he would give us directions how to behave our &s;elves, and &s;o he bid me good night.</Q></P>
<P><Q>The next day about &s;ix of the clock in the morning we heard a great Bell ring, and an hour after <HI>Car&s;hid&agrave;</HI> and <HI>Beno&s;car</HI> came into my Chamber, and asked me how I had taken my re&s;t, and if I wanted any thing? I would have ri&s;en pre&s;ently, but he told me I mu&s;t not, till &s;uch time as I had new Cloaths to put on, which would be brought immediately. Upon that <HI>Be|no&s;car</HI> went out, and came a while after with &s;ome attendance, who brought new Cloaths, both Linnen and Woollen, made after the manner of the Country. Then came in others with a Tub, which they filled with warm water, and then <HI>Car&s;hid&agrave;</HI> told me it was to wa&s;h my body in before I put on my new Cloaths, and &s;o went out
<PB N="70" REF="47">
with all the Company, leaving only a Ser|vant to wait upon me. According to his directions I vva&s;hed, and then put on a fine Cotten Shirt and Dravvers, vvith Stockings of the &s;ame. I had al&s;o a nevv black Hat, nevv Shooes, a Govvn of &s;eve|ral colours, and a black Sha&s;h to put about my middle. As &s;oon as I vvas ready, the Servant, taking my old Cloaths vvith him, vvent out, and then came in again <HI>Car&s;hid&agrave;</HI> and his company, vvho told me that I and all my men vvere to attend <HI>Albicormas</HI> and his Council, and gave me directions hovv to behave my &s;elf. We vvent dovvn into the Yard, vvhere I found all my men in nevv Apparel, much like unto mine, but not altogether &s;o good, and vvearing Caps on their heads in&s;tead of Hats. <HI>Beno&s;car</HI> vvas vvith them, and vvas giving them directions hovv to behave them&s;elves be|fore the Council. We &s;tood there a vvhile looking one upon another, till <HI>Sermodas</HI> and his company came in. He very kindly asked us all hovv vve did, and then, di|recting his &s;peech to me, he asked me vvhe|ther I vvas ready to vvait upon the Coun|cil? I an&s;vvered vve vvere all ready to obey his Commands; vvhich &s;aid, he took me by the hand, and made me march on his
<PB N="71" REF="47">
left &s;ide into the Street. <HI>Car&s;hid&agrave;</HI> put him|&s;elf at the head of my men, vvhich vvere di&s;po&s;ed tvvo and tvvo, and marched in Rank and File like Souldiers, <HI>Beno&s;car</HI> bringing up the Rear.</Q></P>
<P><Q>In that order vve marched through &s;ome Streets till we came to a great place in the middle of the City, and in the Center of this place &s;tood a large and magnificent Palace, of a &s;quare Figure, and built with white Free&s;tone, and black Marble, all &s;o clean, and &s;o well poli&s;hed, that we thought it was new, though we heard after|wards it had been built a good while. In the middle &s;tood a great and &s;tately Gate, adorned with &s;everal brazen Statues, and on each &s;ide thereof two long Files of Mu&s;quetteers, all in blew Gowns. We marched through them into the fir&s;t Court, where we found another Lane of men in red Gowns, with Halberts in their hands. As &s;oon as we were come in, we heard a great &s;ound of many Trumpets, and &s;everal other In&s;truments of War, very &s;weet and plea&s;ant, which &s;ounded all the time we &s;tood in that Yard, for a quarter of an hour. From thence we proceeded into the next Court, all built with well poli&s;hed black Marble, with Nitches round about,
<PB N="72" REF="48">
and delicate Statues in them. In the middle of the Yard &s;tood about a hundred men in black, mo&s;t of them of riper years than tho&s;e we had &s;een in the other Courts. We &s;tood a little in that place, till two grave men (&s;uch as &s;tood in the Court, with on|ly this difference, that they wore a piece of Gold coloured Silk hanging loo&s;e upon their left &s;houlder) came down and bid <HI>Sermodas</HI> bring us all up. We went up in the &s;ame order as we came, upon a &s;tately Stair-ca&s;e, gilt and painted very richly, to a great Hall, gilt and painted in the &s;ame manner, and there we &s;tood a while. From that they brought us into another Hall, richer than the fir&s;t; and then into a third, far beyond either of them. At the end of this Hall we &s;aw a pretty high Throne, and a little lower long Seats on each &s;ide of it. Upon the Throne &s;ate a grave Maje&s;tick Per&s;onage, and upon the other Seats &s;everal venerable men on his right and left. He that &s;ate uppermo&s;t in the mid&s;t of them wore a Purple Gown, and the others were habited like the two men who led us into the place, who were Members of the Council. We were told that he in the Purple Gown was <HI>Albicormas,</HI> and the others the chiefe&s;t Officers of the City,
<PB N="73" REF="48">
who, together with him, govern the whole Country of <HI>Sporumb&egrave;.</HI> At our fir&s;t com|ing into the Hall we made an inclination of our bodies, then being come to the middle of it we bowed a little more, but when we came to a Bali&s;ter or Rail near to the Throne, we bowed down to the very ground, according to the directions given us before. Then &s;tood up all the Coun&s;el|lors and made a &s;mall inclination of their bodies, but <HI>Albicormas</HI> nodded only with his head. Then did <HI>Sermodas</HI> take me by the hand, and brought me as near the Rail as we could go, and bowing down very profoundly &s;pake to <HI>Albicormas,</HI> and gave him partly an account of us in his own Language, as we imagined, and as we were told afterwards. Methoughts their Speech &s;ounded much like the <HI>Greek</HI> or <HI>Latine,</HI> as I have &s;ometimes heard it &s;poken in <HI>Holland,</HI> and ran very &s;mooth and Maje&s;tical. When <HI>Sermodas</HI> had &s;poken a while, <HI>Car&s;hida</HI> was &s;ent for, who gave the Council a full rela|tion of our Affairs, and of the time and manner we came into the Lake, by them called <HI>Spora&s;cump&s;o;</HI> how we were &s;een and taken in it, which was in this manner, as we under&s;tood afterwards.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="74" REF="49">
<Q>The day upon which we came into the Lake was a &s;olemn day in tho&s;e parts, &s;o that all the Inhabitants of the I&s;lands were celebrating the &s;ame, and intent upon their Exerci&s;es and Pa&s;times when we &s;ailed into it, and that was the rea&s;on why we &s;aw no Ve&s;&s;els in it at fir&s;t, although there are &s;everal fi&s;hing there upon other days. But although we &s;aw no body, yet our Pinnace was &s;oon &s;pied from the I&s;lands, &s;o that &s;everal Ve&s;&s;els were &s;ent out in the night to catch us in the morning, and &s;ecure us from going back again without leave. It being the cu&s;tom of tho&s;e People to keep a very &s;trict guard about their Country for fear it &s;hould come to be known to Fo|reigners, who&s;e de&s;igns, and corrupted lives might in time bring trouble to their State, and corruption to their manners, the peace and purity of which two things they are mo&s;t careful to &s;ecure.</Q></P>
<P><Q>When <HI>Car&s;hid&agrave;</HI> had made an end of &s;peaking. <HI>Albicormas</HI> &s;tood up and bid us welcom in his own Language, as <HI>Sermodas</HI> interpreted it unto us. He added, That we &s;hould find all manner of kindne&s;s and good u&s;age among the <HI>Sporui,</HI> and that we &s;hould &s;tay in <HI>Sporund&egrave;</HI> till &s;uch a time as he did receive Orders from <HI>Sevarminas,</HI>
<PB N="75" REF="49">
the Suns Vice-Roy, who lived in the City of <HI>Sevarinde,</HI> whither he would &s;end a Me&s;&s;enger that very day to give him an account of us. That in the mean while we &s;hould enjoy all the comfort and mode|rate plea&s;ure the Country could afford if we would be ruled by <HI>Sermodas</HI> and his Officers, to who&s;e care and conduct he recommend|ed me and all my men, exhorting us to be|have our &s;elves mode&s;tly, and &s;o he di&s;mi&s;|&s;ed us.</Q></P>
<P><Q>I ob&s;erved, that <HI>Albicormas</HI> was very crooked, though he was otherwi&s;e a man of good pre&s;ence, and grave carriage, and &s;o were many of his A&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors; and we found afterwards that among the People there was a great number of deformed per&s;ons mixed with very hand&s;om Folk of all Ages and Sexes; and I was told, That the rea&s;on of it was, that tho&s;e of <HI>Sevarind&egrave;</HI> &s;ent all &s;uch imperfect People as were born among&s;t them to this place, and would not &s;uffer any body who had any deformity of body to live in their Country. I was fur|ther told, That in their Language <HI>Spora</HI> &s;ignified a defective per&s;on, and <HI>Sporund&egrave;</HI> the City of the maimed or defective. Tho&s;e that were incorrigibly vitious, or unquiet, were di&s;po&s;ed of another way, as in the
<PB N="76" REF="50">
&s;equel or continuation of this Hi&s;tory &s;hall hereafter be made appear.</Q></P>
<P><Q>After <HI>Albicormas</HI> had di&s;mi&s;&s;ed us we went back to our Lodging in the &s;ame or|der as we came from it, and found there a very good Dinner provided for us. We kept at home all that Afternoon becau&s;e the weather was hot, but in the Evening <HI>Ser|modas</HI> and <HI>Car&s;hid&agrave;</HI> took us out to &s;hew us the City, and led us from Street to Street, where we found great multitudes of Peo|ple, who came out to look on us. The Town is the mo&s;t regular that ever I &s;aw, being divided into great &s;quare Buildings, which contain every one above a thou&s;and People, &amp; they are built all after the &s;ame manner. There are &s;eventy &s;ix of them, and &s;o many thou&s;ands of Inhabitants in the whole City, which is above four miles about. It &s;tands betwixt two Rivers, as I told you before, but the indu&s;try of that People has made it an I&s;land of a Penin&s;ula, by drawing a great Trench from River to river two miles above the City. This Trench is no le&s;s than three miles long, having a great Wall on each &s;ide and many Bridges over it, very broad and &s;trongly built with large Free-&s;tone, as you may &s;ee your &s;elves when you come to the place.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="77" REF="50">
<Q>At night we had a good Supper, and two hours after we were all carried to a great Hall, where we found fifteen young Wo|men, who waited there for us. They were mo&s;t of them very tall and proper women, in painted Callico Gowns, wearing their black hair in long and thick breads, hanging down upon their Brea&s;ts and Shoulders. We were a little &s;urpri&s;ed to find &s;o many of them in a row, and did much admire at them, not knowing what they &s;tood there for, when <HI>Sermodas</HI> &s;pake to us in this manner:</Q></P>
<P><Q>You wonder <HI>Maurice</HI> to &s;ee here &s;o many proper Women together, and little under|&s;tand the rea&s;on why you find them in this po&s;ture and habit, &s;omewhat different from other womens Dre&s;s. Know you therefore that the&s;e are our &s;laves, and that they are here to wait upon you and your Com|rades. You have your &s;everal Cu&s;toms in <HI>Europe,</HI> and &s;o have other Countries their own. Some are bad and vicious in nature, and others only &s;eem to be good or bad ac|cording to mens prejudices, and appre|hen&s;ions. But there are &s;ome that are grounded upon Rea&s;on, and are truly good in them&s;elves if we rightly con&s;ider them. Ours are for the mo&s;t part, if not all of
<PB N="78" REF="51">
this kind, and we hardly have anyone which is not e&s;tabli&s;hed upon Rea&s;on. You know, I &s;uppo&s;e, that the moderate u&s;e of tho&s;e good things Nature hath appointed for all living Creatures is good, and that there is nothing but the abu&s;e of them, either in the exce&s;s, or in the defect that may be termed bad, provided Faith, Ju&s;tice, and Equity be exactly ob&s;erved</Q></P>
<P><Q>Among tho&s;e good things, we conceive there are two of the greate&s;t importance, <HI>viz.</HI> The pre&s;ervation and happy being of every living Creature, and the propagation of its Species. The means to attain to the fir&s;t are all tho&s;e natural Actions, without which no Creature can &s;ub&s;i&s;t, and &s;uch are Eating, Drinking, Sleeping, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> But her bountiful hands do not only give us tho&s;e things which are meerly nece&s;&s;ary to keep us alive, but al&s;o liberally be&s;tow upon us tho&s;e delights and plea&s;ures, the ju&s;t and moderate u&s;e whereof may make our lives &s;weet and comfortable; and that we may the better take plea&s;ure in them &s;he hath given us an Appetite, and a Palate capable to di&s;cern their various ta&s;tes and qualities according as they are &s;utable to our natures. For the pre&s;ervation of every Species Nature hath likewi&s;e appointed
<PB N="79" REF="51">
that every Male &s;hould be united to a Fe|male, that by their union their kind &s;hould be pre&s;erved, which is her chiefe&s;t end. And that they may be the more inclined to accompli&s;h her noble de&s;ign &s;he hath given them a mutual love and de&s;ire of Conjun|ction, and annexed a plea&s;ure to the actual union of the two Sexes for the pre&s;ervation of the Species, as a plea&s;ure al&s;o in eating, and drinking to every Animal. The&s;e are the Eternal Laws of God in Nature, and the&s;e two ends, together with the plea&s;ure we take in the means, through which we may attain to them, are not only lawful and nece&s;&s;ary, but al&s;o laudible and com|manded. Be&s;ides the&s;e two great con|cerns there is a third one, which hath a general regard to Humane Society, and without which no Kingdom or Common|wealth can well &s;ub&s;it, and that is obedi|ence and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the Government. But every Government ought to be e&s;tabli&s;hed as much upon Natural Rea&s;on as po&s;&s;ibly can be, that every Member of that Society may freely enjoy his natural liberty, and the moderate u&s;e of all tho&s;e good things which Nature hath appointed for the wel|fare of Mankind. For if any Government make tho&s;e good things had and unlawful,
<PB N="80" REF="52">
which in them&s;elves are good and inno|cent, we may conclude that &s;uch Govern|ment is unju&s;t, and contrary to the Eter|nal Laws of God and Natural Rea&s;on. By the&s;e Arguments it appears, that tho&s;e who have not in the&s;e three principal things a due regard to their own per&s;ons, their Po|&s;terity and their Neighbours are cruel to them&s;elves, rebellious to God, and un|worthy to live in any humane Society.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Tho&s;e con&s;iderations induced our great Lawgiver <HI>Sevarias</HI> (who&s;e glorious name and love of his imcomparable vertues &s;hall ever be &s;weet and precious to us) to fit his Government as near as he could to the Laws of Nature e&s;tabli&s;hed upon Rea&s;on, carefully avoyding to forbid any thing that is naturally good in it &s;elf, and allowing the moderate u&s;e of them to all his Sub|jects. Among the re&s;t of his Laws there is one that commands Marriage to all men and women, as &s;oon as they are come to an Age fit for Generation, which Law and Cu&s;tom we inviolably ob&s;erve in all our Dominions. But becau&s;e many among us are &s;ometimes obliged to travel and leave their Wives at home, we keep in all Cities a number of women Slaves appointed for their u&s;e, &s;o that we do not only give every
<PB N="81" REF="52">
Traveller Meat, Drink, and Lodging, but al&s;o a Woman to lye with him as openly and lawfully as if &s;he were his Wife. Ac|cording to this laudable cu&s;tom, and being willing to u&s;e you as well as any of our own Nation, we have appointed &s;o many women as you are men to come and lie with you every other night &s;o long as you remain here with us if you can find in your hearts to u&s;e this priviledge.</Q></P>
<P><Q>You may ea&s;ily imagine that the&s;e rea|&s;ons quickly prevailed, and that he needed not u&s;e any further arguments to per&s;wade us to accept of the proffer. We gave him mo&s;t humble thanks, told him his Rea&s;ons were very powerful, and the Cu&s;tom of this Country much better than that of <HI>Eu|rope</HI> in our judgment.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Well, &s;aith he, u&s;e the priviledge if you plea&s;e, find out a method to agree among your &s;elves, and &s;o I wi&s;h you good night.</Q></P>
<P><Q>As &s;oon as he was gone there came in two men, who &s;pake to us in <HI>French,</HI> and bid us welcome to <HI>Sporunde;</HI> one of them told us, he was a Phy&s;ician, and his Com|panion a Chirurgeon. He de&s;ired us very earne&s;tly to be &s;incere with him, and to tell him whether any of us had any venereal di&s;temper upon him.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="82" REF="53">
<Q>Gentlemen, I am appointed to examine every one of you upon that &s;core, and if any deny the truth it will turn to his da|mage and &s;hame; but if he confe&s;s it inge|niou&s;ly he will get love, e&s;teem, and a &s;pee|dy cure.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Every one of the Company &s;aid he was free from any &s;uch thing; but notwith|&s;tanding our &s;aying &s;o, the man would not be &s;atisfied till he had &s;een and carefully ex|amined every one of us apart in a Room next to the Hall we &s;tood in. When he was &s;atisfied he told us he was very glad to find us all &s;ound and free from &s;o na&s;ty di&s;tem|per, very common in the other Continents, but only known by fame in the Southern Lands. He told us likewi&s;e, he had lived in <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Italy</HI> above &s;ix years, and &s;een mo&s;t parts of <HI>Europe</HI> and <HI>A&s;ta</HI> in the &s;pace of twelve years, and that from time to time there were men &s;ent from <HI>Sporund&egrave;</HI> beyond the Seas upon the &s;ame account, by which means they had per&s;ons among them who knew all tho&s;e Nations, and could &s;peak their Languages.

Languages, and to &s;ee &s;o many of our Fa&s;hions in &s;o remote a Country, where we &s;uppo&s;ed there could be none but barbarous People, if any at all. We would have &s;atisfied our curio&s;ity by asking this man &s;everal que&s;tions if the earne&s;t de&s;ire of going to bed had not prevailed with us, we therefore advi&s;ed how to find a method to proceed in the choice of the Women. It was at la&s;t agreed, That I, and then my two Mates &s;hould chu&s;e before any of the others, and then the Commonalty &s;hould ca&s;t Lots among them&s;elves, which was done accordingly without any di&s;pute or quarrelling, &s;o every man cho&s;e his bed|fellow. Then was I brought to my Cham|ber where I lay the night before, and my men to another long Gallery, on each &s;ide of which &s;tood little Chambers, divided one from another by thin partition-Walls made of white Plai&s;ter, not unlike the Cells of Nuns and Friers. Every Couple had one of the&s;e places, and lay there, till next day without any the lea&s;t di&s;turbance.</Q></P>
<P><Q>The next morning we heard the &s;ound of the Bell at the u&s;ual time, and <HI>Car&s;hid&agrave;</HI> came to me to ask me how I did, and to tell me it was time to ri&s;e. My Bedfellow had leaped out of the Bed, and put on her

Cloaths as &s;oon as &s;he had heard the Bell ring, and was but ju&s;t gone out of my Cham|ber when <HI>Car&s;hid&agrave;</HI> came into it. He told me <HI>Beno&s;car</HI> was gone to my men to take them out of Captivity, (meaning out of their Bedfellows embraces, and out of their Cells) where they had been locked all night le&s;t they &s;hould u&s;e the opportunity of per|mutation, not allowed in tho&s;e parts, le&s;t &s;ome of the women proving with Child the Father &s;hould be uncertain. When I was dre&s;t I went to the Hall, where my men came in like manner, and our Guides carri|ed us out to &s;hew us the Work-hou&s;es in &s;everal Squares of the City, where we &s;aw both men and women working very order|ly, &s;ome in Weaving and Sowing, others Forging, Carving, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> But <HI>Car&s;hid&agrave;</HI> told us, That the chiefe&s;t employment of the Nation con&s;i&s;ted in Building and Tilling of the ground.</Q></P>
<P><Q>We lived there in that manner till the &s;ixth day after our fir&s;t coming to <HI>Sporund&egrave;,</HI> expecting the return of the Me&s;&s;enger <HI>Albicormas</HI> had &s;ent to <HI>Sevarinde.</HI> He came at la&s;t with Orders to &s;end us to <HI>Sevarminas,</HI> who was very de&s;irous to &s;ee us. When I heard we were to march to <HI>Sevarinde</HI> I was &s;orry I had concealed your being here in
<PB N="85" REF="54">
this Camp, chiefly after we had found &s;o good u&s;age among&s;t tho&s;e People, and did hardly know how to mend the matter; but the rea&s;on I had at fir&s;t to do &s;o being a good and &s;olid rea&s;on I thought it would be received, and that <HI>Albicormas</HI> would forgive us the lye we told him, through the care we had for your &s;afety in a time when we much doubted of our own. I did ingenuou&s;ly confe&s;s the whole matter to <HI>Sermodas,</HI> who immediately went to <HI>Albicormas</HI> and told him what I had con|fe&s;&s;ed to him.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Thereupon we were ordered to continue in <HI>Sporund&egrave;</HI> till the return of another Me&s;|&s;enger, who was pre&s;ently di&s;patched to <HI>Sevarminas</HI> to acquaint him with the whole matter. He returned &s;ix days after his de|parture, and brought new Orders from <HI>Se|varind&egrave;</HI> to <HI>Albicormas,</HI> who in obedience to them, &s;ent us with all this Fleet to fetch you and carry us all to the great City, where we mu&s;t appear before the Soveraign Power that re&s;ides there, and where <HI>Sermodas</HI> tells me we &s;hall yet be better u&s;ed than we were at <HI>Sporund&egrave;.</HI></Q></P>
<P>Here <HI>Maurice</HI> made an end of his Speech, which filled us all both with joy and admi|ration,
<PB N="86" REF="55">
and &s;eemed not to hold any con&s;idera|ble time, though it had been long, and might have proved tedious upon another &s;ubject. But the things he related were &s;o full of wonder and novelty that we could have gi|ven him a quiet and patient hearing if his di&s;cour&s;e had taken up a whole days time.</P>
<P>We con&s;ulted a while what we had be&s;t to do, and re&s;olved at la&s;t to &s;ubmit to <HI>Sermodas</HI> in all things, to go whither he would carry us, and wholly to depend upon Gods Pro|vidence and the&s;e peoples Humanity.</P>
<P>While <HI>Maurice</HI> was relating all the&s;e ad|ventures to us. Some of his men, who burned with a de&s;ire to be talking of the &s;ame to their Friends in the Camp, got a&s;hore, and began to di&s;cour&s;e with our peo|ple, who gathering together in a ring about them, were all amazed at their relations, and were acquainted with the news almo&s;t as &s;oon as we, &s;o we needed not repeat any thing to them to let them know how our Affairs &s;tood. They were all willing to go to the&s;e fine places the Fellows had men|tioned and de&s;cribed to them, and wi&s;hed them&s;elves there already. One thing only vexed us all, and this was it, We were &s;till in &s;ome hopes that our fir&s;t Pinnace might have got to <HI>Batavia,</HI> which if it had, we did
<PB N="87" REF="55">
not doubt but the General would &s;end Ships to our relief as &s;oon as he &s;hould be informed with our misfortune. Now if tho&s;e Ships &s;hould come and not find us, they would conclude we were lo&s;t, and we &s;hould &s;ee our &s;elves deprived of all hopes of ever hearing from our Friends, and of re|turning to our Native Country. But <HI>Mau|rice</HI> told us, That there was no rea&s;on to fear in either of the&s;e ca&s;es, con&s;idering that we were fallen into the hands of a Civilized Nation, who had Ships, and &s;ent &s;ome of them from time to time beyond the Seas. And that it was probable we might get leave to go to the <HI>Indies</HI> if we did not like this new Country.</P>
<P>After we had ended the&s;e Con&s;ultations we went to my Hut, where we found <HI>Ser|modas</HI> ju&s;t got up from the Quilt where he had a while taken his re&s;t. He &s;miled at us when we came in, and asked us how we liked the De&s;cription <HI>Maurice</HI> had made us of the People and City of <HI>Sporund&egrave;?</HI> We an&s;we|red, We could not but like and admire both of them, and wi&s;h our &s;elves there if it was his plea&s;ure to carry us thither. I came for that purpo&s;e, &s;aid he, and I am very glad to find you &s;o well di&s;po&s;ed to go; you will find our Cities far better places to live in
<PB N="88" REF="56">
than this Camp, although through your in|du&s;try you have made it already a very fine Habitation.</P>
<P>We had &s;everal di&s;cour&s;es upon that and other &s;ubjects; after which we asked him, Whether he would not be plea&s;ed to eat and drink of &s;uch Victuals as we were able to give him? I will, &s;aith he, eat of your Vi|ctuals upon condition you will accept of &s;uch as we have brought along with us. Then he de&s;ired <HI>Maurice</HI> to &s;end for &s;ome of his men, and bid them bring &s;ome of the Ships Provi&s;ion, which together with ours made up a very good Fea&s;t.</P>
<P>When the Dinner was ended <HI>Sermodas</HI> told us, That &s;ince we were willing to go with him, we &s;hould u&s;e all diligence to put our &s;elves in readine&s;s, and order the tran&s;portation of our Men and Goods as we &s;hould think fitte&s;t; That he thought it con|venient the chiefe&s;t of us, and all our women &s;hould go aboard the &s;ame day, and he would leave &s;ome of his men a&s;hore, who together with &s;uch of ours as we &s;hould appoint &s;hould take care to &s;hip up all our things, and then come after us to <HI>Sporund&egrave;.</HI> Thereupon I told him we had another com|pany on the other &s;ide of the Bay, and if it was his plea&s;ure we &s;hould &s;end <HI>Maurice</HI>
<PB N="89" REF="56">
with a Ve&s;&s;el or two to fetch them. You may do &s;o, an&s;wered he, and I will order one of our Ships to go along with <HI>Maurice,</HI> and carry them from their Station directly to the City without coming back again to this Camp. Do you get &s;uch of your Officers as you like be&s;t to keep you company, and come along with me aboard my Ship, where you will find pa&s;&s;ing good accommodations.</P>
<P>I took only <HI>De Nuits</HI> and <HI>Turci</HI> my Secre|tary with me, and appointed <HI>Deve&s;e</HI> and the other Captain to command in my ab&s;ence, and &s;ee every thing tran&s;ported with good order and diligence.</P>
<P><HI>Sermodas</HI> left <HI>Beno&s;car</HI> with <HI>Deve&s;e</HI> to be his A&s;&s;i&s;tant and Conductor, and &s;o we &s;ailed toward <HI>Sporund&egrave;,</HI> where we landed the third day after our departure from <HI>Siden|berge.</HI> We were received in almo&s;t the &s;ame manner as <HI>Maurice</HI> had been, with this only difference, that <HI>De Nuits</HI> and I had a great deal more re&s;pect, and better atten|dance than he had had.</P>
<P><HI>Albicormas</HI> was very kind to us, and par|ticularly to me. We had &s;everal long con|ver&s;ations concerning the pre&s;ent &s;tate of <HI>Europe,</HI> wherein I was far better able to give him &s;atisfaction than any one of our Com|pany. I found he was a man of very excel|lent
<PB N="90" REF="57">
parts, learned in all &s;olid Sciences, and very well acquainted with the <HI>Greek</HI> and <HI>La|tine</HI> Tongues. We &s;pake <HI>Latine</HI> in all our conver&s;ations; for although he under&s;tood &s;ome of our Vulgar Languages, yet he could &s;peak none &s;o readily and &s;o eloquently as <HI>Latine.</HI> He told me many things concerning the Cu&s;toms and Government of their Nati|on, which I will faithfully &s;et out when I come to de&s;cribe the City, Laws, and Man|ners of the <HI>Sevarambi.</HI></P>
<P>The day after our coming to this Town all our People and Luggage arrived there, and nothing was left in the Camp but what they thought was not worth taking. They were all u&s;ed as <HI>Maurices</HI> men, and had new and clean Cloaths given them every man and woman.</P>
<P>But there aro&s;e &s;ome difficulty concerning our Women, for as you may remember it was ordered in the Camp that one woman &s;hould &s;erve five of our common men, and none but our Principal Officers were allowed to have one woman wholly every Officer to him&s;elf.</P>
<P><HI>Sermodas</HI> and his Companions were much di&s;plea&s;ed with this Plurality of men to one woman, and told us it was &s;o bea&s;tly a thing as was not to be &s;uffered, and rather than to endure it they would provide more women
<PB N="91" REF="57">
for our men to keep them from that filthy and wor&s;e than bruti&s;h practice. We excu|&s;ed our &s;elves upon the nece&s;&s;ity of our con|dition, and told him he might order the matter as he thought be&s;t him&s;elf. Will you, &s;aith he, heartily conform to our Laws and and Cu&s;toms? We told him, We de&s;ired to do &s;o, and thought it our be&s;t way. Well then, &s;aith he, number out your men and women, and give me a Li&s;t of them all; and let me know likewi&s;e, how many of your Women are with Child, and we will take care that you &s;hall be &s;upplied with eve|ry thing you want in that particular accord|ing to the manner of the Country. We gave him an exact account of every thing accord|ing to his de&s;ire; and then he &s;aid, That if any one of us was willing to &s;tick to any of the Women we had, who was not with Child, he might do it; Furthermore, we &s;hould agree of a method for every one how to chu&s;e his Bedfellow, for there would be a number of Slaves allowed to &s;upply the want of our Women. We con&s;ulted among us how to proceed in that matter, and it was agreed, That every Principal Officer, who had a woman wholly to him&s;elf, might keep her &s;till if he plea&s;ed, or take a Slave of the Country, chu&s;ing according to his degree;
<PB N="92" REF="58">
and that the Commonalty &s;hould ca&s;t Lots as <HI>Maurice</HI> his men had done before. Some of the&s;e Officers &s;tuck to their old Bedfel|lows, but others had rather chu&s;e a new one than to keep &s;uch as they were already wea|ry of; the inferiour &s;ort cho&s;e according to their Lot; and <HI>Maurices</HI> men not being al|lowed to make a new choice mu&s;t be content to keep tho&s;e women they had cho&s;e at the fir&s;t. The women who were with child by any Officer were commanded to &s;tick to the Father of the Child, although he was al|lowed a fre&s;h woman be&s;ides; as for tho&s;e of the Commonalty that had a great belly, they were obliged to &s;tick to one of the five men who lay with them, and exhorted to chu&s;e, as near as they could, the man whom they thought to be the true Father of the Child. And that was the Method according to which this matter was ordered, much to mo&s;t of our Womens grief and di&s;content.</P>
<P>The fifth day after we were come to <HI>Spo|rund&egrave;, Sermodas</HI> came to me in the morning, and told me, That I mu&s;t prepare to go to the Temple, where the <HI>O&s;parenibon</HI> or Mar|riage Solemnities were to be celebrated. He told me farther, That the &s;ame was kept four times a year, and that it was the greate&s;t Fe&s;tival they had, though much inferiour to
<PB N="93" REF="58">
that of <HI>Sevarund&egrave;,</HI> which was the mo&s;t magnificent in the world. I got up and put on the new Cloaths that were brought me, and to every one of our Principal Officers who came to my Chamber to go with me to the Temple along with <HI>Sermodas</HI> and <HI>Car|&s;hid&agrave;</HI> our perpetual Leaders. We went toge|ther to the Palace, where <HI>Albicormas</HI> had gi|ven us Audience, and having pa&s;&s;ed through &s;everal Courts we came at la&s;t to a large and magnificent Temple, where we &s;aw a great many young men and women together in new Apparel, and wearing upon their heads, the men wreaths of green boughs; and the women Garlands of Flowers. They altoge|ther made the lovelie&s;t &s;how that ever I &s;aw, being mo&s;t of them very proper and hand|&s;ome.</P>
<P>The farther end of the Temple was kept from our &s;ight by a large Curtain which di|vided it almo&s;t in the middle; we &s;tood there near an hour, looking upon the rich Orna|ments, and the &s;everal Objects of the place before we heard or &s;aw any alteration, but at the la&s;t we heard the &s;ound of &s;everal Trumpets drawing near to us; we heard likewi&s;e the Harmony of many Flutes and Houboyes, which played very &s;weet and airy Tunes. Then came in a great number
<PB N="94" REF="59">
of People with lighted Torches in their hands, and &s;et them up in divers places of the Temple, where hanged divers Candle|&s;ticks di&s;po&s;ed in a very good order. The Windows were clo&s;e &s;hut up, and the Cur|tain drawn, which di&s;covered the other end of the Church, where we &s;aw at a di&s;tance a great Altar very rich and magnificent, adorned with Garlands and Fe&s;tons of fre&s;h flowers ingeniou&s;ly done up together. About it, and in the Wall, again&s;t which it was &s;et up, we &s;aw a great Globe of Cry&s;tal, or ve|ry clear Gla&s;s, as big about as four men can fathom, which ca&s;t &s;uch a light as enlight|ned all that end at a very great di&s;tance. On the other &s;ide was a great Statue, repre&s;ent|ing a Woman with many brea&s;ts, and &s;uck|ling as many little Children, all very curi|ou&s;ly cut. In the middle of the&s;e two Figures we &s;aw nothing but a large black Curtain, plain without any Ornaments. While we were looking upon the&s;e Objects, the Mu|&s;ick came nearer and nearer, and at la&s;t into the Temple. Then turning our eyes that way, we &s;aw <HI>Albicormas;</HI> with all his Senators, coming towards the Altar in great Pomp and State. As &s;oon as he came in, &s;everal Prie&s;ts went to meet him with <HI>Thuribula,</HI> Cen&s;ors in their hands, and &s;inging a Can|ticle.
<PB N="95" REF="59">
They bowed to him three times, and then turned and lead him to the Altar, where he and his men inclined their bodies three times to the Curtain, twice to the Luminous Globe, and once to the Statue: Then he took his Seat on the right hand of the place again&s;t the Wall, where &s;everal high Thrones were &s;et up to receive him and his Company, and &s;o many on the other &s;ide on the like manner. <HI>Sermodas</HI> brought me to a Seat un|der <HI>Albicormas</HI> his feet with three more of my men, and placed the re&s;t over-again&s;t us on the other&s;ide.</P>
<P>We were no &s;ooner &s;et down but three of the Prie&s;ts went towards the young People, and called them to the Altar. They divided into two parts, and all the Men came order|ly on the right hand, and the Women on the left. Then did the Principal Prie&s;t &s;tand up on a high place in the middle of all, and made a &s;hort &s;peech unto them; which done, fire was brought in lighted by the Sun|beams, as I under&s;tood afterwards. This fire being brought in, <HI>Albicormas</HI> came down to the Altar, where he lighted &s;ome Aromati|cal &s;ticks that lay upon it with that fire, and kneeling before the Luminous Globe, &s;pake aloud &s;ome words, which then I could not under&s;tand. From the Globe he went
<PB N="96" REF="60">
to the Statue, and bending down one of his knees only, he made there another &s;hort Speech or Prayer, which done, the Prie&s;ts &s;ang an Anthem, which was an&s;wered by the People. When this &s;hort Anthem was ended, &s;everal Mu&s;ical In&s;truments began to play very &s;weet and melodious Tunes. A Chorus of men and women &s;ucceeded the&s;e In&s;truments, and &s;ang &s;o Divinely that we all thought we were in Heaven, our Voyces and Mu&s;ick in <HI>Europe</HI> being not comparable to the&s;e. When this Symphony was ended, the chiefe&s;t Prie&s;t went to the young woman, who &s;tood at the upper end of the Row, and asked her, <HI>Whether &s;he would be married?</HI> She, making a low inclination, and blu&s;hing at the &s;ame time, an&s;wered, <HI>Yes.</HI> Then did he go to all the others, asked them the &s;ame que&s;tion aloud, and received the like an&s;wer. The &s;ame was done on the other &s;ide where the young men &s;tood, and when all the&s;e que&s;tions were asked, and an&s;we|red, the Prie&s;t went again to the uppermo&s;t Maid, and asked her, <HI>Whether &s;he would mar|ry any one of the young men who &s;tood on the other &s;ide?</HI> Whereunto &s;he an&s;wered, <HI>Yes.</HI> Then did the Prie&s;t take her by the hand, and brought her to the uppermo&s;t young man of the other row, and bid her chu&s;e her Hu&s;|band.
<PB N="97" REF="60">
She looked upon the fir&s;t young man, and then upon the others &s;ucce&s;&s;ively, until the came to the &s;ixth, and there &s;he &s;topped and asked him, <HI>Whether he would be her good Lord and faithful Husband?</HI> He an&s;wered, That he would be &s;o, <HI>if &s;he would be his loving and loyal Wife.</HI> Which &s;he &s;aid, <HI>She would be till death &s;hould part them.</HI> After this &s;olemn and mutual promi&s;e, he took her by the hand, ki&s;&s;ed her, and walked with her to the lower end of the Temple. All the others did &s;ucce&s;&s;ively do the &s;ame till they were all marched down by Couples.</P>
<P>But there remained eight young women who could get no Husbands: Five of them &s;eemed to be full of confu&s;ion, and tears trickled down their eyes in great abundance. The three others looked not &s;o dejected, and when the Prie&s;t came to them they got hold of his Robes, and went along with him to <HI>Albicormas.</HI> He &s;pake &s;ome words to them, and then they went to three &s;everal Sena|tors, and &s;aid, That &s;ince it was their ill fortune not to be able to get &s;ingle men to their Husbands, they made choice of them to take away their reproach that lay upon their heads, after having three times been &s;lighted publickly. Therefore they de&s;ired
<PB N="98" REF="61">
them, that, according to the Laws, and their particular priviledge, they would receive them into the number of their Wives, pro|mi&s;ing to be very loving and faithful to them. The three Senators came down immediate|ly, took them by the hand, and carried them to the Altar, where they &s;tood till all the others came up by Couples. The five afflicted Virgins were asked by one of the Prie&s;ts, <HI>Whether they had a mind to chu&s;e any of the Officers?</HI> To which they an&s;wered, <HI>That this being the fir&s;t time they had tried their Fortune, they were willing to try twice more before they took that cour&s;e.</HI> Then pulling down their Vails they marched out of the Temple, and got into a Chariot, ready to receive them at the Gate, and &s;o went away much di&s;contented.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as they were out of &s;ight the Mu&s;ick began to play very merry Tunes, and <HI>Albicormas</HI> going to the Altar &s;pake &s;ome words aloud, and taking the three fir&s;t Maids, and the three Senators, joyned their hands together, and &s;pake &s;ome words, to which they made an&s;wer, and bowed very humbly to him. He did the like to &s;even or eight Couples more, and at la&s;t leaving the Office to other Senators, he went up again
<PB N="99" REF="61">
to his Throne. The like Ceremony was u&s;ed to all the re&s;t, and when it was done, two Prie&s;ts took the fire from the Altar, brought it to the middle of the Temple, and the new married Folks made a ring about it. Every one of them had &s;ome Gums or Per|fumes in their hands, and each Couple mix|ing them together threw them into the fire: Then kneeling down, laid their hands upon a yellow Book, which two Prie&s;ts held in their hands, <HI>Swore obedience to the Laws, and promi&s;ed to maintain them to the utmo&s;t of their power till the end of their lives, taking God the Sun, and their Country to witne&s;s of their Oaths.</HI> Then did they march to the Altar again, where <HI>Albicormas</HI> made a &s;hort Prayer, they being upon their knees, and turning towards them gave them his ble&s;&s;ing, which done, he marched out of the Temple, all the Com|pany following after, and the Mu&s;ick play|ing all in a Con&s;ort. Next, they went into a great Hall near unto the Temple, where &s;tood many Tables, which were immediately covered with meat.</P>
<P><HI>Albicormas</HI> took me and <HI>Van de Nuits,</HI> told us we &s;hould be his Gue&s;ts that day, and bringing us to the uppermo&s;t Table, &s;ate down with his chiefe&s;t Officers, and made
<PB N="100" REF="62">
us &s;it with them. <HI>Sermodas</HI> took the re&s;t of my men to another Table, and the Com|monalty of our People, who &s;tood in a Gal|lery all the time of the Ceremony, were carried home again by <HI>Car&s;hid&agrave;</HI> and <HI>Beno&s;|car.</HI></P>
<P>We had a very noble Fea&s;t, &s;everal In&s;tru|ments of Mu&s;ick playing all the while we fate. After Dinner we marched out into the Amphitheater, which &s;tood about a Musket &s;hot from the Temple, and all the way we went we found the Streets &s;trewed with herbs and flowers, and heard the acclamati|ons of a great multitude of People, who came out to &s;ee us pa&s;s. This Amphitheater is &s;trongly built with very large &s;tone, and is no le&s;s than fifty paces Diameter, counting from outer Wall to outer Wall. It is cove|red with a prodigious high and large Vault, which &s;helters the place from the Sun, and from all injuries of weather. There are Seats round about it one over the other, from top to bottom, which take up a great deal of Room, and &s;treighten the Pit to an indif|ferent bigne&s;s. The upper Seats were full of people, and none but the Officers and the new married Folks were admitted into the pit except &s;ome young men, who exerci&s;ed
<PB N="101" REF="62">
them&s;elves a while in Wra&s;tling, Fencing, Leaping, and in many other acts of Agility, which was no unplea&s;ant &s;ight. Then fell our People to dancing, and kept &s;o till it was almo&s;t night, at which time the Trum|pets and other In&s;truments &s;ounded out a retreat. We marched out in the &s;ame manner as we came, and found in the Streets many fire-works, which made a &s;econd day of the night. <HI>Albicormas</HI> and his Company went home in their Chariots, and the new marri|ed people to the Lodgings prepared for them, where I &s;uppo&s;e they enjoyed one another all night to their hearts content: and <HI>Ser|modas</HI> carried us home again, where he explained to us &s;everal parts of the Cere|mony. The next morning he came to us and asked whether we would go to the Tem|ple again to &s;ee another Ceremony which was but a con&s;equence of the former; to which we readily a&s;&s;enting he carried us away, and made us &s;tand a while at the Temple-gate. Soon after we heard a &s;ound of Mu&s;ick com|ing towards us, and &s;aw the new married men coming to the Temple, each of them with a long and green bough in his hand, where were hung up the Wreath he wore the day before, and his Wives Garland, tied toge|ther

with a white Clout &s;tained with bloud, which were the marks of his Wives Virgi|nity. They came all into the Temple in a triumphing manner, and being come to the Altar laid down their Garlands upon it, con|&s;ecrating them <HI>to the Deity, to the Sun, their King, and to their Country,</HI> which is repre|&s;ented by the Statue I &s;pake of before. After this Con&s;ecration they went out dancing at the &s;ound of the merry Tunes, the In&s;tru|ments played till they came to their homes.</P>
<P>This Fe&s;tival la&s;ted three whole days with a general joy and merriment throughout the whole Town.</P>
<P>Now our time was come to leave the City of <HI>Sporund&egrave;,</HI> and to march to <HI>Seva|rind&egrave;. Sermodas,</HI> gave us warning of it the day before we went, and carried me, <HI>Van de Nuits,</HI> and <HI>Maurice</HI> to <HI>Albicormas</HI> to take our leave of him. We went together to his hou&s;e, which we found to be a noble and &s;tately Palace, though much inferiour to the City Palace both in bigne&s;s and &s;tate. He received us very kindly, and told us that the day following we mu&s;t take our Journey to <HI>Sevarind&egrave;</HI> to wait upon <HI>Sevarminas.</HI> Then he asked us how we liked <HI>Sporund&egrave;,</HI> and the Ceremonies we had &s;een in the celebration
<PB N="103" REF="63">
of the <HI>O&s;par&eacute;nibon.</HI> We an&s;wered, We liked every thing even to admiration. You have &s;een nothing yet, and you are going to a place as far above this as the Sun is above the Moon. I will not too much prepo&s;&s;e&s;s your minds with the glory of it, knowing experience will teach you more than I can tell you. <HI>Sermodas</HI> is to be your Guide, he will be very tender of you, and I admoni&s;h you to take his Coun&s;el in every thing, and to carry your &s;elves &s;o prudently that the great <HI>Sevarminas</HI> may love and cheri&s;h you as heartily as I have done. Then he ki&s;&s;ed us in the forehead, and bid us fare|well.</P>
<P>The next morning early we were carried to the Water&s;ide on the We&s;t part of the City, where we found &s;everal great Barges ready to receive us. <HI>Sermodas</HI> brought me and three or four of my men into an indiffe|rent big one, but rarely carved, gilt, and painted. Our other men and women were di&s;tributed into other Ve&s;&s;els, and in that manner we rowed up the River, which running through a very flat and Champain Country flowed down very &s;lowly. We &s;aw along the Banks of it &s;everal great buildings like tho&s;e we had &s;een below the City. We

had many Rowers, who relieved one ano|ther from time to time; &s;o we went up with great &s;peed, and never &s;topped till we came to an indifferent great City, called <HI>Sporum&egrave;,</HI> about thirty miles above <HI>Sporund&egrave;.</HI> We were expected there at that day, and &s;o we found great numbers of people upon the Key, who came out to &s;ee us land. A little before our Barge came to the City, a Ve&s;&s;el full of &s;eve|ral Officers, cloathed like tho&s;e of <HI>Sporund&egrave;,</HI> came to meet us, and &s;ome of them leaping into our Barge expre&s;&s;ed a great deal of re|&s;pect to <HI>Sermodas,</HI> and much civility to us. We went a&s;hore with them, where &s;tayed for us the Governour of the place, called <HI>P&s;arkimbas. Sermodas</HI> and he embraced one another, and had &s;ome di&s;cour&s;e together, after which he kindly &s;aluted us, and bid us welcom into the Country in the Latine Tongue. Then addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to me, embracing me, and ki&s;&s;ing me in the Fore|head, he &s;aid he would be glad to have a lit|tle private di&s;cour&s;e with me &s;ometime of the next day. I an&s;wered, I was at his com|mand, after which we followed him into the City, which we found to be built much after the manner of <HI>Sporund&egrave;,</HI> and about half as big as it, &s;tanding in a fine and fruit|ful

&s;oyl, the be&s;t manured and tilled we had ever &s;een before. We were received and u&s;ed in this place as at <HI>Sporund&egrave;,</HI> without any great difference, and &s;tayed there all the day following, not ob&s;erving any thing re|markable in it but the exemplary puni&s;h|ment which in the afternoon was inflicted upon fourteen Malefactors in this man|ner:</P>
<P>They were taken out of Pri&s;on fa&s;t tied together with Ropes, and divided into three parts. In the fir&s;t were &s;ix men, who as we were told had been condemned to ten years puni&s;hment, &s;ome for Murther, and others for committing Adultery. In the &s;e|cond were five young women, whereof two were condemned to &s;uffer puni&s;hment du|ring &s;even years, to &s;atisfie the Law, and afterwards &s;o long as their Husbands plea&s;ed, and this was for having lain with other men. The three others were condemned to &s;uffer three years puni&s;hment for having been de|bauched before their <HI>O&s;parenibon</HI> was come, or the time of their marrying, which is at the eighteenth year of their age. In the third were the three young men who debauched the&s;e maids, and they were to &s;uffer the like puni&s;hment, and at la&s;t marry them. They

<P>The&s;e poor Pri&s;oners were &s;tript of all their cloaths from their &s;houlders to the middle of their bodies, and we &s;aw their naked skins very plainly. I remember that one of the women, who had committed Adultery, was a very proper and lu&s;ty wo|man, not above one or two and twenty years of age. She had a very beautiful face, black eyes, brown hair, and a delicate clear skin. But her brea&s;ts, which we &s;aw quite naked, were the lovelie&s;t I ever beheld. This was the fir&s;t time &s;he was brought to her puni&s;h|ment, &s;o that her &s;hame was extraordinary. Tears trickled down her cheeks in great abundance; and the&s;e in&s;tead of taking off from her natural beauty, did on the contra|ry &s;o much add to it that I never admired any thing like this beautiful Criminal. Ad|mirarion produced love, and pity joyning with tho&s;e two Pa&s;&s;ions did &s;o move the hearts of all the Spectators, that there was hardly any ingenious Per&s;on who was not moved to an extreme compa&s;&s;ion. But their pity was turned to a kind of generous in|dignation, when they con&s;idered that with|in

a few moments all the&s;e divine Charms were to be &s;oiled and prophaned by the cruel &s;tripes of a barbarous Executioner: Yet this was an act of ju&s;tice ordained by the Laws again&s;t a Crime which among tho&s;e people is look'd upon as one of the greate&s;t; &s;o there was no means to &s;ave this lovely Per&s;on from the rigour of the Law, and the Officer had already lifted up his &s;courge, and was going to &s;trike, when of a &s;udden her Husband, running through the croud, cried with a loud voice, Hold, hold, hold. All the Spectators, and the Officers them|&s;elves, hearing this voice were much &s;ur|prized, and turned their eyes on the &s;ide from which they heard the voice come, &s;u&s;|pending the execution till they knew what this mans meaning was. He came to them almo&s;t out of breath, as having with much ado pa&s;&s;ed through the crowd, and, addre&s;|&s;ing his Speech to the chief Officer, &s;aid, pointing at his Wife, Sir, I am that mi&s;e|rable womans Husband, and therefore much concerned in this Execution. Before &s;he re|ceive her puni&s;hment I de&s;ire to &s;peak &s;ome|thing to her in your pre&s;ence, after which you will know more of my mind. Then having got leave of the Officer, he &s;pake to

her in this manner: You know <HI>&V;lisb&egrave;</HI> with how great a pa&s;&s;ion I loved you for the &s;pace of three years before our Marriage; You know likewi&s;e, that &s;ince we have been uni|ted my love hath rather increa&s;ed than de|crea&s;ed and that I have given you all the te&s;timonies of a tender, &s;incere, and con|&s;tant affection for the&s;e four years that a wo|man could expect from her Husband. I was per&s;waded that you had for me the &s;ame Sentiments, and that your flame was equal to mine; and as criminal as you have proved, &s;ince I believe &s;till that I have the be&s;t &s;hare of your divided heart, knowing that you have been &s;educed by the wicked <HI>Claniba's</HI> wiles, and &s;ubtil devices to com|mit a crime which you would not have com|mitted out of your natural Propen&s;ity. Within this three hours I have been inform|ed of his wicked practices, and know that you could not be drawn to comply with his de&s;ires till you were per&s;waded I had wrong|ed you, and done with his Wife that which, in your ill grounded indignation and de&s;ire of revenge, you have &s;ince done with him; If I had known &s;o much before, you had not come to this place in this infamous manner, and I would rather have forgiven you
<PB N="109" REF="67">
the wrong you have done to our Conjugal bed, and concealed your Crime than brought you to this &s;evere and &s;hameful puni&s;hment. I cannot altogether free you from it, becau&s;e you mu&s;t &s;atisfie the Law and your Country which you have grievou&s;ly offended; but if the tears I &s;ee you &s;hed, and the &s;ighs and &s;obs I hear out of your mouth be true &s;igns of repentance, if you have &s;till in your brea&s;t any remainder of that love &s;o &s;incere which you once profe&s;&s;ed to me with &s;o many ob|liging demon&s;trations, and if you promi&s;e me that you will wholly give me your heart again, I will &s;ave you from the cruel &s;tripes that are ready to fall upon you, and &s;uffer them mine own &s;elf, rather than &s;ee them laid upon you. Speak <HI>&V;lisbe,</HI> and let not your &s;ilence be an Argument of your ob|duratene&s;s, and indifferency for me; There he &s;topt, and the woman, almo&s;t drown'd in her tears, was &s;ilent a while before &s;he could utter any words, but at la&s;t &s;he re|turned him this an&s;wer, My &s;ilence, O too Generous <HI>Brami&s;tes,</HI> is not an Argument of my ob&s;tinacy, or indifferency, but of my &s;hame and confu&s;ion. I have injured you contrary to the Sacred Laws of Ju&s;tice, and honour; I have defiled our Conjugal Bed,

and whether I have done it out of a ju&s;t revenge, or out of any other cau&s;e, I am guilty, and de&s;erve to &s;uffer a far greater puni&s;hment than is ordained for the ex|piation of my Crime; Do not trouble your &s;elf for me, I am a fit Object of your indignation, and ju&s;t revenge, and not of your unde&s;erved pity. All that I beg of you is That you would believe that I am truly penitent, and that I would endure with gladne&s;s the cruelle&s;t torments, and at la&s;t lo&s;e my wretched life to &s;atisfie you if it were po&s;&s;ible. Why &s;hould you receive upon your innocent body the &s;tripes which ought ju&s;tly to fall upon mine? Ah, why &s;hould I be freed from a pain due to me, and not to you? To make it &s;hort, there was a long Conte&s;tation betwixt the Hu&s;|band and the Wife, which made all tho&s;e, who could hear them, &s;hed tears; and at la&s;t the bu&s;ine&s;s came to this, That the Man received the Blows which were pre|pared for his Wife. He was tied with her, and they, with all the other, were whipt three times round the Palace, and then &s;ent to Pri&s;on again. It &s;eems that the Women in that Country have that priviledge to be exempted from &s;uch

cha&s;ti&s;ement if any body will &s;uffer it for them, whereof I was told that there had been many examples upon &s;everal occa&s;i|ons. After this Execution we went home again, where <HI>P&s;arkimbas</HI> and I had above an hours di&s;cour&s;e together about the Affairs of <HI>Europe,</HI> and &s;uch like matters as <HI>Atticormas</HI> and all the other Officers had been inqui&s;itive of.</P>
<P>The next morning we took leave of <HI>P&s;arkimbas,</HI> and went to the Water-&s;ide again, where we found other Barges ready to receive us. <HI>Sermodas</HI> went into one of them, taking me and the other per&s;on who travelled with us before, and &s;o we rowed up the River five or &s;ix miles above it, where we found a Town con&s;i&s;ting only of eight &s;quare Buildings like tho&s;e of <HI>Sporum&egrave;</HI> There we found other Barges of another fa&s;hion waiting for us, &s;o with|out lo&s;ing any time we went into them, and were drawn up by hor&s;es again&s;t the &s;tream of the River, which growing &s;trong in this place, we could not row up any farther.

<P>From <HI>Sporunid&egrave;</HI> we were drawn up to another le&s;&s;er place fourteen miles above it, called <HI>Sporunik&egrave;,</HI> where we took fre&s;h hor&s;es, and went up eight miles farther the &s;ame day to another little Town, called <HI>Sporavi&s;t&egrave;,</HI> where we lay that night, and where we ob&s;erved nothing remarkable.</P>
<P>The next day in the morning we found &s;everal Chariots and Wagons ready to re|ceive us; <HI>Sermodas</HI> took me, <HI>De Nuits,</HI> and <HI>Maurice</HI> only to bear him company, and &s;o leaving the River on the We&s;t &s;ide we went directly to the Southward, and drew nearer and nearer to the Mountains, the ground ri&s;ing by degrees as we went towards them, although the Country be flat and plain to the very foot of them, which is the rea&s;on of their &s;teepne&s;s.</P>

<HEAD>TO THE READER.</HEAD>
<P><HI>I</HI> Have here recommended to thy peru&s;al the Second Part of the rare Country of the <HI>Seva|rites:</HI> a Country &s;o curious and &s;o plea&s;ant, that if thou had&s;t ever been there, thou coulde&s;t never have had the lea&s;t inclination to dwell in any other part of the World. I know &s;ome will be carping and quar|relling at this Narration, like tho&s;e unrea&s;onable Animals, that are al|ways fretting to &s;ee things with which they are not well acquainted.
<PB REF="76">
But the&s;e poor Souls that have &s;een nothing but the compa&s;s of their Cradle, and have confined their knowledge within the narrow limits of their own Territory, cannot well conceive nor imagine the glorious things, and the &s;trange Wonders that appear to Travellers beyond the Seas in Foreign Nations. Ca|ptain <HI>Siden</HI> was one of the most famous of his Time, a Man well known for a worthy and approved Per&s;on. What account he hath gi|ven of the&s;e rare People is not &s;o publick, I confe&s;s, as could be wi&s;h|ed, becau&s;e the Per&s;ons and the Na|tion, who have now a Corre&s;pon|dency in tho&s;e Parts, have di&s;cou|raged all others, by declaring the&s;e
<PB REF="76">
things to be fabulous, becau&s;e they intend to ingro&s;s all the Trade to them&s;elves. The Advantages many <HI>Dutch</HI> Families have received by them already, is incredible. The va&s;t Trea&s;ure they have heaped up in a few years, is beyond all belief. They have met with &s;ome new Mines of Gold in this golden Country, and rai&s;ed their Families to an extraor|dinary Grandeur. It is an idle hu|mour in any of us to de&s;pi&s;e or re|ject &s;trange Di&s;coveries. If all our wi&s;e Forefathers had been of the &s;ame temper, the <HI>Indies</HI> had always been unknown to the <HI>European</HI> People, and we &s;hould again burn &s;uch as dare affirm, that there is a <HI>Jamaica</HI> or an <HI>America,</HI> a World
<PB REF="77">
under us. Our Nation heretofore, and the <HI>French</HI> Court, lo&s;t the ad|vantage which the <HI>Spaniard</HI> hath well improved, through incredulity. It is therefore good in all &s;uch ca&s;es as this, to weigh the Rea&s;ons and Arguments on both &s;ides, and to judge of the probabilities of this Coun|try. If any thing is here related of this Country or People &s;eemingly beyond all po&s;&s;ibility, we mu&s;t know, that as this People have the advan|tage of living in the earthly Para|di&s;e, they have knowledges of Na|ture and natural Effects, which look like Miracles. Captain <HI>Siden</HI> and his <HI>Dutch</HI> Camrades vi&s;ited many places, and &s;aw &s;ome other I&s;lands thereabouts, which are as full
<PB REF="77">
of Curio&s;ities as tho&s;e we have here taken notice of. But that this Re|lation might not be too voluminous, and the Account too tedious to the ingenious Reader, I thought fit to &s;et &s;ome of his Papers a&s;ide, and &s;peak only of the chief Country of the <HI>Sevarites;</HI> hoping that the&s;e lines may give &s;ome an incouragement, when they are at <HI>Cap de bon E&s;peran|za,</HI> to direct their Cour&s;e a little out of the way, and to vi&s;it this Coun|try, which lies Southwe&s;t and by South from the Point. If the Charge and Danger don't di&s;courage them, doubt|le&s;s &s;ome brave generous Soul may get to him&s;elf an immortal Name, and Wealth enough to pay his Charges, if he returns as &s;afe as Captain <HI>Siden</HI>
<PB REF="78">
did. However I wi&s;h that this Narrative may give you all as much &s;atisfaction as you can de&s;ire or wi&s;h for.</P>

<HEAD>THE SECOND PART OF THE HISTORY OF THE <HI>SEVARITES.</HI></HEAD>
<P>AT the foot of the great Mountains we re&s;ted three days upon the Borders of <HI>Sevaramb&egrave;,</HI> in a little Town called by the Inhabitants <HI>Cola,</HI> from the delight&s;omne&s;s of the place; for it &s;tands upon a &s;mall Ri&s;ing, and is wa|tered by three plea&s;ant Rivers, <HI>Banon, Caru,</HI> and <HI>Silkar,</HI> which render the ground there|abouts extraordinary fruitful beyond all credit, to a miracle. For &s;ome have told me, that they have u&s;ually in their fields every year four Crops of Corn, becau&s;e the ground wants neither heat nor humi|dity to bring forth, and is never parched with the drought of Summer; for here as
<PB N="2" REF="79">
well as in all the Kingdom of <HI>Sevaramb&egrave;,</HI> they know no difference between Summer and Winter, unle&s;s it be by the cour&s;e of the Sun and Stars, which draw nearer to or farther from the Northern and Southern Poles. <HI>Sermodas</HI> had here many old Ac|quaintances, and particularly a &s;he-friend, who cau&s;ed us to &s;tay in this place longer than we purpo&s;ed at fir&s;t. For our great expectation and earne&s;t de&s;ire was to pa&s;s over the Mountains into <HI>Sevaramb&egrave;,</HI> to in|joy the delights of that Paradi&s;e on Earth. But whiles <HI>Sermodas</HI> was diverting him&s;elf one way, he cau&s;ed &s;ome Diverti&s;ement to be given us another way, that our abode there might not &s;eem too tedious. He in|treated &s;ome of the chief of the place to &s;hew us their Gardens of Plea&s;ure, and to lead us out into the Fields to hunt the O&s;trich with Beagles, and Grey-hounds, or Dogs not much unlike that &s;ort which we have in <HI>Europe.</HI> This Hunting was perfor|med in Parks, where this &s;ort of Game was kept for Diver&s;ion. The plea&s;ure that it afforded to us, and the extraordinary acti|ons which were thereby repre&s;ented, cau|&s;ed us not to think the time long, or our abode in that place tedious, though we were in great expectation of injoying
<PB N="3" REF="79">
&s;weeter Delights beyond the Mountains in a Country &s;o far excelling all others in the World, according to the relation which had been given to us.</P>
<P>It is the u&s;ual cu&s;tom of all Travellers that pa&s;s often through this Town, to have a &s;he-Comrade, with whom they are wont to &s;pend &s;ome days. For in the Country of <HI>Sevaramb&egrave;</HI> &s;uch kind of natural delights are not allowable by the Laws of the Country, nor agreeable with the &s;trict lives and &s;e|were Cu&s;toms of the Inhabitants, nor with the nature of the Air; for at the fir&s;t enter|tainment of inordinate lu&s;t, &s;uch di&s;order happens in the blood and veins of men, that their countenances are immediately chan|ged, and their skins are covered with Boils and Scabs, chiefly their No&s;es, which have &s;o great a corre&s;pondency with the noble Members. For this cau&s;e the Inhabitants of <HI>Sevaramb&egrave;</HI> abominate the lea&s;t &s;ign of all la&s;civiou&s;ne&s;s. I never was among&s;t a more temperate and orderly Generation. All Pa&s;&s;engers therefore u&s;e to make a due pre|paration before they can or are admitted to pa&s;s over the Mountains. At this Town of <HI>Cola</HI> therefore Travellers &s;top to refre&s;h them&s;elves with tho&s;e delights which are only allowable in <HI>Sporumbe.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="80">
After three days re&s;t <HI>Sermodas</HI> had provi+ded all things needful for our pa&s;&s;ing over the Mountains, &s;ome Provi&s;ions and Car+riages. We had to each man of us an Uni+corn appointed to carry us. This Creature by the skill of the <HI>Sporvi</HI> are brought to be as tame as our Hor&s;es. They &s;eemed to me far &s;tronger and more &s;wift, and &s;o &s;ure footed, that though we climbed over Rocks and Mountains, there was none of them &s;een &s;o much as to &s;tumble or fall. In&s;tead of a Bit and Bridle we held in our hands a &s;ilken cord tyed to the horn, which was in the front of the Bea&s;t, and at the lea&s;t mo+tion it would bend and turn, and go a &s;wifter or &s;lower pace, according to our de&s;ire. I inquired &s;everal things concer+ning this Animal, which I could never hear of in all <HI>Europe. Sermodas</HI> gave me great &s;atisfaction, and informed me of its nature, properties, and excellent qualities, &s;o that I had brought &s;ome over with me into my own Country, had not this tran&s;portation been forbidden by the Law of that place.</P>
<P>We took our leaves of <HI>Cola</HI> about noon after a plentiful Dinner. An Unicorn of a Che&s;tnut colour, with many black &s;pots on the right &s;ide, and white on the left, was prepared for me to mount upon. At the
<PB N="5" REF="80">
fir&s;t when I &s;aw the nimblene&s;s of the Bea&s;t, I was afraid to venture my &s;elf upon it, and could not be per&s;waded to make any u&s;e of it, till <HI>Sermodas</HI> a&s;&s;ured me, that it was one of the gentle&s;t Creatures in the World, and &s;o extraordinary &s;wift, that we pa&s;&s;ed over the Mountains through uneven ways into <HI>Severamb&egrave;</HI> in a day and a half, being near three&s;core or four&s;core miles.</P>
<P>The&s;e Mountains are not inhabited by any other thing but Lions, Tygers, Pan|thers, and &s;uch wild and ravenous Bea&s;ts as care not much for the &s;ociety of men. We had the &s;ight of many thou&s;ands of them in our way, and &s;aw the Roman Sports of their Theatres and Amphitheatres in the bot|toms, when we were on the &s;ide of the Hills; for there we met with the&s;e &s;urious Bea&s;ts contending for their prey. Two Bears were devouring an unhappy Deer, which by chance was by them &s;urpri&s;ed in Thicket or Bu&s;h of Brambles. They had no &s;ooner &s;eized upon it and overcome it, but in &s;teps the Lion to &s;hare in the &s;port. The two Bears would not allow him any part, therefore one &s;teps back to encounter him, whiles the other held the innocent Deer half dead; but the Lion being too &s;trong for the fir&s;t Bear, the &s;econd ran in
<PB N="6" REF="81">
to re&s;cue him with that fury, that made the Lion leave his hold. The fight la&s;ted about an hour, with &s;uch a variety of &s;port, that we could not pa&s;s on in our Journey, till we had &s;een the end. At la&s;t the Lion had &s;o bit+ten the Ma&s;ter-Bear by the legs, that he was &s;carce able to &s;tand; which when the Lion perceived, he retreated from him about an hundred paces, and then was too &s;trong for the other Bear, which had unadvi&s;edly pur+&s;ued him. After a &s;hort di&s;pute the Bear ran away, and left the Lion alone to his dinner with the lame Bear in &s;ight, which &s;ent to him many &s;narlings and wi&s;hful looks waiting till this King of Bea&s;ts had well &s;atisfied his appetite. But when the Lion had well filled his paunch with the Deer fle&s;h, and that he endeavoured to drag away the re&s;t, the two Bears &s;eeing his greedi+ne&s;s, gave the Lion another a&s;&s;ault, and obliged him to depart with a good piece of fle&s;h in his mouth, leaving the remainder to the hungry Bears that devoured all to the very Guts.</P>
<P>In pur&s;uance of our Journey we were carried over a high Mountain named <HI>Spora+kas;</HI> the top reaches to the &s;econd Region of the Air, and is always covered over with Snow and Ice in this hot Country. There
<PB N="7" REF="81">
is a very clear Fountain of water which yields a plentiful &s;tream running down the Rocks and Mountains of various a&s;cents, and by the fall and diver&s;ity of the noi&s;es and rumbling of the water, gives to the Pa&s;&s;engers a plea&s;ant Mu&s;ick. When I was within a mile of the place, I thought I had heard &s;ome Trumpets, Drums, and war like Harmony, Flutes and Hoboys, and &s;uch other windy and watry In&s;truments of Mu&s;ick. What! &s;aid I to <HI>Sermodas,</HI> what means this warlike Mu&s;ick that we hear? Is there not an Army coming before us? This que&s;tion cau&s;ed <HI>Sermodas</HI> and all the <HI>Sporvi</HI> to &s;mile. No, &s;aid <HI>Sermodas,</HI> we have no need to fight among&s;t our &s;elves, this Country is more free from all di&s;putes and contentions than any other under the Sun. We are not pinch'd with tho&s;e nece&s;&s;ities that are apt to make you <HI>Europeans</HI> &s;o mad and furious one again&s;t another. There is nothing of oppre&s;&s;ion or violence to be &s;een here. We are never a&s;&s;aulted by any Ene|my: All our Thieves, Robbers, and di&s;or|derly per&s;ons are confined to the skirts of our Dominions where they live to plague one another, but they are not &s;uffered to abid in the middle and bowels of the King|dom. Since <HI>Noahs</HI> Flood, whereof we
<PB N="8" REF="82">
have more certain Memoires than you in <HI>Europe,</HI> there was never any di&s;order nor War in this place, or in the Country round about, becau&s;e of the excellent Orders and u&s;eful Laws of this Country, which I &s;hall hereafter repre&s;ent to you. At the top of the Mountain we lodged in a Tent which Nature had prepared in a Diamant Rock, with &s;everal Apartments. The Rock &s;tood in a plain ground, as high as the great Steeple of <HI>Am&s;terdam.</HI> It occupied about an Acre of ground, having many tran&s;pa|rent Turrets round about at the middle of it. There was an entrance into it &s;o lumi|nous and glorious, that I thought the Sun had made here its abode, and that there was one within as well as without in the Heavens. In the fir&s;t room we re&s;ted our &s;elves, and unloaded our Unicorns. Some of the company gave them Provender, o|thers kindled us a fire; but <HI>Sermodas</HI> led me and <HI>Maurice</HI> by the hand to take a full view of this &s;tately Palace. When we had gone round, and &s;een the glory of it, and taken notice of the brightne&s;s of the Diamant with the cry&s;tal Turrets, and &s;teps by which men may climb up to the top, and which are made of Ice congealed and hardened into Cry&s;tal by length of time, we retur|ned
<PB N="9" REF="82">
to our company to take a &s;hare of the fire they had kindled; but we were no &s;ooner &s;ate down in the niches about the Wall, but out comes a Leopard followed by a wild Ma&s;ty from &s;ome inner rooms where they had been &s;leeping all the day. Now the noi&s;e of men had awakened them, and obliged them to &s;eek another more quiet retreat. The entrance was &s;topt with our Fardels and Goods to keep out the cold wind that blew in. When therefore we perceived them running and walking a|bout, we ran to our Arms to defend our &s;elves from their fury. But &s;tay, &s;aid <HI>Ser|modas</HI> to me, we need not &s;tir, you &s;hall &s;ee plea&s;ant &s;port, if you will &s;it quietly. He had no &s;ooner &s;poken the words, but the Leopard and the wild Ma&s;ty began to &s;a|lute one another with grim looks and fu|rious crys, which ended not without a &s;harp di&s;pute for ma&s;tery. Sometimes the one had the upper hand, anon the other would tread his Enemy under foot. They were &s;o furiou&s;ly &s;et one again&s;t another, that they took no notice of our being there, nor of the fire kindled in a corner, till two of our company, by the order of <HI>Sermodas,</HI> di&s;|charged two Guns upon them. The Bul|lets killed the Leopard, but the wild Dog
<PB N="10" REF="83">
retreated into the inner rooms; where he remainded till the next morning, that we fetched him out with fire, and di&s;patched him al&s;o. We were mightily afraid at their fir&s;t appearance; but when we per|ceived how little they regarded us, and how &s;peedily they fell foul of one another, we were well plea&s;ed with their company, for the room was large enough for them and us. <HI>Sermodas</HI> led us into every chamber, and corner of this Diamant Palace, where we had the &s;ight of all manner of Pro&s;pects and &s;napes of Bea&s;ts and Birds graven there with Natures finger to delight Pa&s;&s;engers when they pa&s;s over the&s;e rough Moun|tains into <HI>Sevaramb&eacute;.</HI> I &s;hall forbear from giving any exact De&s;cription of it, for fear this &s;trange account, incredible of it &s;elf, &s;hould injure the re&s;t of this Story, and cau&s;e my Reader to &s;u&s;pect the truth of all other pa&s;&s;ages of the&s;e Travels in this re|mote Country. The night we &s;pent in &s;uch plea&s;ant dreams, as made us <HI>Europeans</HI> to laugh heartily in our &s;leep. We fancied our &s;elves in a mo&s;t glorious Paradi&s;e, and were not willing to depart the next day. Had not <HI>Sermodas</HI> promi&s;ed to bring me back the &s;ame way, I had prevailed upon him to have &s;taid there a few nights, that
<PB N="11" REF="83">
we might have again a ta&s;te of our drow&s;ie delights, and of our imaginary happine&s;s, which to us was as good as any real and true.</P>
<P>I had almo&s;t forgot a Cu&s;tom ob&s;erved by all the crooked <HI>Sporvi,</HI> when they come to this place, to prepare them&s;elves to go down into the glorious and fruitful Vallies of <HI>Sevaramb&eacute;.</HI> They wa&s;h them&s;elves all over their bodies in a Mineral Fountain of a Water, which to the eye appears very yel|low, which Fountain &s;tands at a &s;tones ca&s;t from the Rock; and though the Air be cold, this Fountain is hot, and of an excel|lent virtue: for the Water clean&s;eth not only the filth of the body, but it hath that influence upon the humors of men, that they are freed from all tho&s;e extravagant de&s;ires of Lu&s;t and Lechery, which agrees not with the Air and Manners of the <HI>Seva|rambi.</HI> Before we went to &s;leep, <HI>Sermodas</HI> led me and my Companions out to this rare Fountain: Now, Captain, &s;aid he to me, &s;trip your &s;elf naked, and wa&s;h your &s;elf in this Water: with the&s;e words he &s;hewed me &s;everal corners, which &s;eemed to be made purpo&s;ely for men to bathe them|&s;elves and wa&s;h their bodies from the irre|gular inclinations of the&s;e other Regions.
<PB N="12" REF="84">
After we had well clean&s;ed our &s;elves, we returned to our Lodging, and after &s;upper <HI>Sermodas</HI> gave me this account of this Cu|&s;tom: Captain, &s;aid he to me, we are en|tring into a Climate where men are forced to be ab&s;temious again&s;t their wills; where if they harboured tho&s;e amorous affections which other men have, they meet with &s;o many and &s;uch powerful temptations, that they would be far more extravagant than the re&s;t of men, and be more deformed than any people; for the Air and nature of this Country is &s;uch, that it &s;ets a mark up|on all men that touch any other women than their own. And &s;uch Virgins as for|get them&s;elves, are &s;potted vi&s;ibly to the eyes of all beholders, as you &s;hall &s;ee when you come among&s;t them. For the preven|tion therefore of this and all other incon|veniencies which proceed from lu&s;tful ap|petites, we have a cu&s;tom to wa&s;h our &s;elves in this admirable Fountain, whereof the water hath that virtue to free us from tho&s;e lecherous inclinations as well as our bodies from filth, and to oblige us to ap|pear among&s;t the <HI>Sevarambi</HI> with a quiet and calm &s;pirit: &s;o that none or few dare joyn with any other female but his own. I inquired whether they had not a plurality
<PB N="13" REF="84">
allowed them: No, an&s;wered <HI>Sermodas,</HI> we in our Country have that allowance, and this cau&s;eth us all to be &s;o crooked in our bodies; for this &s;hape proceeds from the crookedne&s;s of our rea&s;on, which carries us to act and perform &s;uch things as agree not, I confe&s;s, with the excellency of our humane nature, but only with tho&s;e natural propen&s;ities, which we either by Art or re|&s;olution &s;hould re&s;train within the compa&s;s of a moderate appetite. But you are en|tring among&s;t the &s;obere&s;t people of the World, free from all tho&s;e wild pa&s;&s;ions which cau&s;e &s;o much di&s;turbance in other Lands. They are the perfecte&s;t and mo&s;t beautiful Ladies that ever you beheld, all their Country and all things therein are &s;tately, glorious, plea&s;ant, rich and noble, and &s;o extraordinarily full of innocent de|lights, that you would be content to abide there for ever.</P>
<P>This &s;hort account, with the many relations that we had already of this Country, inflamed our de&s;ires to be Eye|witne&s;&s;es of the&s;e rare things, and to injoy the &s;tately advantages that this place and Country afford. Therefore the next morning early we wa&s;hed and prepa|red our &s;elves for our Journey. But there
<PB N="14" REF="85">
happened an accident which retarded our Journey for a while. As &s;oon as our Uni|corns were loo&s;e and ready to be loaded, a Jaccal happened to run by in &s;ight of the&s;e Animals. As &s;oon as they perceived it, they ran after it &s;o &s;wiftly, that one of the foremo&s;t caught the Jaccal, and killed it: for there is a natural Antipathy between the&s;e two creatures, as there is between a Hare and a Grey-hound. At the fir&s;t &s;ight of a Jaccal it is not po&s;&s;ible to keep in the Unicorn, who is naturally carried to pur&s;ue this ravenous Bea&s;t. This gave us the trou|ble to run about a mile after them to the declive of the Hill, where the Unicorns were all dividing the &s;poils of the dead Jac|cal: one was tearing the tail, another was bu&s;ie about the Head, another was devour|ing the guts; they had all &s;hared it among&s;t them. When we had brought them back, we all mounted, and went on in our Jour|ney. About ten miles in our way, at the top of a very high &s;teep Hill, we &s;aw the great City of <HI>Sevarinde,</HI> and the beautiful Country where it is &s;ituate. Here the <HI>Sporvi</HI> are wont to perform certain Cere|monies before they dare venture farther; for they imagine, that if they neglected or contemned them, the Great Spirit of the
<PB N="15" REF="85">
Air, which governs in that Climate, would puni&s;h them with &s;ome &s;ignal token of his di&s;plea&s;ure, as he doth &s;uch as are given to Debauchery and Lechery. I and my Com|rades were all obliged to follow the &s;ame Cu&s;toms and Manners, for fear of giving offence, and for avoiding tho&s;e deformities and marks which are &s;aid to be inflicted upon all Contemners of the Laws of the Land.</P>
<P>In our Travelling we had the &s;ight of many &s;trange Creatures, Animals, Birds, and In&s;ects, whereof I knew not &s;o much as the name. The Trees in our Road were hung with Apes and Monkies: the Woods full of aromatick Trees and &s;weet Perfumes: the Mountains and Wilderne&s;&s;es were in|riched with Diamant Rocks and Banks of Cry&s;tal: the Rivers and Streams of Water are full of &s;andy Gold and precious Stones tran&s;parent. When I con&s;idered how rich and delightful a place the de&s;cent of the&s;e Mountains was, I judged that the Coun|try beyond, and the Bottoms and Vallies mu&s;t con&s;equently exceed all that I ever beheld on Earth. One thing I cannot o|mit: we &s;aw in our travelling a Beaver pur&s;ued and hunted by a Creature not much unlike in &s;hape to our Rabbets,

<P>In the way <HI>Sermodas</HI> gave me and my Companions &s;everal precautions how we &s;hould behave our &s;elves among&s;t the <HI>Seva|rites.</HI> Fir&s;t he advi&s;ed us to talk but little: For, &s;aid he, they are the wi&s;e&s;t of all men. If therefore you will gain any e&s;teem, or hinder your &s;elves from being de&s;pi&s;ed, ab|&s;tain from too much di&s;cour&s;e; for if they perceive, by a multiplicity of words, any indi&s;cretion in you, they will contemn you, and not think you worthy to abide in the Land, much le&s;s to be honoured by them. Again, take heed of &s;wearing, cur&s;ing, or damning; for &s;uch irregularities in lan|guage were never yet admitted into that Land. They &s;pue or bani&s;h out all di&s;or|derly per&s;ons, and confine them to the Bor|ders. Ob&s;erve next to do as you &s;ee other men, and take heed you be not &s;ingular in any practices: but when once you are ad|moni&s;hed by them, imitate them, and fol|low their good advices; for in &s;o doing, you will pre&s;erve your &s;elves in their e&s;teem, and &s;hew them re&s;pect. Ob&s;ti|nacy

and &s;ingularity are vices not known among&s;t them as they are among&s;t you <HI>Europeans.</HI> Take heed that you drink not too much of the delicious Wines of the Country, but u&s;e all things with ab&s;tinence and moderation. Refu&s;e not any gifts which they will be&s;tow upon you; for they are all noble and generous in their beha|viour and actions, and love not to &s;ee their favours &s;lighted by Strangers. I &s;hall, &s;aid <HI>Sermodas,</HI> inform you what to do, and give you other directions, as I &s;hall &s;ee occa&s;ion, that you may pa&s;s with credit through the Country of the <HI>Sevarambi.</HI> When he had ended his di&s;cour&s;e, we thanked him for his kindne&s;s, and promi&s;ed him our ready obe|dience to all that he &s;hould require from us. He &s;eemed to be well &s;atisfied with our compliance with him from the beginning. Thus we travelled along till we came to the foot of the&s;e high Mountains to the pa&s;&s;age of a large River three times bigger than the <HI>Danube</HI> or the <HI>Rhyne.</HI> It is called by the <HI>Sporvi Cocab,</HI> and by the <HI>Sevarambi Rocara.</HI> It runs at the bottom of the Hills, and incompa&s;&s;eth the Kingdom of the <HI>Se|varites</HI> almo&s;t round, till it meets with ano|ther large River, which together unite their &s;treams, and fall into the Pacifick Sea
<PB N="18" REF="87">
beyond the <HI>Streights</HI> of <HI>Magellan,</HI> about one hundred Leagues Southwards. At Sun|&s;etting we came to the banks of the River, but could not get over till the next day; for there is no Bridge &s;uffered to be made, becau&s;e the <HI>Sevarites</HI> are not willing to give &s;uch an ea&s;ie acce&s;s into their Country. They are afraid of two things, of the Vices of Strangers, and of their Di&s;ea&s;es, which cau&s;es them to &s;et Guards at the mouth of their Rivers, and all the ordinary Pa&s;&s;es, le&s;t a &s;udden Inva&s;ion &s;hould di&s;order their quiet and earthly tranquillity. This cau|&s;ed us to &s;top upon the &s;ides of the River till the morning; for the Boat which was to carry us over and our company, was then on the other &s;ide, and after Sun-&s;et there can no man be admitted into this happy Country: be&s;ides there are many things to be examined of Strangers before they can be received into the Boat. We lodged therefore all night at the foot of the Moun|tains in a beautiful Arbour or Bower of Je&s;mine mixed with Ro&s;e-trees, which in this place flouri&s;h and bear all the year long; for here neither Snow nor Fro&s;t is to be &s;een, nor &s;uch cruel winds as hinder the Fruits of the Earth. The Bower was about an hundred paces from &s;ide to &s;ide,
<PB N="19" REF="87">
&s;o that our Unicorns and Goods lay and re&s;ted with us in the &s;ame place all night. Whiles our Supper was providing, <HI>Sermodas</HI> took me and my Companions to walk with him near the Rivers &s;ide, and to di&s;cour&s;e with me about the Wonders of Nature, the delight&s;omne&s;s of the Pro&s;pect, the clearne&s;s of the River-water, the &s;weet harmony of the Evening-birds, the plea&s;ant noi&s;e of the Cry&s;tal-&s;treams, together with the comfor|table brie&s;es of Wind, which among&s;t the branches of the Che&s;tnut, Orange, Cedar, Elm, Oak, and other Trees, which here upon the &s;ides of the Mountains grow na|turally without planting, and promi&s;cuou&s;ly together, made &s;uch an Angelical Mu&s;ick, that we imagined our &s;elves in Paradi&s;e, and wonderfully contributed to our &s;ati&s;|faction in our Walk. <HI>Sermodas</HI> being in the middle of us, asked how we liked this abode: It is, replied <HI>Maurice,</HI> the mo&s;t glorious that I ever was in. You will &s;ee and know &s;omething more when you get over the River, and behold the excellency of tho&s;e things which are there confined. I asked him how it came to pa&s;s, that we in <HI>Europe</HI> were &s;o ignorant of this Country, and why this &s;hould excel all others. This que&s;tion, replied <HI>Sermodas,</HI> requires a long
<PB N="20" REF="88">
di&s;cour&s;e to give an an&s;wer to it; but I will not leave you without &s;ome &s;atisfacti|on. You mu&s;t know, that when <HI>Adam,</HI> the fir&s;t man, had offended his God by di&s;obe|dience, he &s;hut him out of the earthly Pa|radi&s;e, and would not &s;uffer him nor his wicked Po&s;terity to injoy the plea&s;ures of that plea&s;ant abode. They had liberty to inhabit round about, but for two thou&s;and years Paradi&s;e was guarded in &s;uch a man|ner, that none could enter into it all that time. Afterwards came the Flood, which turned and altered Mountains and Vallies; therefore we have &s;ome Records that tell us, that the earthly Paradi&s;e, which, during the old World, was in <HI>A&s;ia,</HI> was then tran&s;|ported hither, and all tho&s;e rare Trees, with the Jewels and Riches, were carried hither by Angels, and planted in this remote corner. And becau&s;e there was no man then fit to inhabit &s;o ble&s;&s;ed a place, of the Sons of <HI>Noah,</HI> a new couple were formed, not out of the &s;limy Earth as the former, but out of a purer and more delicate &s;ub|&s;tance, out of &s;ome Metal mixed with Gold and Silver: hence it is, that their bo|dies are &s;o clean, pure, glorious, and &s;plen|did as you &s;hall &s;ee. This couple, named <HI>Chericus</HI> and <HI>Salmoda,</HI> are the Parents of all
<PB N="21" REF="88">
the <HI>Sevarites;</HI> from their loins proceed the numbers of beautiful men and women, which you &s;hall &s;ee on the other &s;ide of the River. They had an hundred Sons and as many Daughters, and lived, by our Re|cords, two thou&s;and years; afterwards he was buried in the City of <HI>Sevarinde,</HI> where you &s;hall &s;ee his Sepulchre. When men and women began to increa&s;e, his elde&s;t Son <HI>Sevarias</HI> appointed Laws for men to govern their actions, and to avoid all kind of confu&s;ion. The&s;e Laws we can &s;hew you in our Regi&s;ters, &s;ub&s;cribed by all the men of tho&s;e days. In his time there hap|pened &s;ome Sons of <HI>Noah</HI> to be carried by the &s;tormy winds upon the&s;e Coa&s;ts. At their landing one of them met with a beau|tiful Virgin called <HI>Seri&s;&s;a,</HI> whom he ravi&s;h|ed and got with child. She brought forth Twins, a Boy named <HI>Bubo,</HI> and a Girl cal|led <HI>Chre&s;tona.</HI> The&s;e two being crooked, could not meet with Matches among&s;t the <HI>Sevarambi,</HI> who de&s;pi&s;ed them: Therefore when they came to the Age of thirty, they matched and increa&s;ed &s;trangely. When <HI>Sevarias</HI> our Law-giver &s;aw how numerous they were like to be, being a ju&s;t man, would not de&s;troy them, neither would he &s;uffer the pure Race of the <HI>Sevarambi</HI> to be
<PB N="22" REF="89">
defiled or mixed with the filthy Generati|ons of the other part of the World. He &s;ent a way <HI>Bubo</HI> and <HI>Chre&s;tona</HI> with their old <HI>European</HI> Father and their Mother <HI>Seri&s;&s;a,</HI> with all their Children and Grand-children to build the City of <HI>Sporunde,</HI> and to inha|bit the Country on this &s;ide the River, ap|pointing a certain Tribute for us to pay as an Acknowledgment that we are de&s;cend|ed partly from the &s;ame &s;tock: hence it is, that we are all &s;o deformed, and a little crooked, and that the true <HI>Sevarites</HI> will not be per&s;waded to joyn with us in Marriage, and yet they love us as brethren, and have a natural inclination for all men in general, which obliges them to be courteous, kind, affable, liberal, and bountiful to them all when they happen to fall into their hands. <HI>Sevarias</HI> our wi&s;e Law-giver appointed to us di&s;tinct Laws, and in &s;ome re&s;pects con|trary to the re&s;t of the <HI>Sevarites</HI> according to the crookedne&s;s of our <HI>European</HI> nature, which he &s;aw could not live up to that na|tural Sanctity which became us as men. He gave us therefore liberty to make the vile&s;t of our female Sex Slaves for our con|veniency in times of need, and in travelling up and down our Country; but &s;uch pra|ctices as the&s;e are not agreeable with the
<PB N="23" REF="89">
&s;trictne&s;s of the lives of the re&s;t of the <HI>Se|varambi,</HI> they abominate &s;uch mixtures; and though their Country inclines them as much as any to the fle&s;h, they cannot be per&s;waded to make u&s;e of it out of the rules and ways pre&s;cribed to them. And if at any time they forget them&s;elves by chance, the Air and Country is &s;o great an enemy to &s;uch practices, that it di&s;tingui&s;heth them from all the re&s;t by &s;ome vi&s;ible mark upon their No&s;es or Foreheads, which cau|&s;eth them to be immediately bani&s;hed out of the Country to the Confines over ano|ther River on the other &s;ide of the King|dom, where they have the liberty to live deprived of all the plea&s;ures of this earthly Paradi&s;e. Thither are confined all the di&s;|orderly per&s;ons, the lecherous, the filthy, and ba&s;e, each &s;ort have their di&s;tinct pla|ces of abode, or I&s;lands from whence they are not &s;uffered to depart till they dye na|turally: For our wi&s;e and ever glorious Law-giver commanded us not to put men to death for any mi&s;take, forgetfulne&s;s, or mi&s;carriage of their lives. Killing is per|mitted by our Laws only in defence of our own per&s;ons; all other Offenders again&s;t the Municipal Laws of the Land are bani|&s;hed to the Borders, where they live to re|pent

them of their wickedne&s;s, and mo&s;t times dye good men. I &s;hall give you a farther account of the excellent Laws and Manners of the <HI>Sevarites,</HI> when we &s;hall be on the other &s;ide among&s;t them; for they will not be per&s;waded to venture over into the&s;e parts, for fear of infecting them&s;elves with Foreign Cu&s;toms and Manners, and the vicious Air, which is every where but in <HI>Sevaramb&eacute;.</HI> But, Captain, &s;aid <HI>Sermo|das</HI> to me, when we had walked about a mile from our Company, it is time for us to vi&s;it them again, for yonder comes a furi|ous Company down the Mountains, which will force us to a retreat. I looked and &s;aw a Party of Jaccals followed by two old Lions and &s;ome young ones running apace towards us, howling as if they had been mad: hunger makes them more furious and greedy than otherwi&s;e they would be; for they increa&s;e &s;o fa&s;t, that in the Woods and Retreats there is not &s;ufficient food for them all to fill their Paunches every day. Towards the dawning of the day they bur&s;t out of their Caves and Holes to &s;eek their nece&s;&s;ary provi&s;ions for them and their young ones. The foremo&s;t were not above an hundred paces from us, when they fir&s;t declared their coming with fearful
<PB N="25" REF="90">
out-crys, which were &s;igns to the Lions round about, that they had di&s;covered &s;ome prey. We were then without Weapon, and never dreamed of any danger in &s;o plea&s;ant an abode. All the wild Bea&s;ts under&s;tood the Alarm of their fore-runners, and ha&s;ted to the place where the Jaccals had made a noi&s;e. A mixture of all &s;orts followed them clo&s;e at the heels, Lions, Bears, Tygers, Elks, Leopards, and &s;ome other &s;orts which I &s;hall hereafter de&s;cribe. It was not time for us to &s;tay there any longer, and &s;ee our danger ha&s;ten upon us. We took our &s;elves to our heels, and ran with <HI>Sermodas</HI> towards our Bower, where all the <HI>Sporvi</HI> had put them&s;elves in a po&s;ture of defence as &s;oon as they heard the noi&s;e. But we could not make &s;uch ha&s;te, but one of the foremo&s;t Leopards caught <HI>Maurice</HI> by the Coat, and tore off a piece, which the furious bea&s;t de|voured, and gave him time to e&s;cape; ano|ther bit me by the Buttocks, and held me &s;o fa&s;t, that I could not get away from him. In the mean while all my Company run be|fore, every one &s;hifting for him&s;elf. I thought my &s;elf lo&s;t, but I was re&s;olved to &s;truggle for my life. The le&s;s hopes I &s;aw of e&s;caping, becau&s;e &s;everal Companies of other ravenous Bea&s;ts were near at hand. I
<PB N="26" REF="91">
turned therefore my &s;elf and pulled the Leopard by the Ears, thru&s;ting one of my fingers into his right Eye. The pain forced him to let go his hold, which as &s;oon as he had done, he leaped upon me with his open Jaws, into which I thru&s;t my right hand and took hold of the Tongue, nece&s;&s;ity adding more &s;trength to my Arm, I pluckt it by the root whiles the bea&s;t held me with his Paws. At that in&s;tant &s;ix roaring Lions, and three Bears, with an infinite number of Jaccals, had overtaken and &s;urrounded me, but none offered to touch me. I flung among&s;t them the Leopards tongue, which they all greedily catched at with a &s;hort di&s;pute, which of them &s;hould have it. This gave me lei&s;ure to run about a dozen paces from them before they had ended it. As &s;oon as a Lion had taken it for his &s;hare, the re&s;t fell foul upon the Leopard, which was become &s;o trouble&s;om to them, becau&s;e of his extraordinary howling, that they minded me not &s;o much, only an old Bear made after me, and overtook me. When I &s;aw <HI>Sermodas</HI> and <HI>Maurice,</HI> and all the Company ha&s;tening with Weapons to my re&s;cue, their &s;ight and coming gave me &s;ome hopes of e&s;caping out of the Jaws of an unavoidable death. The Bear gal|lopped
<PB N="27" REF="91">
after me, and was ju&s;t at my very heels, when I &s;tumbled and fell flat on my face, the Bears fury cau&s;ed him to run about a dozen paces beyond me over my body, before it could &s;top; then were <HI>Ser|modas, Maurice,</HI> and all the re&s;t come in with their Guns, and other Weapons, and one for my &s;elf. As &s;oon as I had got a Sword in my hand, I ran at the Bear, and wounded the bea&s;t in the right Thigh at the fir&s;t blow, but at the &s;econd I thru&s;t it in at the brea&s;t, and wounded him at the heart. In the mean while all our Compa|ny were not idle, they fell upon the wild Bea&s;ts with their Swords and Halberts in their hands, and killed in a &s;hort time twenty Lions, thirteen Bears, and forty Jaccals, with three&s;core other &s;ort of fu|rious and ravenous Creatures. We found dead the next day one like a Bull with &s;ix Horns, two &s;mall ones a little above the No&s;e, two a little bigger under the Eyes, and two great ones upon his Head. This bea&s;t is called <HI>Suja,</HI> and lives upon the &s;poils of other Animals. We &s;aw another having a Head like a Lion, a Skin like a Crocodile, and a Tail as a Fox as red as blood, the Claws were bent in, but when they were &s;tretched out, they were about a
<PB N="28" REF="92">
foot long, and as &s;harp as Needles. <HI>Sermo|das</HI> told me, that this was the mo&s;t furious bea&s;t in all the World; for nothing can e&s;cape out of its Jaws and Claws, it tears in pieces all that it meets with, and were it not that it hath but a &s;mall appetite, it would devour all the Lions of the Woods. He told me, that the <HI>Sporvi</HI> called it <HI>Forabab,</HI> and that there are no Females of them to be found, becau&s;e they are begot by a mix|ture of Lions and other Animals which co|pulate together. We killed two other bea&s;ts as big as ordinary Ma&s;ties, but &s;o extraordinary furious, that none are to be compared to them. We continued the &s;laughter near two hours, re&s;cuing one ano|ther when the wild bea&s;ts were too hard for any of us, and had wor&s;ted us. The re&s;t we put to flight, having wounded mo&s;t of them: three of the <HI>Sporvi</HI> in our company were bit in their Limbs, and &s;ix of us run through the Arm with the Claws of the Lions. After this fierce Encounter, which was not above three &s;tones ca&s;t from our Bower, we went, very joyful to have e&s;caped the danger, to refre&s;h our &s;elves with a good Supper of Roa&s;t meat and Fruit, which was ready prepared for us. <HI>Sermodas</HI> embraced me and <HI>Maurice,</HI> ex|pre&s;&s;ing
<PB N="29" REF="92">
much joy for our e&s;cape out of this great danger, becau&s;e none of us had been devoured by the&s;e furious Inhabitants of the Woods. After Supper he walked into the Air, and met with a Shrub tree upon the bank of the River, called <HI>Mezola,</HI> he took a &s;tick from it, and rubbed the Wound of my Buttocks, and before the morning I was perfectly cured of my Wounds, as all the re&s;t of the men hurt by the bea&s;ts: For had he not applied this to our Wounds, we &s;hould have been lame, and hindred thereby from pa&s;&s;ing over the River into <HI>Sevarambe.</HI> We laid our &s;elves down up|on the Banks and Beds of Earth made un|der the Bower for Strangers to re&s;t them|&s;elves, and &s;lept all night, only we were interrupted by the howlings of &s;trange Creatures and bea&s;ts of prey, who ranged about the Bower, attempting to enter in, but we had &s;topt the pa&s;&s;ages and ways, &s;o that there was no entrance for any of them.</P>
<P>The next morning a large Boat was on this &s;ide to carry us over with five grave Signiors, two came to our Bower to call to us before we were up, and vi&s;it us. The chief Owner of the Boat was named <HI>Kibbus.</HI> As &s;oon as we heard them we ro&s;e and
<PB N="30" REF="93">
dre&s;&s;ed our &s;elves. <HI>Sermodas</HI> went out to give <HI>Kibbus</HI> an account of our per&s;ons and misfortunes: which when he had under|&s;tood, he entred in with him, and took us by the hand and ki&s;&s;ed us, bidding us be of good chear, and that his Prince would be joyful to &s;ee us. We went with him to &s;ee the &s;laughter of the wild bea&s;ts which we &s;tripped of their skins, becau&s;e the <HI>Se|varambi</HI> are great Lovers of Furs; and this was a noble Pre&s;ent, which we intended to give to their King. As &s;oon as we had di&s;patched our bu&s;ine&s;s, <HI>Kibbus</HI> with his Companions called us one after another to ask us, whether we had any infirmities or di&s;temper in our bodies: after this he cau|&s;ed us to wa&s;h in a Fountain hard by, and gave us green Gowns, which he had in his Boat on purpo&s;e for all Travellers, butto|ned before with rich Buttons of Ja&s;per &s;tones. They were perfumed in &s;uch an ex|traordinary manner, that I never &s;aw the like. After this and &s;ome previous Cere|monies, we were admitted with our Uni|corns into his wide and large Boat, and in an in&s;tant we were carried over to a &s;mall Town, where I beheld the mo&s;t beautiful men and women of the World. They all knowing us to be Strangers, of a Foreign
<PB N="31" REF="93">
Country, went to the banks of the River to &s;alute and welcome us. At the head of them was a grave Gentleman with ruddy cheeks, and a comely countenance, and a long beard of bright hair, which in the Sun &s;hined as if they had been of gold: he was attended upon by &s;ix mo&s;t beautiful tall young Men, who were followed by four of the female Sex, whom I cannot liken to any but to Angels: they &s;urpa&s;&s;ed all that lever beheld with my eyes on Earth. The&s;e were his Children. They took <HI>Maurice</HI> and my &s;elf by the hand, asked of our welfare and Country, and &s;poke to us in very good French. I was glad to meet in &s;o remote a place a man that &s;poke that Language, I de&s;ired to know his Name: My Name, &s;aid he, is <HI>Zidi Marbet.</HI> All the re&s;t of the Town did him Obei&s;ance when he pa&s;&s;ed by them; for he was a man of great Riches and Authority, and of an excellent Memo|ry and Wit. <HI>Sermodas</HI> had &s;ome private di&s;cour&s;e with him near the River; after|wards he marched with us into his Town to his Palace, the mo&s;t glorious thing that I ever beheld, and yet that was nothing to what I &s;aw afterwards. The Town lay up|on the banks of the River, and had &s;ix uni|form Streets abutting to the Water. The
<PB N="32" REF="94">
Hou&s;es were for the mo&s;t part built all of white and black Marble, very curious to the eye: they were covered over with a &s;hining Slate, which &s;eemed to be gilt with Gold before every door. In a wide empty place grew &s;everal aromatick and excellent rare Trees for plea&s;ure and profit. We all admired to &s;ee the place, &s;ometimes we &s;tood a&s;toni&s;hed at the beauty of the men and women, anon we were ravi&s;hed with the glorious and delight&s;om abodes. Where|ever we ca&s;t our eyes, we &s;aw nothing but that which de&s;erved our wonder and admi|ration. <HI>Zidi Marbet</HI> walked with us with his company, and led us to his Palace, which excelled all the other hou&s;es in beauty. At our entrance we &s;aw two Po&s;ts of pure Ivo|ry, ring'd round with Gold, with a little Court paved with white and black Marble. The Hou&s;e was built almo&s;t in the &s;ame manner as the re&s;t, but &s;urrounded with the mo&s;t beautiful Trees, and moted with a Draw-bridge of black Wood like Ebeny, having Chains of Gold in&s;tead of Iron. In the Water the Fi&s;h were in &s;uch plenty, and &s;o great, that we &s;aw hundreds as we pa&s;&s;ed by. At our fir&s;t entrance we &s;tood in a+maze to behold the glory of the in&s;ide, we could not &s;ufficiently admire the beauty

and &s;plendor of the rich Moveables, the Hangings and Tapi&s;try over-laid with Gold and precious Stones, with all other things which can never be believed, if I &s;hould offer to relate them. Here we &s;topped &s;e|ven days, till we had News from <HI>Sevarinde,</HI> whither we had &s;ent word of our Arrival, to know the Kings Plea&s;ure. In the mean while I cannot expre&s;s the delights which were given to every day; the &s;weet Con|certs of Mu&s;ick, the plea&s;ant Walks about the Town, the Recreations of Hunting, Fi&s;hing, Hawking, and other Sports, were not wanting to us, with many other Pa&s;t|times. <HI>Zidi Marbet</HI> and his whole Family were extraordinary civil to us. The Town were not wanting in their re&s;pects.</P>
<P>At the end of &s;even days, <HI>Sermodas</HI> our Guide, with the re&s;t of our Company, &s;et forward towards <HI>Sevarinde,</HI> where we ar|rived in &s;ix days. The Journey was the mo&s;t plea&s;ant that ever I had been in. There was &s;carce any manner of Recrea|tion or innocent Plea&s;ure belonging to our bodies, but we found it in the way. All our &s;en&s;es were ravi&s;hed with their de|lights; the Ears with the &s;weet Harmony and Tunes of all manner of Singing-birds, with the grateful Crys of all &s;orts of Crea|tures:
<PB N="34" REF="95">
our Eyes beheld all the mo&s;t glorious Sights which are to be &s;een in all the Earth: the Fields, the Towns, and Cities, the Woods, the Vallies, and Mountains refre&s;h|ed our Eye-&s;ight with new objects of plea|&s;ure and wonder at every moment: our No&s;es met with the rare&s;t Perfumes; every Bu&s;h and corner yielded to us new delights of this kind. For our Ta&s;te we had every where &s;uch Dainties and rare Wines, that are not to be expre&s;&s;ed. One thing I took great notice of, That all tho&s;e Creatures which are el&s;ewhere, are to be &s;een in this earthly Paradi&s;e; as Lions, Bears, Wolves, Jaccals, &amp;c. and tame bea&s;ts, as Sheep, Cows, Camels, Oxen, Hor&s;es, &amp;c. but they are not of the &s;ame nature, as el&s;ewhere. The wild bea&s;ts, as &s;oon as they &s;wim over the River of <HI>Rocara,</HI> lo&s;e all their fierce di&s;|po&s;itions, and become as harmle&s;s and mild as Lambs; for they feed upon gra&s;s and In&s;ects, without offering to meddle with any living Animal. Likewi&s;e they, as well as the tame bea&s;ts, have another cry, not &s;o har&s;h and unplea&s;ant, as every where el&s;e. Their crys are more grateful to the ear. All things, in a word, are &s;o ordered, as if they were purpo&s;ely intended to delight and increa&s;e the plea&s;ure of the Inhabitants
<PB N="35" REF="95">
We &s;aw in our Journey many &s;trange birds and tame bea&s;ts, not to be &s;een in any other part of the World. The Fields almo&s;t in every place are watered with fre&s;h Streams and Chanels, full of all manner of fre&s;h water fi&s;h: &s;o that in every Town and Village we &s;aw many Fi&s;h-ponds incompa&s;|&s;ed about with the rare&s;t Trees in Nature. The ground is &s;o extraordinary fruitful, that it is ordinary for them to gather three or four Crops every year of &s;everal forts of grain. So that it is no wonder, if men and creatures are here &s;o numerous. Every two miles we met with a good Town in our way, &s;ome more, &s;ome le&s;s glorious than the re&s;t; but built &s;o regular and uni|form, that I judged that the&s;e <HI>Sevarites</HI> were not ignorant of the humane Sciences and Arts, which are imperfectly known in other parts of the World. <HI>Sermodas</HI> infor|med me, that for Philo&s;ophy, the Mathe|maticks, A&s;trology, and the re&s;t, they were all trained up in them from their youth. They chiefly excel in all delightful Sciences and Arts, as Mu&s;ick and the Mathematicks. Every Child about fourteen years of age can play upon all manner of In&s;truments, with that dexterity and nimblene&s;s, that I have often wondered to look upon them, and
<PB N="36" REF="96">
hear &s;uch ravi&s;hing Tunes and Airs, which our Mu&s;icians are not acquainted with. They are not much skill'd in Phy&s;ick, nor in tho&s;e Arts, which mens Vices and Di&s;ea&s;es cau&s;e the <HI>Europeans</HI> to inquire in|to; for &s;eldom any di&s;temper &s;eizeth up|on them, till they fall away with old age, and drop into their graves. I never &s;aw any deformity among&s;t them, but &s;uch va|riety of Beauties both in men and women, that we were all ravi&s;hed to look upon them. The&s;e Beauties in the female Sex were not pitiful and effeminate, as among&s;t our women; but accompanied with a great deal of Maje&s;ty, Mode&s;ty, and Gravity to|gether. It is not po&s;&s;ible to in&s;tance all the &s;everal particulars and in&s;tances of their beauty; for there was as great a variety in that excellency of the body, as there is a variety and diver&s;ity in the deformity of ours in <HI>Europe. Sermodas</HI> entertained us in our Road with many delightful and &s;a|tisfying Stories concerning the&s;e <HI>Sevarites.</HI> But I intend to repre&s;ent them in the &s;e|veral Chapters or Heads unto which they properly belong.</P>
<P>We had in our Journey a &s;ight of many Eagles and Vultures; but I was told, that they prey upon nothing but In&s;ects: and
<PB N="37" REF="96">
for venemous creatures, there are none to be found. They know not what it is to live always in fear, to be poy&s;oned by A&s;ps, Scorpions, Snakes, or to be devoured by flying Serpents and Crocodiles, which in other Kingdoms &s;wallow man and bea&s;t. So that in all re&s;pects this Country is the hap|pie&s;t, the mo&s;t plea&s;ant, and abounds with &s;o many nece&s;&s;aries to the life of man, that it is not po&s;&s;ible to imagine any thing more.</P>
<P>We &s;aw many Diamant Rocks in our way, with which the Inhabitants imbelli&s;h their Hou&s;es. We &s;aw &s;ome Rocks of Ja|&s;per, of Sardonyx, of Beryl, and Emerald; for Gold and Silver and Bra&s;s, they find the&s;e Metals, but rough, as plentifully as we do in other Countries, &s;tones. But as they never make u&s;e of Money, they re&s;ine the Gold for no other purpo&s;e but to adorn them&s;elves and their Dwellings, and for other civil u&s;es. Silver they have in great a|bundance, and Bra&s;s much more ea&s;ie to be purified than ours in <HI>Europe</HI> or <HI>America,</HI> be|cau&s;e Nature being hotter and more power|ful, performs that in the bo&s;om of the Earth which belongs to our Refiners to do, and fits the Metal for their u&s;e with a &s;mall al|teration and labour. All manner of pre|cious
<PB N="38" REF="97">
Stones are to be found here in the High-ways, in &s;uch abundance, that had our Merchants liberty to trade into the&s;e parts, they would bring down the price of Jewels, that they would not be looked upon as they are for &s;uch rich Commodities. The Cattle and the Sheep here are far bigger and better than ours, and all their tame bea&s;ts; but when they want any thing, they exchange with one another: and if they are not able to purcha&s;e it in that manner, they have all that great love and affection for one another, that they never deny things that may benefit the publick Society, or any of the <HI>Sevarites.</HI> There is among&s;t them &s;o much love, &s;incerity, good corre&s;pondence, that no Nation hath the like be&s;ides them&s;elves. Hence it is, that poverty and want are not known among&s;t them. They are great Lovers of Ho&s;pita|lity, and &s;trive to excel one another in this Vertue. An Example of this we had in our way to <HI>Sevarinde;</HI> for in a great Town, named <HI>Buba&s;ti,</HI> ten of the Chief men con|tended with one another in civil manner to have us to lodge at their hou&s;es, which I may ju&s;tly call Palaces: and to content them all we were forced to divide our+&s;elves, and to accept of all their kindne&s;&s;es
<PB N="39" REF="97">
neither could we get away from them in a day, they had &s;o many new inventions and Recreations to retard us till the Eve|ning, and then they would not &s;uffer us to depart till the next morning.</P>
<P>Our fir&s;t &s;tage was at <HI>Foralar,</HI> thirty miles from the River, where we met with Excellencies and Riches beyond all belief and imagination. The next was <HI>Fu&s;tad,</HI> a|bout five and thirty miles from <HI>Foralar.</HI> The third was <HI>Brobas,</HI> a large City well walled, and &s;o glorious to the eye when the Sun &s;hines, that it dazles it. The fourth night we reached as far as <HI>Crocarambe.</HI> The fifth we entred into <HI>Buba&s;ti:</HI> And the &s;ixth day about noon we were received and welcomed into <HI>Sevarinde.</HI> As &s;oon as we were arri|ved and entred into the Palace appointed for our abode, men and women of all &s;orts, but of rare and compleat beauty, came in to welcome us, bringing with them of the Fruits of the Country. Among&s;t them a party of Mu&s;icians, a dozen in number en|tred the Hall, where we were refre&s;hing our &s;elves, and admiring all the Excellen|cies before our eyes, and the Divine Beauty of tho&s;e incarnate Angels, the Women of that place. <Q>At the fir&s;t they &s;aluted us with a &s;hort Speech to this purpo&s;e in their

You &s;hall &s;ee by experience the Genero+&s;ity and brave minds of the <HI>Sevarambi.</HI> We rejoyce to have an occa&s;ion of imitating our bountiful God, and expre&s;s our Libe+ralities to his Creatures, and our kindne&s;s to men, though of another World and Parentage. This brings me and my Com+panions into this place, and at this time to mitigate your &s;orrows, and cau&s;e you to forget your &s;hipwrack and calamity&punc; With the&s;e words he made a grave bow and nodded to the re&s;t of his Comrades and immediately the Mu&s;ick began to play &s;o &s;weetly, that we reckoned our &s;elves in Heaven, and not upon Earth.</Q> This Sport continued about two hours with an inter+ruption of other Sports. We ta&s;ted there al&s;o &s;ome of the mo&s;t delicious Wines of the World; they grow not as ours upon &s;hrubs and &s;hort &s;tumps, but upon great Trees as high as the Cedar and Oak-trees neither have they any trouble with them

to manure or cut them, for the Wine-tree brings forth of its own accord plentifully. In an Orchard of the&s;e kinds of Trees about the compa&s;s of an Acre, they have &s;ome|times ten Tun of this rare Wine, as clear as Cry&s;tal, but &s;o extraordinary &s;trong and plea&s;ant, that the <HI>Vin de la Cindad</HI> of <HI>Paris,</HI> nor the Rheni&s;h, nor Frontiniack, nor <HI>Flo|rence,</HI> nor Canary, nor any other &s;orts of Wine of <HI>A&s;ia,</HI> or <HI>Europe</HI> are to be com|pared to this Divine Nectar, which &s;o re|fre&s;hes Nature, and &s;trengthens the body, that the olde&s;t per&s;ons in that Country &s;eem to be but young. Their age is di&s;co|verable only by their grey hairs and long beards, which they are not to cut by the Law of the Land. That evening <HI>Sevarminas</HI> &s;ent us a Me&s;&s;enger to know of our welfare, advi&s;ing us to prepare our &s;elves for the next morning to wait upon him, for he was very de&s;irous to &s;ee us. <HI>Sermodas</HI> had been with him, and had given him an account of us, and of our behaviour &s;ince our landing in <HI>Sporumb&egrave;,</HI> and our entrance in <HI>Sevaramb&eacute;.</HI> At his return to us, after Supper we de&s;ired him to give us an exact account of the ex|tent of the Dominions of his King <HI>Sevar|minas,</HI> and of the further mo&s;t bounds of his Empire. In an&s;wer to your reque&s;t, &s;aid
<PB N="42" REF="99">
<HI>Sermodas</HI> to us, I mu&s;t tell you, That we have now a Prince called <HI>Sevarminas,</HI> li|neally de&s;cended from our wi&s;e Law-giver <HI>Sevarias:</HI> this is the &s;eventh thou&s;and five hundred and ninth King, who hath &s;ince that time reigned in this Land. His Go|vernment between the Rivers are three|&s;core and five Principalities: the chief are <HI>Ro&s;taki</HI> in the We&s;t, <HI>Shaf&s;tati</HI> on the North towards the Pacifick Sea, <HI>Roblati</HI> on the Ea&s;t, and <HI>Mana&s;ti</HI> on the South. The&s;e are the four principal Parts of the Kingdom com|manded by four chief Officers, who are to have an in&s;pection over the other le&s;&s;er Di|vi&s;ions. The&s;e wait upon <HI>Sevarminas,</HI> and are of his Privy Council. The other Chief|tains are to re&s;ide in their &s;everal Princi|palities, and take care to do Ju&s;tice, and puni&s;h all Offenders with Bani&s;hment to their &s;everal places appointed for their re|treat. Be&s;ides the&s;e Juri&s;dictions within the Rivers, there are &s;everal other places belonging to <HI>Sevarminas,</HI> which acknow|ledge him for their Supreme Lord; but they are full of all bani&s;hed men, Offenders of the Law, and Malefactors. There is the Province of the <HI>Sporvi,</HI> which you have &s;een already, commanded by the Noble <HI>Al|bicormas:</HI> the next to us is the I&s;land of the
<PB N="43" REF="99">
Fornicators, whom the&s;e <HI>Sevarambi</HI> cannot endure. The&s;e all appear with their rotten No&s;es and poy&s;oned Faces, &s;o that they are a&s;hamed to &s;hew them&s;elves among&s;t per|fect men. They live in Woods and dark Caves, men and women promi&s;cuou&s;ly, with|out any regard to their hone&s;ty, which they have had no care to pre&s;erve. They have an ill-favour'd old Hag for their Governe&s;s, a filthy Bawd, named <HI>Bru&s;tana.</HI> Their Coun|try affords them many good things, &s;o that they live without much labour; but are &s;o deformed and infectious, that none dares venture among&s;t them, who hath any re|gard to the &s;afety of his own per&s;on or Honour. When among&s;t the <HI>Sevarites</HI> any, either man or woman, breaks the Law by any &s;uch fle&s;hly liberty, they are imme|diately &s;ent over and landed there, from whence they cannot po&s;&s;ibly return, becau&s;e there is no Boat dares carry them from thence. In this place they have a freedom to do what they li&s;t, and to plea&s;e them|&s;elves with the choice of per&s;ons of their own di&s;po&s;ition and temper without any re&s;traint. The next Province is that of the Knaves, a cunning &s;ort of men, who are all upon catches, continually plotting the mi&s;chief of others. When there is the
<PB N="44" REF="100">
lea&s;t &s;u&s;picion of any &s;uch per&s;on in a Pro|vince of the <HI>Sevarites,</HI> they never leave till they have found him out, and &s;ent him to this place, where he is commanded by <HI>Ma|rabo:</HI> when any excels in Knavery, he is there promoted in his Court to Offices of Honour and Tru&s;t. The&s;e have the large&s;t and be&s;t Province belonging to <HI>Sevarminas</HI> beyond the River; for they are numerous and increa&s;e daily in number of men and in Lands towards the South. They di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ed another Generation of covetous Ra&s;cals, who had been bani&s;hed from among the <HI>Sevarambi,</HI> and had laid great improvement upon their Lands, having built many good Towns and Cities. When the Knaves, their Neighbours, had under&s;tood it, they caught it from them, and drove them out of it by a Trick, &s;ending the Covetous to live in their Country empty of Inhabitants. The next is the Province of di&s;orderly per&s;ons troubled with the di&s;tempers of di&s;content, fury, ambition, and other Vices. <HI>Sevarmi|nas</HI> is forced to keep a Guard upon their Borders, and to place next to them the &s;toute&s;t and mo&s;t warlike &s;ouls, for fear of a &s;udden irruption. There are thirteen other large Provinces filled with other kind of men; but I forbear to &s;peak of them
<PB N="45" REF="100">
till I &s;hall give you an account of an attempt which the bordering Provinces made once to di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;s King <HI>Sevarminas</HI> of his Throne, and to &s;eize upon the Territories of the un&s;potted <HI>Sevarites,</HI> who were forced to arm them&s;elves, and drive tho&s;e di&s;orderly Villains into their own Ne&s;ts, where they are now confined. Since that time care hath been taken to build &s;uch Walls and Forts, as that they cannot now ea&s;ily pa&s;s over to trouble the Peace of the <HI>Sevarites.</HI> I had almo&s;t forgotten to &s;peak of the large Province of Fools, which lies directly South from <HI>Sevarind&eacute;.</HI> If any per&s;on, by a mi&s;chance, becomes crack-brain'd or di|&s;temper'd with any kind of folly, he is con|demned to be tran&s;ported to the I&s;land of <HI>Cracos,</HI> where he is to &s;pend all his days in what Exerci&s;es plea&s;e him be&s;t. The Country affords him all Nece&s;&s;aries with|out pains: therefore the Fools lead a plea|&s;ant life in the Woods and Medows. Be|fore we go out of the Kingdom, I will, &s;aid <HI>Sermodas,</HI> beg leave of <HI>Sevarminas</HI> to have a Guard, and vi&s;it the Provinces of Knaves and Fools, where you &s;hall &s;ee &s;uch Tricks and Sports, as you never &s;aw the like. And if you de&s;ire to vi&s;it any other part of the Kingdom, I will de&s;ire leave from our
<PB N="46" REF="101">
mighty King, who will take care to pro|vide for your &s;afety in going and coming. For though in this happy Paradi&s;e there is nothing of evil, all things are an&s;werable to the excellent and kind nature of the In|habitants; yet round about the Borders in the adjoyning I&s;lands and Provinces, there is as much Di&s;turbance, War, Tumult, and Unquietne&s;s, as in any part of your Northern World; for the <HI>Sevarambi</HI> have a Law to &s;end thither all tho&s;e per&s;ons who de&s;ire to cau&s;e any alteration in their Government or Manners, or who live not according to the &s;trict Rules which they have received from their Forefathers, and which by no means they will be per&s;waded to change. Some of the&s;e bani&s;hed men, after a certain number of years, and a vi&s;ible &s;ign of Re|formation, have leave to return, and to be admitted again among&s;t the <HI>Sevarambi;</HI> but others are &s;o unquiet and unruly, that they are a trouble to them&s;elves, and all that are concerned with them. There|fore our Princes and Governors will not admit them again, for fear they &s;hould re|lap&s;e into the &s;ame evils, and di&s;turb this Kingdom, which for many thou&s;and years hath continued in peace and pro&s;perity without alteration by the excellent Laws
<PB N="47" REF="101">
of our Great and wi&s;e <HI>Sevarias,</HI> the fir&s;t Monarch of this happy Land. Hence it is, that we never have any change of chief Governours or Governments, every one knows his duty, his place and abilities, and is fully &s;atisfied with the advantages that he expects from thence. Here is no op|pre&s;&s;ion nor violence, the lea&s;t inclination of that unnatural di&s;po&s;ition &s;ends men away to the Borders to prevent future mi&s;|chiefs. Neither have the <HI>Sevarites</HI> that wicked cu&s;tom of coining Money, and buy|ing and &s;elling all things with money, the root of all Northern evils. They will not admit of any &s;uch weed to grow in this Land, but things are exchanged for one another. And you have &s;een &s;ince your entrance, there is &s;o great an abundance of all good things, that men mu&s;t be lovers of wickedne&s;s, that can be evil in the mid&s;t of &s;uch a plenty of goodne&s;s where it over|flows. But I mu&s;t tell you, &s;aid <HI>Sermodas,</HI> of one thing more, which cau&s;eth us to continue in peace: we are not &s;ubject to the wicked attempts and temptations of any evil Spirit, as you are in the Northern World. Tho&s;e dangerous Imps care not to vi&s;it this Southern part; for they have been &s;o often caught in the &s;nares here, that they
<PB N="48" REF="102">
dread the very &s;ight of the <HI>Sevarites,</HI> or of their Country. You, I under&s;tand, in the Northern parts lay mo&s;t of your mi&s;car|riages at the Devils door, who hath a room in many of your habitations, and a dwel|ling in every place and corner; but we are altogether free from his company and tem|ptations. Sometimes it is true, he &s;ends &s;ome loo&s;e Devils to debauch a few indi&s;|creet per&s;ons, but then we &s;end them away immediately to their proper places with the Fiend in their company. <HI>But,</HI> &s;aid <HI>Mau|rice, how can you keep the Devils out of your Land?</HI> They fly in the empty Air, and go by night as well as by day. <HI>Sermodas</HI> an|&s;wered, Our eyes are better than yours, but the <HI>Sevarites</HI> of all men have the mo&s;t refined &s;en&s;es. They can &s;ee when the Spirits come among&s;t them; for this pur|po&s;e there is a con&s;tant Guard kept in all the u&s;ual Roads upon the Borders of the <HI>Sevarites,</HI> four hundred Con&s;pirers, if I may &s;o call them, are kept in con&s;tant Pay to drive away the Devil with Spells, when he ventures to approach upon the Borders. They have a particular Art to command the evil Spirits, which no man knows but them&s;elves. It is true, &s;ome of the peep|ing and cra&s;ty Ra&s;cals creep into this Land
<PB N="49" REF="102">
through by ways out of the u&s;ual Roads; but when the <HI>Sevarites</HI> catch them, they torment them &s;ufficiently, and deal with them as with Spies, without any compa&s;&s;i|on of them: &s;o that they &s;eldom return to this place again, but by their cruel enter|tainment they keep all their other Com|rades from entring in among&s;t the <HI>Seva|rambi.</HI> I know that in your Countries you have not that care nor vigilancy of your &s;elves for your own good. Hence it is, that all &s;orts of Devils have &s;o great an in|tere&s;t in your parts, and that you can &s;carce &s;tir without meeting one or many in your way. Be&s;ides, this Country between the Rivers bears an aromatick Tree, which the Devils cannot endure; for it &s;ends up into the Air &s;uch a &s;trong &s;mell, that they are ready to choke when they draw near to a place where it grows, and you &s;hall &s;ee that the Inhabitants have been advi&s;ed by their wi&s;e <HI>Sevarias,</HI> to plant one in every Garden and &s;ide of their Hou&s;es. The Tree is named <HI>Cra&s;&s;arabi,</HI> and bears a leaf like a Palm-leaf, but is full of prickles as a Thorn and Bramble-bu&s;h. The <HI>Sevarites</HI> have this way to torture the poor Devils that unhap|pily fall into their hands: they tye them with a Cord invi&s;ible to you, but vi&s;ible to
<PB N="50" REF="103">
them, an&s;werable to the &s;ub&s;tance of the Devils, which is airy, and then bind them to this Tree, where they &s;la&s;h them with a Rod cut out of the branches, which cau&s;es them to howl mo&s;t dreadfully. We may chance to give you a &s;ight of this action, if you travel into the Country towards the Borders. Another way they have to plague and impri&s;on them, by making Gun-pow|der; for when the Devils come into a Land, they always draw to that place where there is the greate&s;t noi&s;e and di&s;turbance, for there they imagine they may make a good intere&s;t. Now there is no greater noi&s;e in this Land than this of the Gun-powder, which we make not as you do in <HI>Europe,</HI> but with a wheel, as you may &s;ee, if you travel into the Land. Sometimes therefore it happens, that the &s;illie&s;t of them prying too near into the work, either to under&s;tand the Art, or to know what the <HI>Sevarites</HI> are doing, they are many times caught by their ears, and I have known half a dozen wound into a grain of Gun-powder, and impri&s;oned &s;o clo&s;e, that they could not po&s;&s;ibly get away, till the powder took fire. The be&s;t and &s;tronge&s;t powder hath always &s;ome of the&s;e airy Beings &s;hut up. This cau&s;eth the de&s;truction that fol|lows
<PB N="51" REF="103">
when Gun-powder takes fire; for then the Devils being relea&s;ed, break out with a vengeance, and tear in pieces all that dare &s;tand in their way. The <HI>Seva|rites</HI> have many other ways to puni&s;h them for the in&s;olences and wickedne&s;&s;es which they have committed in the World; but when I have an opportunity, I &s;hall give you an account of that. I could wi&s;h, &s;aid <HI>Maurice,</HI> that our Country-men in <HI>Europe</HI> knew how to deal with the&s;e &s;ubtle Crea|tures, and how to be revenged for the con|tinual wrongs which they daily receive from their malice and evil &s;ugge&s;tions. It is a que&s;tion, &s;aid I, whether many of them would make u&s;e of that Art, if they knew it; for a great many are &s;o plea&s;ed with their company and &s;ugge&s;tions, that they &s;eek them rather, than to endeavour to be rid of them. Well, &s;aid <HI>Sermodas,</HI> let them be in love with their own mi&s;chief and danger, the <HI>Sevarites</HI> are &s;eldom taken and deceived by their allurements: and if at any time they are carried to any wicked|ne&s;s, they are bani&s;hed; and if the Devil be caught, he is &s;everely tortured. This good order and many others, when I &s;hall &s;peak to you of their Laws, pre&s;erves hap|pine&s;s, peace, and pro&s;perity in this Coun|try.</P>
<P><PB N="52" REF="104">
This Di&s;cour&s;e plea&s;ed us well, and cau|&s;ed us to intreat <HI>Sermodas</HI> to take &s;ome other time to inform us of the Laws of the <HI>Sevarites.</HI> We asked him &s;everal other que&s;tions concerning their Government within the Rivers, concerning their Cu|&s;toms and Tributes, and whether all the Country was &s;o happy and rich as that which we had already beheld. He an&s;we|red to all que&s;tions &s;o exactly, that we thought our &s;elves much obliged to him for his &s;ingular favour. He was well acquaint|ed with all things, for he had been imploy|ed about the Affairs of <HI>Sevarminas</HI> from his infancy, and was often &s;ent to carry the Tribute to his Court. He told us, that the Kings Revenues were certain, and that from all parts men brought to him all &s;orts of Nece&s;&s;aries for him and his numerous Court. That he never had any need to de|mand more, for his Expences were as re|gular as his Incomes; and that if he &s;hould want any thing more, there is none of his Subjects, from the meane&s;t to the highe&s;t, but would think him&s;elf highly honoured, if he would accept of all that they have. But as he is a great Lover of Ju&s;tice and Equi|ty, he is content with the ancient Rever&s;i|ons of the Provinces, which are &s;ufficient
<PB N="53" REF="104">
to cau&s;e him and his Court to live in great abundance and extraordinary Splendour, which all the <HI>Sevarites</HI> looked upon as their greate&s;t Glory. <HI>Sevarminas,</HI> &s;aid he, is a middle-aged man, and hath reigned in this place twenty two years, with the general love of all his Subjects. He is adored by us all as our vi&s;ible God. His Fathers name was <HI>Seravino,</HI> a Prince of an extraor|dinary Beauty; he reigned among&s;t us thir|ty years, and mightily inlarged the Palace and Dwelling of the Kings of this Country. You &s;hall &s;ee to morrow a place which hath not its parallel on Earth for Riches and humane Glory, and you &s;hall &s;ee a Prince and &s;uch noble Attendants, that your eyes never looked upon any thing, nor per&s;ons more de&s;erving admiration. After this di&s;cour&s;e, <HI>Sermodas</HI> led us all to our Cham|bers, where we had all things convenient for us, and &s;hewing us in a great wide room hung with Cloth of Gold, each mans Bed of embroidered Silver for him to re&s;t till the next morning, he took his leave of us, and bid us good night. We re&s;ted very &s;weetly without any di&s;turbance till the next morning, when a Concert of Mu&s;ick in the next Chamber awakened us. <HI>Sermo|das</HI> opened fir&s;t our door, and entred our
<PB N="54" REF="105">
Room, de&s;iring us to get up and put on the Apparel which he had brought to us. Whiles we were dre&s;&s;ing of our &s;elves, a Me&s;&s;enger came from King <HI>Sevarminas</HI> to ha&s;ten us away, becau&s;e he intended to give us Audience, and then to take &s;ome Recrea|tion before Dinner. At the time of our appearance he appointed ten Senators of his City, men of great Gravity and Worth, to attend upon us, and lead us to him. We were conducted through the Streets full of <HI>Sevarites,</HI> who &s;eldom &s;ee Strangers in tho&s;e parts. Their curio&s;ity cau&s;ed them to throng together to look upon us: we marched thus about half a mile through the mo&s;t &s;plendid places, and had the &s;ight of &s;o many rare objects, that the World cannot afford the like. The number of Jewels and precious Stones, the quantity of Gold, Silver, the excellency of the Stru|ctures, Arches, Palaces, and Temples dedi|cated to their God, are beyond all credit and imagination of men. But nothing &s;urpri&s;ed us &s;o much as to look upon the Royal Court and the glory of it. It &s;tands upon a &s;mall ri&s;ing incompa&s;&s;ed about with a deep River, and walled three times round with &s;quare &s;tones cut out of a Diamant Rock about &s;ix foot &s;quare, and poli&s;hed &s;o
<PB N="55" REF="105">
well, that at the fir&s;t approach our eyes could not endure the brightne&s;s of the place when the Sun &s;hines clear without a cloud. Some other precious Stones were intermix|ed of green and red colours, but all tran&s;|parent. There was but one entrance over the River by a Bridge. The fir&s;t Gate was full of Ivory Pillars and Supporters, and embelli&s;hed with large &s;tones, black and white Marble. Round about in the void &s;pace were delicate Walks, and Gardens full of &s;trange &s;orts of Trees, &s;ome yellow, others green, &s;ome black, others white, and &s;hewing to the eye &s;uch a variety of beau|tiful colours, that it is the mo&s;t glorious Pro&s;pect of the World. The &s;econd Wall was all of a red &s;tone, but bright and &s;hi|ning. The third and innermo&s;t Wall was as white as Snow, like to our Alaba&s;ter, but of a &s;tone which is not to be found in any part of the Northern World. In the empty places round about between the Walls, grew all manner of Trees for plea|&s;ure or profit, with &s;ome that are not to be &s;een el&s;ewhere. The Kings Palace &s;tood within the&s;e three Inclo&s;ures, having round about it a large Green with &s;everal Walks of &s;andy Gold and &s;tately Images of Alaba&s;ter and Porphyry, repre&s;enting
<PB N="56" REF="106">
all manner of &s;hapes, as bea&s;ts, birds, and men in mo&s;t actions of their life. The&s;e Images &s;tood upon Ba&s;es of Saphir, and the Images were all made of a tran&s;parent hard &s;tone as clear as Cry&s;tal. You may imagine, that at our fir&s;t entrance, the Sun &s;hining in its greate&s;t brightne&s;s upon them, we were ca&s;t into a &s;udden maze, and &s;urpri&s;ed at the unexpected view of &s;o ma|ny glorious things. The Palace was per|fectly round, with four long Galleries reaching from &s;ide to &s;ide, and as many Gates. It was built of precious Stones, of all &s;orts and &s;izes: the Tyling was of Gold and Silver, and the in&s;ide was &s;o curiou&s;ly wrought, and &s;o rich, that it is not to be imagined nor believed, if I &s;hould here de|clare every particular. The King &s;ate in an empty Court in the middle of his Palace, under a beautiful Gallery inriched with all manner of Jewels: round about him on the right and left &s;tood his Coun&s;ellors and Attendants: his Seat was a Throne of &s;ix &s;teps, over which there was a Canopy of State, before it were &s;ix Ba&s;es upon which &s;tood &s;ix Lions rampant of a red &s;tone. To this place we were conducted by <HI>Sermodas</HI> and the Ten Grandees, and led to the foot of the Throne, where we were taught to do
<PB N="57" REF="106">
our Obei&s;ance upon our knees. The King had a rich Crown upon his Head, and a Scepter in his right Hand, and &s;ate in a great deal of Maje&s;ty and Glory. <HI>Sermodas</HI> advi&s;ed me to &s;peak to the King, as &s;oon as we had paid him that re&s;pect which was due to his Per&s;on and place. <Q>Therefore I &s;tood up, and addre&s;&s;ed my &s;elf to him in this manner in the French Tongue, which he under&s;tood well: Mo&s;t glorious and mighty Prince, you &s;ee before you poor Strangers ca&s;t upon your Coa&s;ts by a &s;torm, which I know not how to name, happy or unhappy; for &s;ince our Arrival in your Land, we have met with &s;o many civilities and expre&s;&s;ions of kindne&s;s from your lo|ving People, that we have already recei|ved a compen&s;ation for the lo&s;s of our Ships and Goods. We are come here to adore your Maje&s;ty in obedience to your Commands, and to receive from you tho&s;e Orders, which we &s;hall punctually follow. We doubt not but according to your won|derful clemency, your Maje&s;ty will look with compa&s;&s;ion upon &s;uch objects of pity as Providence hath made us, and to rai&s;e us up from our hard and low Fortune. As all things that we have hitherto met with in your noble Kingdom, are beyond all
<PB N="58" REF="107">
belief and credit, we are per&s;waded that the King of &s;o glorious a Land, mu&s;t needs have Vertues as extraordinary and Di|vine. We humbly &s;ubmit our &s;elves therefore to your Maje&s;ties Wi&s;dom and Mercy, and that when we &s;hall have per|formed what your Maje&s;ty &s;hall think fit to require from us, you would out of your compa&s;&s;ion and goodne&s;s, &s;uffer us to de|part into our own Countries, that we may &s;pread abroad all over the World the Riches, the Excellency, and Wealth of this earthly Paradi&s;e, and the noble Ver|tues of your mo&s;t Glorious Maje&s;ty, and publi&s;h your Fame where-ever the Sun ap|pears with his beams of Light.</Q> <HI>Sevarmi|nas</HI> &s;eemed to like our per&s;ons and our Speech, to which he returned this An&s;wer: That he had &s;ent for us, not to offer any injury to our per&s;ons: That he who was a Lover of Ju&s;tice among&s;t his own Subjects, could not do inju&s;tice to Strangers: That the <HI>Sevarites</HI> in general were of a civil be|haviour, and inclinable to pity the mi&s;eries of other men; but that he had given &s;trict Orders to have a care of our per&s;ons, and furni&s;hes with all that we &s;hould want. He told us, That not only the curio&s;ity of &s;ee|ing us, who were come out of remote Na|tions,
<PB N="59" REF="107">
famous for their indu&s;try and wit, had cau&s;ed him to &s;end for us to di&s;cour&s;e with us, and under&s;tand our Cu&s;toms and Manners; but al&s;o to di&s;cover to us his Kingdom and the Riches of it, that we might report it in our own Lands, and in|courage &s;ome to venture to trade with his People: That for that purpo&s;e he would appoint a place or an I&s;land in the Pacifick Sea, where all the Commodities and Riches of the <HI>Sevarambi</HI> &s;hould be tran&s;ported, be|cau&s;e the ancient Laws, as well as the good and pre&s;ervation of his Kingdoms Peace, Vertues, and Innocency, &s;uffered him not to admit all manner of Strangers into his Borders: That he had received a good re|port of us, which inclined him the more to &s;end for us, and that he hoped that our conver&s;ation and behaviour would be an|&s;werable to his expectation, and the kind|ne&s;s that he would &s;hew. After this, he inquired of our Country, how long we had been from it, who commanded in Chief, what Commodities we had of any reque&s;t, what Arts and Sciences of any u&s;e to the life of man. To all the&s;e particulars, and many others, I gave him full &s;atisfaction. So that, as a gratification, he &s;ent for a Box of Jewels, which he be&s;towed upon
<PB N="60" REF="108">
us, together with Collars of Gold and Am|bergrie&s;e, which he wi&s;hed us to wear whiles we &s;hould remain in that Country. After we had continued with him about an hour, he ro&s;e up from his Throne, and commanded <HI>Zidi Parabas,</HI> the Ma&s;ter of his Ceremonies, to lead us to Lodgings provided for us in his own Palace, and <HI>Zidi Marlorat</HI> his Chancellor and chief Mi|ni&s;ter, to di&s;cour&s;e with us about a Trade, and the means to open it with us. During our abode in tho&s;e parts, we had &s;eve|ral meetings with him, and a&s;&s;ured him, that the <HI>Dutch</HI> Nation would be overjoy'd to meet with &s;o civil a People, &s;o &s;ociable and amiable, and that they would quickly embrace the fir&s;t motion of a Trade with them. We extolled our home-Commodi|ties, and &s;hewed what advantage they would reap by a conver&s;ation with us; but the Chancellor told me, That &s;uch as I was &s;hould have liberty to enter into their Bor|ders; but Ru&s;&s;ians and Ra&s;cals of an ill life could not be admitted by the Laws of their Land. Yet they &s;hould have leave to trade in <HI>Sporumbe,</HI> and in the I&s;lands, which <HI>Sevarminds</HI> would appoint for that pur|po&s;e; but that none of the <HI>Sevarites</HI> &s;hould go thither, unle&s;s it be &s;uch bani&s;hed men
<PB N="61" REF="108">
as are &s;ent away for their mi&s;demeanours. I replied to him, That if he would keep away from thence &s;uch as are bani&s;hed out of <HI>Sevaramb&egrave;</HI> for their Knavery, we would trade with all the re&s;t; for we and all our Country-men had rather deal with hone&s;t men than with Knaves. At la&s;t it was con|cluded to prevent the inconveniencies on both &s;ides, That all the <HI>Dutch</HI> &s;hould land among&s;t the <HI>Sporvi,</HI> and in an I&s;land that is at the mouth of the great River <HI>Rocara</HI> in the Pacifick Sea, about an hundred and thir|ty Lagues from the Streights of <HI>Magellan.</HI> This I&s;land is peopled with a generation of men de&s;cended from the <HI>Sevarites,</HI> and ba|ni&s;hed out of the Country for their inordi|nate love of women and men. There are three good Towns belonging to it, and a capacious Harbor for Ships of the greate&s;t burden. I acquainted the Chancellor with our Art of Navigation, with many other knowledges which the <HI>Europeans</HI> u&s;e with great profit and advantage to their King|doms. He &s;eemed to be well &s;atisfied and mightily plea&s;ed with the account I had given him. Whiles <HI>Sevarminas</HI> was gone to hunt and &s;port him&s;elf, <HI>Sermodas</HI> and <HI>Zidi Parabas</HI> led us round about the Gal|leries and Walks, &s;hewing us the rare Fi&s;h|ponds,
<PB N="62" REF="109">
the &s;tately Orchards, the riches and beauty of the Buildings, and all things round about, which cau&s;ed us to wonder, and &s;tand many times in a maze. The Art of Painting is here al&s;o, and the <HI>Sevarites</HI> excel in that skill. Therefore the Galleries, and generally all the Palace of <HI>Sevarminas,</HI> was adorned with many lively Repre&s;enta|tions. <HI>Maurice,</HI> who was an excellent Painter, admired &s;ome Pictures, and told us, that he thought they could not be made but by a Divine hand. The <HI>Sevarites</HI> are excellent in Geometry and A&s;trology. They have differing names for all the Stars that appear in their Hemi&s;phere, and under|&s;tand perfectly well all their Motions and Vertues. As &s;oon as we returned from our plea&s;ant Walk, we met with <HI>Sevarmi|nas</HI> about dinner-time returned from his Hunting, whereof I &s;hall give this &s;hort ac|count, for this Sport is not like to ours. The <HI>Sevarites</HI> hunt not with Dogs, but with tame Foxes, of an extraordinary &s;wiftne&s;s; they hunt Rabbets, Hares, Deer; and all other wild bea&s;ts are hunted with tame Leopards. In the morning that the King intends to &s;ee this Sport, the chief Hunt&s;|man hath orders to prepare all things for the diver&s;ion, twenty Leopards are then let
<PB N="63" REF="109">
loo&s;e in a wide Park, where the wild bea&s;t is brought. The King and all his Nobles are mounted upon their glorious Mules, of beautiful colours, with Trappings of Silver and Gold, adorned with precious Stones. The Leopards, at the &s;ight of the Lion or the Bear, draw near to him by degrees, and taking their opportunity, they run to him. When he feels him&s;elf overpower|ed, he &s;eeks his &s;afety in his heels, and all the Mules gallop after him. I am not able to repre&s;ent all the various actions and de|lights that are here expre&s;&s;ed to the Be|holders eyes; but this kind of Hunting is much e&s;teemed by the <HI>Sevarites,</HI> and none have the liberty to make u&s;e of it, but the King and &s;ome of the prime Nobles; for it is a Royal Sport, and gives much &s;ati&s;|faction to the Spectators. <HI>Sevarminas</HI> at his return entred into his Palace, accompa|nied with all his Servants, in very rich At|tire: &s;ome of them came and &s;poke to us in the Spani&s;h Tongue, and bid us welcome into their Country. We an&s;wered their Civilities with re&s;pect, and followed the Train of <HI>Sevarminas</HI> that walked two and two into the Palace, into a great Hall an hundred yards in length, and as many in breadth, where Tables were ready covered
<PB N="64" REF="110">
with all manner of curious Dainties, of all &s;orts. <HI>Sevarminas</HI> and his Queen, with three of his Sons, and &s;ix of his Daughters, &s;ate down at a Table, which &s;tood at the upper end, rai&s;ed a little above the re&s;t, un|der a large Canopy &s;hining with Gold and precious Stones, of an ine&s;timable value. As &s;oon as they were &s;ate down, the Mu&s;ick in the Galleries round about began to play &s;uch ravi&s;hing Tunes, that we <HI>Europeans</HI> were a&s;toni&s;hed. <HI>Sermodas</HI> and <HI>Zidi Para|bas</HI> invited us to &s;it down at a Table not far from that of <HI>Sevarminas.</HI> To tell you of all the Glory and State we beheld, the &s;weetne&s;s of the Wines, the various Servi|ces, and the dainty Meats, of the excellent and ravi&s;hing Sights, I reckon it impo&s;&s;ible, I could fill up a Volume of tho&s;e things that were then pre&s;ented to our &s;en&s;es; &s;o many and &s;uch variety of objects, rare and wonderful, appeared before us, that when <HI>Zidi Parabas</HI> &s;aw how we were plea|&s;ed with them, he inquired of us, whether we had any &s;uch Delights in <HI>Europe.</HI> I an|&s;wered, That the plea&s;ures and delights of the <HI>Europeans</HI> are many and curious, but they are not to be compared to what we then &s;aw. One of the Table inquired of us about &s;ome other particulars; and becau&s;e
<PB N="65" REF="110">
he was a Learned Philo&s;opher, he propo&s;ed to us &s;everal learned Que&s;tions relating to the Nature of things. Every one had li|berty to &s;peak his mind and judgment. After all, he declared his opinion, with a repetition of what every one had &s;poken, and then added his own &s;olution with that Learning and Gravity, that I never heard the like. This to me and <HI>Maurice</HI> was al|mo&s;t as good as the Mu&s;ick and Meats; for at Table it is a modern as well as ancient delight to feed the mind with rare in&s;tru|ctions, as well as the body with meat and drink. After Dinner <HI>Zidi Parabas</HI> went to wait upon <HI>Sevarminas,</HI> and under&s;tand his plea&s;ure. When he was returned to us again, he brought us up to <HI>Sevarminas,</HI> who was then &s;itting on his Throne with his Queen <HI>Larida</HI> at his right hand, and his Daughters and his Sons on the left. She was the mo&s;t beautiful Creature that I ever beheld. We paid them our re&s;pects according to the mode of their Country. To plea&s;e Queen <HI>Larida, Sevarminas</HI> asked us many que&s;tions in Spani&s;h, a Tongue which &s;he under&s;tood: after all they &s;eemed to be well &s;atisfied. <HI>Sevarminas</HI> &s;ent us all Gifts and Pre&s;ents of a great value. When I was returned into <HI>Europe,</HI> I &s;old the Jewels
<PB N="66" REF="111">
and other Rarities, which the King and Queen be&s;towed upon me, for above &s;ix millions of Gold. <HI>Maurice</HI> and the re&s;t of my Companions had Gifts according to their Qualities. We had Orders to walk about the City, and take a view of the Ra|rities of that wonderful place. To &s;peak truth, every thing, if it were in our own Country, would &s;eem a rarity. I never beheld &s;o much Glory and Riches, nor &s;uch beautiful objects, nor &s;uch gravity, and comely Per&s;onages &s;o full of Maje&s;ty and goodne&s;s. They were &s;o far from &s;corn|ing or contemning us that were Strangers, that they &s;eemed they could not too much honour and re&s;pect us; for <HI>Sevarminas</HI> had given that &s;trict Order, to give us all the &s;atisfaction that we could de&s;ire.</P>
<P><HI>Zidi Parabas</HI> led us to their publick Halls through beautiful Streets, paved with many tran&s;parent &s;tones. When we en|tred into them, we &s;aw their Court of Ju|dicature. On both &s;ides were the Lawyers Cells or little Clo&s;ets. The&s;e are a certain number of men, who are locked up as Pri|&s;oners in this place, and not &s;uffered to range up and down the City, for fear they &s;hould infect the re&s;t of men with their idle notions and Quirks. They are here all
<PB N="67" REF="111">
kept, the Judges only excepted, as our mad and cra&s;ie men in <HI>Europe,</HI> are confined to <HI>Bedlams,</HI> and as the wild bea&s;ts to their dens; for by this Policy they pre&s;erve the City in quiet. When we were in their va&s;t Hall, and heard &s;ome entring in, they looked all to &s;ee, whether we were fit for their turn, whe|ther we had committed &s;ome offence that de&s;erved puni&s;hment; but when they &s;aw that we viewed that place only out of cu|rio&s;ity, they &s;neaked all in again, and would not &s;o much as look upon us all the time that we were there, till the Trumpet began to &s;ound, and the Judge &s;ate upon his Seat. Then came in a company of <HI>Sevarites</HI> lead|ing a young Girl that had forgotten her &s;elf, and given liberty to a puny Fellow to play the wag with her. They had both of them great punches of fle&s;h growing upon their No&s;es and Foreheads, which came up in the very act. As &s;oon as their Neighbours had beheld this &s;uperfluity, they under&s;tood the crime, and took hold of them both to bring them to this Tribunal. The Lawyers, like Bees, &s;warmed round about, all the petty Attorneys, Clerks, Bailiffs, Sergeants, de|my-Sergeants, Pleaders, Sollicitors, Proba|tioners, &amp;c. and &s;uch a gang of them, that I pitied the poor Couple to fall into their
<PB N="68" REF="112">
unmerciful hands. Among&s;t the <HI>Sevarites</HI> in every City they have a Hall or a Con|vent of the&s;e per&s;ons, whom they all e&s;teem no better than Butchers and Executioners, they have not that honour as among&s;t us in <HI>Europe,</HI> nor that e&s;teem of hone&s;t men, with which many of them cozen our World. <HI>Zidi Parabas</HI> made me get up to hear their Pleading, but I under&s;tood not their Lan|guage, only <HI>Sermodas</HI> gave me an account of &s;ome pa&s;&s;ages. The crime was not to be denied, which cau&s;ed them both to look a&s;hamed, becau&s;e they had forgotten all hone&s;ty, and lo&s;t their honour. The Judge asked them many que&s;tions. All the cruel Lawyers cryed to puni&s;h her with death, becau&s;e &s;he had not given them any thing to plead for her; but the young man had got a bawling Lawyer to &s;peak for him when his crime came to be examined; but all would not do: he would have made the Judge believe, that this Excre&s;cence in his &s;ace was only a natural deformity proceed|ing from &s;ome other inward cau&s;e, and not from Lu&s;t. But the Judge, a wi&s;e and brave man, of the Court of <HI>Sevarminas,</HI> convinced him of his errour, and made him at la&s;t confe&s;s, that the Girl had inticed him with her bewitching Looks. In con|clu&s;ion
<PB N="69" REF="112">
of the Tryal, the lecherous couple were &s;ent to the I&s;land of Whores and Rogues, where they were to live confined for ever from all friends and acquaintances, and to &s;pend their life in lu&s;t and debau|chery, a &s;ufficient puni&s;hment, as they ima|gined, for their forgetfulne&s;s. I took no great delight among&s;t the Lawyers; for I looked upon this place as the Hell in the mid&s;t of the earthly Paradi&s;e of the <HI>Seva|rites.</HI> After the&s;e two Fornicators had been judged and condemned to perpetual bani&s;h|ment, where neverthele&s;s they live in great plenty, there was brought before the Judge a Thief, a &s;neaking Fellow, differing in looks, as well as in manners, from the re&s;t of the <HI>Sevarambi.</HI> The Judge, who&s;e name was <HI>Zidi Mora&s;co,</HI> commanded him to be examined before him by a crafty Lawyer. And it was proved plain again&s;t him, that he had &s;tole &s;ome Jewels and Gold from his Neighbour, with &s;ome Gar|ments of Cloth of Silver, covered over with precious Stones, of a great value. The Fel|lows countenance &s;ince this deed was migh|tily changed; for every wicked action, e&s;pecially among&s;t the <HI>Sevarites,</HI> alters the countenances of men. The Eyes being the windows of the Soul, through them it di&s;|covers
<PB N="70" REF="113">
all the inward thoughts, fears, ap|prehen&s;ions, and di&s;plea&s;ures that rowl in the brea&s;t. Be&s;ides, the Thieves have here in this Country a mark, which immediately appears upon their Chins and Cheeks, a black &s;pot very ugly to the eye. This Fel|low al&s;o was adjudged unworthy to live any longer among&s;t the religious <HI>Sevarites.</HI> I asked <HI>Sermodas,</HI> why the <HI>Sevarambi</HI> &s;uffe|red the Lawyers, who I told him in our Country, were generally none of the be&s;t men in the World: What! &s;aid he, have you any there? Yes, &s;aid I, to our &s;orrow, we cannot be quiet for them. Captain, replied he, I mu&s;t tell you, were it not for the&s;e Fellows, the <HI>Sevarites</HI> would not be able to live &s;o quiet as they do; nor &s;o in|nocent as in all other Countries: fear as well as &s;hame mu&s;t keep men in awe, and in the performance of their duties to their Negh|bours and Superiours. And though men are not here &s;o inclinable to wickedne&s;s as in <HI>Europe,</HI> becau&s;e they proceed from ano|ther &s;tock and generation of men; yet the plea&s;ures of the Country, together with the inticements of &s;ome &s;ubtle Devils, whom we cannot always perceive, many may be brought to do what is contrary to Law, Rea&s;on, Equity, and Ju&s;tice. It is there|fore
<PB N="71" REF="113">
for the publick Good, that the&s;e men are living among&s;t us. And though they are as bad as tho&s;e whom they plead a|gain&s;t, they are here confined in the&s;e and &s;uch like. Cells, where there is a publick provi&s;ion made for them, to keep them from running up and down to breed di&s;tur|bances. Such among&s;t them as are hone&s;t, good, and merciful men, are highly e&s;tee|med, but they are very rare; and if they were known to be hone&s;t and good men among&s;t the Lawyers, the re&s;t would not &s;uffer them to come near the Bar, but would bani&s;h them out of their Society, and de|prive them of all manner of Practice and liberty of Pleading. The greater Knaves they are, the more e&s;teemed among&s;t the Lawyers, though le&s;s valued by the re&s;t of the <HI>Sevarites.</HI> Therefore, to keep up their credit among&s;t both, is a hard Chapter, and not to be done without &s;ome kind of di&s;&s;i|mulation on &s;ome &s;ide. With that he pointed at a great fat Fellow, who &s;tood up in Court to &s;ee and look for his Clients: Do you &s;ee, &s;aid he, that Knave? Do you &s;ee him? I turned my eyes towards him, and beheld him &s;tedfa&s;tly, and asked what he was: He is, &s;aid <HI>Sermodas,</HI> one of the chief Attornies of this Court, a cunning Fellow,

his name is <HI>Rekrap,</HI> a wicked Villain, and a great Oppre&s;&s;or of poor Fellows that fall into his hands. After the Court had exa|mined and tryed all the Cau&s;es, the Law|yers departed to their Dens; and <HI>Zidi Pa|rabas</HI> taking me by the hand, led me to the Shambles of the City, and to view all the Excellencies of that Noble place. As I was pa&s;&s;ing one of their Temples, I intreat|ed him to give me a &s;ight of that which I judged to be a Rarity, or rather full of Ra|rities; for it was &s;o glorious without, that I could not but think that the in&s;ide was far more rich and &s;plendid. <HI>Zidi Parabas</HI> made &s;ome difficulty to yield to my re|que&s;t; but <HI>Sermodas</HI> per&s;waded him to grant it at la&s;t, when he had asked me &s;ome que&s;tions concerning the Religion of our Country: Are you not, &s;aid he, de&s;iled with Idolatry, I mean with the Wor&s;hipping of Images; for I mu&s;t tell you, that this is a great abomination among&s;t the <HI>Sevarambi.</HI> We have Pictures and Images in our Hou|&s;es, but none in our Temples: we adore a great and glorious Being, the Creator and Author of this earthly Paradi&s;e: he is an infinite Spirit, not to be con&s;ined within our walls; therefore our Temples are open on the top, when we are at our Devotions.

He is not to be likened to any outward Image or Repre&s;entation; therefore our ever ble&s;&s;ed <HI>Sevarias</HI> commanded us to have no Images in our Temples, nor to liken God to any Creature or Repre&s;entation vi&s;ible to the eye. If therefore you have never di&s;honoured your &s;elf with &s;uch kind of practices, you may be admitted to &s;ee and walk in our Temples. I thanked him for his kind conde&s;cen&s;ion, and a&s;&s;ured him, that though it was a wickedne&s;s that many Nations in <HI>Europe</HI> were guilty of, yet our Country-men abominate &s;uch kind of fol|lies, and that for my own particular I never was of that Religion which allows of Ido|latry and Wor&s;hipping of Images. When he under&s;tood this, he walked to the great Gate of the chief Temple, where he met with a grave Prie&s;t &s;tanding at the door, unto whom he declared our bu&s;ine&s;s: the Prie&s;t took me by the hand, and in Spani&s;h told me, that I &s;hould &s;ee the Temple of his God. I walked round, and &s;aw &s;o ma|ny glorious Sights and &s;uch extraordinary Riches, that all <HI>Europe</HI> together cannot produce the like. The Prie&s;ts name was <HI>Ziribabdas.</HI> I de&s;ired him to tell me &s;ome|thing of the Religion of the Country, and of their Manners: for that purpo&s;e <HI>Zidi</HI>
<PB N="74" REF="115">
<HI>Parabas</HI> took me by the hand, and led me to a by-place much like a Chancel, where when we were all &s;ate down, in Niches of beaten Gold in the Wall, <HI>Ziribabdas</HI> began his Di&s;cour&s;e in this manner: I perceive you are a &s;tranger to this Country and to the Cu&s;toms of the <HI>Sevarites,</HI> I know not what Religion you have in your Country, nor what thoughts you have of the Great God, who hath made us all; but I hope none of you are guilty of the foul &s;in of Wor&s;hip|ping of Images, which we hear is univer&s;al|ly practi&s;ed by the <HI>Europeans.</HI> I an&s;wered him, That there were a great many Nations who did abominate and hate &s;uch practices as well as the <HI>Sevarites.</HI> Well, &s;aid he, in regard you are free from that vice and ba&s;e|ne&s;s, I will &s;hew you a great many Sacred Curio&s;ities of this Temple, which you have not yet &s;een, and I will give you a brief account of our Religion in this Country. You mu&s;t therefore know, that we acknow|ledge but one only Great God, Maker of all things, Lord of Heaven and Earth, who &s;endeth us all tho&s;e good things that we injoy: Rea&s;on teacheth to wor&s;hip and prai&s;e him for his goodne&s;s and innumera|ble mercies. For that purpo&s;e we have Schools erected in every corner of this City
<PB N="75" REF="115">
to train up Youth, and teach them the Principles of Religion. All per&s;ons are obliged twice every week to a&s;&s;i&s;t at our publick Devotions, which are Songs made to prai&s;e our God, with In&s;truments of Mu|&s;ick: we have al&s;o Prayers, which I and my Brethren offer for the pro&s;perity of <HI>Se|varminas</HI> and of his Royal Family. Once a year every per&s;on is obliged to pre&s;ent &s;omething upon a Table, which &s;tands in the middle of this and other Temples, as a token of gratitude to God: now this thing is always the riche&s;t and be&s;t beloved thing that he hath. By this means every one &s;hews, that his affection for God is greater than for any thing el&s;e. Religion among&s;t us is the mo&s;t &s;acred thing, and what&s;oever belongs to Religion is highly valued by every one. There is the greate&s;t re&s;pect &s;hewn to religious per&s;ons and religious things among&s;t all the <HI>Sevarites,</HI> you &s;hall not hear Oaths and Bla&s;phemies, Cur&s;ing and Damning. The Rules of good living are regi&s;tred in the Book of our Law giver <HI>Sevarias;</HI> and &s;ince that time we are all &s;o addicted to it, and all our Generations &s;o u&s;ed and trained up in our obedience to the&s;e Laws, that very few per&s;ons offer to break or violate them: and if at any time
<PB N="76" REF="116">
any &s;uch be, he is carried away and bani&s;h|ed into the I&s;lands: by this means peace, plenty, and good manners are here to be &s;een every where, and men take not the liberty to do what they li&s;t. But the Rules of Rea&s;on are commonly ob&s;erved by all the <HI>Sevarites</HI> in their behaviour and acti|ons: &s;o that you &s;hall not &s;ee any thing of Drunkenne&s;s, Gluttony, Quarrelling, Mur|ders, and Villanies committed &s;carce in a whole year all over the Empire. But for our better Government in matters of Re|ligion, be&s;ides our King, who is the chief Moderator in all di&s;putable matters, we have thirty Chieftains under &s;ix principal Heads, who are always at the Court attend|ing upon our Prince. The&s;e thirty live in their Precincts and Juri&s;dictions, having under them &s;uch as have the care of and in&s;pection over every Town and Hamlet. We have be&s;ides, publick Meetings and A&s;|&s;emblies to con&s;ult about matters of high moment. Now there is &s;uch an excellent order and harmony in all re&s;pects, that we injoy Peace both in Divine and Civil Af|fairs, and there is no jarring, di&s;putations, and di&s;&s;en&s;ions, as among&s;t you in <HI>Europe,</HI> but a ble&s;&s;ed concord and agreement. If any be &s;u&s;pected to be otherwi&s;e di&s;po&s;ed,

he is immediately bani&s;hed to the lone&s;om I&s;lands, where he can quarrel with none but with wild bea&s;ts that inhabit there. He is never &s;uffered after to &s;et a foot in the Country of the <HI>Sevarambi;</HI> but there in tho&s;e I&s;lands among&s;t the Woods and Caves he is confined, and obliged to &s;pend the re&s;t of his days in fighting with the Lions, Jac|cals, wild Dogs, Bears, and &s;uch like furi|ous Creatures. By this means you &s;hall &s;ee we pre&s;erve peace and quiet both in Church and State. But that our Governors might not act in an arbitrary way, we &s;uffer no mans Will to be a Law, but that of our glo|rious <HI>Sevarminas</HI> and his lawful Succe&s;&s;ors; but for the re&s;t of all our Governors, they have Rules and Laws to act by in all occa|&s;ions: neither can they do any thing with|out the con&s;ent, advice, and concurrence of other wi&s;e men appointed for that pur|po&s;e. For our Belief, I mu&s;t tell you, we know and are taught by Nature as well as by the Works of our great <HI>Sevarias,</HI> that God created all things in Heaven and Earth: That in the beginning this Paradi&s;e &s;tood in another part of the World; but when men began to abu&s;e tho&s;e good things that it affords, it was tran&s;ported hither upon the &s;houlders of Angels, and

all the Trees planted here, where they have increa&s;ed: and that becau&s;e the fir&s;t Gene|ration of men was corrupt and wicked, there was another man and woman made to inhabit here, and to live in this ble&s;&s;ed Kingdom. We believe, that when we come to dye, our Souls being of a &s;piritual &s;ub&s;tance, fly up to the Firmament, where they re&s;t till a certain time be appointed to joyn them again together. Now our bo|dies decay not as yours, we lay them in pla|ces where they continue thou&s;ands of years without any alteration. I &s;hall &s;hew you our Sepulchres, and that of our Kings, where you may &s;ee all the Princes who have governed in the&s;e happy Regions &s;ince the beginning of the World, as fre&s;h as if they were yet all alive.</P>
<P>We believe, that when our bodies and Souls &s;hall be again joyned, your generation and ours &s;hall be received together into a place appointed for us, &s;uch I mean of you as are hone&s;t and good men; but for the re&s;t of you, I know not what you are fit for, unle&s;s it be to be ca&s;t into the Sea, or ba|ni&s;hed to a lone&s;om place, where they may live without doing harm. We believe that there are good and evil Spirits above us, and that the Sun, Moon, and Stars are
<PB N="79" REF="117">
full of Creatures an&s;werable to their light and beauty. We believe, that when this generation &s;hall be tran&s;ported &s;omewhere el&s;e, other Creatures &s;hall &s;ucceed us in this Paradi&s;e, and in other parts of the World. We have many things that we believe; but I mu&s;t tell you, that our rea|&s;on directs us, and rules our judgments in all matters of Faith as well as practice; only &s;ome things of a &s;ublime nature, which our &s;en&s;es cannot attain to, we mu&s;t &s;ubmit to the Wi&s;dom of our <HI>Sevarias,</HI> who had them by In&s;piration from the Angels, with whom he had a familiar acquaintance, and therefore his body is not to be found in the Sepulchre of our Kings; but it is thought they took him with them into the place appointed for their abode, and that there he lives with them without fear of death, in expectation that all his Po&s;terity &s;hould come to him. But you mu&s;t take notice, That &s;uch of our Generation as are bani&s;hed for their mi&s;demeanors, will be admitted one day to the &s;ame happine&s;s, if they bear patiently their puni&s;hment, and are &s;orry for their wickedne&s;s; but &s;uch al&s;o mu&s;t be purged in a fire which is in the Air, through which their bodies, as well as ours, mu&s;t pa&s;s to mount up to the highe&s;t
<PB N="80" REF="118">
&s;tation de&s;igned for us: but with this diffe|rence, that the fire &s;hall open to let us go by; but they mu&s;t burn a while there, till their bodies be freed from all corruption and filth, &s;ome more, &s;ome le&s;s, according to their di&s;po&s;itions, but few &s;tay there le&s;s than twenty years, &s;ome an hundred, others a thou&s;and, till &s;uch time as their bodies be &s;ublimated and fit for an higher abode. Such of us as are incorrigible, &s;hall be con|fined to a &s;ad Pit, where they &s;hall be up to the Elbows in Mire and Dirt, and be de|prived of all comforts of life. Whiles he was &s;peaking this, there happened an acci|dent, which cau&s;ed him to &s;top and put an end to this good Di&s;cour&s;e. <HI>Ziribabdas</HI> was called to receive a dead <HI>Sevarite,</HI> and open the Caves, in which the decea&s;ed lay in Coffins of Ivory and Gold. He excu&s;ed him&s;elf, and told me, that he had much more to &s;ay concerning the Religion of their Country, but could not remain with us any longer. I was glad to have this op|portunity to &s;ee their manner of burying the dead. At the great Gate of the Tem|ple &s;tood near a thou&s;and people with the friends of the decea&s;ed. When <HI>Ziribabdas</HI> came to them, one who &s;tood before the Corps and the Bearers, &s;poke to him in this
<PB N="81" REF="118">
manner, as was afterwards interpreted to me. <Q>Mo&s;t holy Prie&s;t, we have brought to you our Neighbour <HI>Suffarali,</HI> a good man, and a religious <HI>Sevarite,</HI> who hath often expre&s;&s;ed his Devotion in this place, and his re&s;pects to your Holine&s;s; we de|&s;ire that he may be admitted among&s;t the dead <HI>Sevarites,</HI> as he hath lived among&s;t them with re&s;pect and honour.</Q> <HI>Ziribab|das</HI> &s;ate him&s;elf down in an Ivory Chair adorned with many precious Stones, which &s;tood in the Porch, and then he called the Friends of the decea&s;ed, inquiring of them, whether he had committed no unworthy action in his life-time? Whether he had lived peaceably with his Neighbours? Whether he had not been privately guilty of drunkenne&s;s, &amp;c? Whether he had not at his departure bequeathed &s;omething to the Church? How many children he had? What were their names? And &s;uch like que&s;tions, to which they gave an an&s;wer, and &s;atisfied him fully. Afterwards they carried in the Corps into the Temple, and laid it upon a long Table of an Emerald|&s;tone, and the Prie&s;ts anointed the body all over with an excellent Oyl, called the Oyl of <HI>Botamine,</HI> which &s;ignifies in their Lan|guage Uncorruption: For &s;uch is its extra|ordinary
<PB N="82" REF="119">
virtue, that it keeps a body from all manner of corruption or alteration an hundred years. Now this is a Sacred Oyl, which only the Prie&s;ts, who are learned in Chymi&s;try, make of &s;everal Ingredients; for this cau&s;e it is no where to be found but in their Temples, unto which they have their Laboratories annexed. Now once in an hundred years they anoint over all the bodies of the decea&s;ed from the beginning of the World: by this means the bodies are kept fre&s;h, and &s;o lively and beautiful, that if a dead body could &s;tand upright, at a di&s;tance no man could di&s;tingui&s;h the dead from the living. When the body was well anointed, they opened a large Cave of a thou&s;and yards broad, and as many long. It had as many Clo&s;ets as there were hou&s;es in the City. <HI>Ziribabdas,</HI> at the opening of the mouth of the Cave, cau&s;ed &s;ome Cere|monies to be performed, and then marched down a pair of &s;tairs into this burying-place: the Corps was carried after him, and I and my Companions, with <HI>Sermodas,</HI> were admitted to behold the &s;ubterranean Rarities, and to walk up and down in the Caves, &s;o full of tran&s;parent &s;tones, that the light entring in by two or three holes, made on purpo&s;e, cau&s;ed it to be as light
<PB N="83" REF="119">
within, as if the Sun had &s;hined there in its Meridian. In the Cave were &s;ix hundred thou&s;and &s;eparations, capacious enough to hold above an hundred thou&s;and bodies: they were all laid one upon another in very good order. There were &s;everal Alleys and Walks between the &s;eparations, unto which were doors of ma&s;&s;ie Gold, and in &s;everal places &s;tood great Pots full of that Oyl of <HI>Botamine,</HI> which the Prie&s;ts ca&s;t up|on the bodies, when they perceive any al|teration in the bodies by their &s;melling. By this means it happens, that there is not the lea&s;t noi&s;om &s;mell; but there is every where the mo&s;t ble&s;&s;ed Perfume in every corner, as if you were in a Garden of Ro|&s;es, or among&s;t blooming Beans. When we had well viewed the Caves, I intreated <HI>Zi|ribabdas</HI> to &s;hew me the Sepulchres of their Kings; for that purpo&s;e he led us out at another door, when all the company was departed, and &s;hewed us all their Princes &s;itting in Chairs of State, as if they were alive; but this place was not in the Cave, but round about their Temple, in Clo&s;ets made on purpo&s;e. The Princes were all cloathed in their Royal Attire, which they change once every year; for that purpo&s;e the King that reigns is bound to &s;end them
<PB N="84" REF="120">
Ve&s;tments according to the ancient Cu|&s;tom. <HI>Ziribabdas</HI> &s;hewed us all the anci|ent Kings &s;itting in their gravity and Ma|je&s;ty, and pointed out to &s;ome who had been very remarkable in their Lives for &s;ome noted Actions, by which they had ob|liged the Nation of the <HI>Sevarites,</HI> and ren|dered their Names and Memories more &s;acred than others among&s;t their Po&s;terity. He &s;hewed us King <HI>Bormarti,</HI> who was &s;o great a Lover of Ju&s;tice, that he bani&s;hed his own Son for committing a fault, and &s;ent him to live and dye in the I&s;lands. He told of his King <HI>Robarmi,</HI> who invented the Art of Painting, and laid the Foundations of <HI>Sevarinde.</HI> He &s;hewed us the Body of King <HI>Darti,</HI> who built the &s;tately Palace for the Kings of the <HI>Sevarites,</HI> and fetched the &s;tones from the Diamant Rocks and the Mountains of Saphyr, at a great di&s;tance from thence, upon Carts driven with the Wind, with Sails as Ships. We &s;aw King <HI>Marati,</HI> who taught the <HI>Sevarites</HI> how to make Boats, and to fi&s;h in the Rivers. We &s;aw the Bodies of King <HI>Bumorli, Serabi, Cu&s;&s;ori, Menari, Mena&s;ti, Nacri, Labomor, Apolori, Ribolo, Staraki, Muraki, Amlorod,</HI> and many others, who had been reverenced for &s;ome witty Invention or glorious Acti|on,
<PB N="85" REF="120">
by which they had benefited Po&s;terity as well as their own Generation. There|fore their Clo&s;ets were more beautiful and richer than the re&s;t, and they had the Ho|nour to have their Images placed in the no|ted Rendezvous of the City, for all men to look upon them, and for all Po&s;terity to reverence and re&s;pect them. By this Ho|nour the &s;ucceeding Kings were the more incouraged to do good, and ab&s;tain from all blame; they are the more animated to de&s;erve well from their Generation, and to invent &s;omething to advantage their Peo|ple. We walked about to &s;ee all the Ra|rities of this Royal Sepulchre, which ex|ceeded in glory the riche&s;t and &s;tatelie&s;t Palaces of our <HI>European</HI> Emperours and Kings. To &s;peak of the rare Jewels, of the Gold and precious Stones, and of the ex|cellent things that were never brought over nor &s;een in our World, I &s;hould be end|le&s;s; for here in every place there are red, yellow, white, and other tran&s;parent Stones of rare Vertues, not known to us in <HI>Europe.</HI> Orient Pearls as big as Walnuts are as or|dinary as Pebble-&s;tones in our Country.

rarer and more glorious things to put a|bout their necks and bodies as Ornaments, than the&s;e things, which, for want of a name, I omit. <HI>Ziribabdas</HI> &s;hewed me next the Gallery of their &s;acred Hieroglyphicks, which is one of the rare&s;t things of the World. The Gallery is about half a mile long, joyning to the Temple, &s;tanding up|on an Arch, under which are beautiful Walks and Clo&s;ets, for the Learned Students in all Arts and Sciences to &s;pend their time, and imploy them&s;elves in their &s;earches in|to the My&s;teries of Nature. The Wall is of a white tran&s;parent &s;tone, as clear as Cry&s;tal, and the Gallery is paved with Dia|mant &s;tones &s;quare, at every &s;ix foot is a great large Window of Cry&s;tal, and the top is covered and arched over with Sa|phyr &s;tone. Emeralds, Chry&s;olytes, Rubies, Ja&s;pers, Beryls, and other precious Stones not known to us, are without number a|bout in the Walls. This Gallery was built in the year 3406. after the Creation of the World, by King <HI>Murabormati,</HI> a great Phi|lo&s;opher, and a Learned Student of Natures My&s;teries. In the&s;e Walls he cau&s;ed the Rules of all &s;orts of Sciences, and the Prin|ciples of all manner of Arts to be ingraven in black in the white &s;tone of the Walls,
<PB N="87" REF="122">
not in Characters, but in Figures and dark Enigmes and Repre&s;entations. Here I be|held the &s;hapes of all manner of Creatures of this and our World in all kind of po|&s;tures and actions of life, put here to repre|&s;ent the &s;acred My&s;teries thereby &s;ignified to the under&s;tanding Reader. In this Gal|lery were &s;everal hundred Learned Stu|dents beholding and &s;earching into the di|rections that were given them by the&s;e Hieroglyphicks. And in &s;ome Clo&s;ets, near adjoyning, were &s;everal companies of men di&s;cour&s;ing and di&s;puting about tho&s;e things which were repre&s;ented upon the Wall. We were introduced among&s;t them to look and &s;it with them, and ob&s;erve their grave po&s;tures and mien; but for their Learned Lectures and excellent Di&s;|cour&s;es, we under&s;tood nothing, only <HI>Sermo|das</HI> told us, that here were all the Wits and Learned men of the <HI>Sevarites</HI> gathered to|gether; and that for their better under|&s;tanding of all manner of Sciences, and to perpetuate Learning, and free it from for|getfulne&s;s, they had in the Gallery the Rules and Axioms of all Arts, with all the Definitions and other matters of any mo|ment, needful to be known in relation to any Skill or Science; and that when any
<PB N="88" REF="123">
Student doubted of any matter, in the&s;e Clo&s;ets the great Doctors were met to di|rect and teach the ignorant, and improve all Arts and Sciences; and that by degrees as they improved Learning by new Di&s;co|veries, they were always engraven upon the Walls, after a &s;erious and judicial Exami|nation of the Learned Doctors, and their Approbation of &s;uch invented things and Rules: which Hieroglyphicks were graven with the names of their Authors for a per|petual Memory. We walked three or four turns in the Gallery, and &s;aw &s;uch variety and number of new Objects and Repre&s;en|tations, that I have often wondered, how any one man can have that va&s;t memory to give an interpretation to all tho&s;e things of different &s;hapes, and to comprehend all the My&s;teries of &s;uch Enigmes. In &s;ome places of the Gallery the Wall was covered over with Plates of Silver, and the Hiero|glyphicks were of Gold; but generally they were in black upon a white clear &s;tone, and &s;o hard, that though, as I was informed by <HI>Zidi Parabas</HI> and the Prie&s;t, &s;ome of the Hieroglyphicks have been there put above a thou&s;and years ago, yet appear as fre&s;h, as if they had been gra|ven but ye&s;terday. At the end of the Gal|lery

are two large Cabinets, of a curious workman&s;hip, and rare &s;tone, of a reddi&s;h colour, mo&s;t beautiful to the eye, curiou&s;ly cut and graven. The Cabinets are full of Pictures and Images of all &s;orts of Crea|tures, which &s;erve the Learned in their Contemplations: here are al&s;o a great ma|ny Skeletons of many Animals, with all manner of rare things, which are to be found in this wonderful Country. Here I &s;aw a great Saphire &s;tone, about the bigne&s;s of a Goo&s;e, in which the Heavens and the Earth were repre&s;ented very lively to the eye. In an Emerald, about the bigne&s;s of a mans head, I found in one &s;ide all manner of Birds graven with the finger of Nature, and in the other all &s;orts of Bea&s;ts. I &s;aw &s;everal other precious Stones, one ha|ving the Image of a Man, another of a Hor&s;e, another of a Woman, another of a Camel, another of an Eagle, another of a River, another of a Fi&s;h, another of other Creatures, &s;o curiou&s;ly engraven, that no Arti&s;t could mend Natures work. The&s;e &s;tones were u&s;eful not only to &s;atisfie mens curio&s;ity, and plea&s;e the &s;ight of the Lear|ned; but al&s;o to teach them &s;everal things concerning tho&s;e creatures, which were thereby intimated to them. We found

&s;everal Learned men ob&s;erving tho&s;e things, and viewing them with lei&s;ure: For that purpo&s;e are &s;everal Seats for them to &s;it down and contemplate. Here I &s;aw al|&s;o many Tali&s;mans, an Art altogether lo&s;t in <HI>Europe,</HI> and not to be recovered but from the Learning of the <HI>Sevarites;</HI> for <HI>Zidi Pa|rabas</HI> &s;hewed me a round &s;tone, hollow within, wherein I &s;aw, through many parts of it tran&s;parent, a perpetual motion of Trees, Woods, wild Bea&s;ts, and many Ani|mals, which he told me, was but a Tali&s;|man made to direct &s;uch as are Learned in this Art, how to make others for the &s;ame purpo&s;e. Some are &s;o skilful, that with a Tali&s;man they will kill any bea&s;t or crea|ture at a mile di&s;tance; but as the <HI>Seva|rites</HI> are not for the de&s;truction of crea|tures, but for their pre&s;ervation, they never make u&s;e of this Art to do mi&s;chief, but &s;ave and comfort &s;uch creatures as are decaying, and to put life into tho&s;e that are dead. Only the venemous creatures and noi&s;om Flies, if by the procurement of any evil-&s;pirited, &s;uch are introduced into the Country, then the Philo&s;ophers have an Art to make &s;uch a Tali&s;man, as will not only de&s;troy the Flies, and di&s;arm the bea&s;t of his poy&s;onous and ill qualities; but

For this purpo&s;e I &s;aw upon four corners of the great Church a great Giant of black Marble, holding in his right hand a pair of Rams horns, as they appeared to me; but in truth it was no|thing but a Tali&s;man to keep off the Devils and evil Spirits from their Meeting-place and holy A&s;&s;embles. In his left hand he held a Book open, of white Marble, in which &s;ome Characters were graven, as I was told, which the Devils cannot endure to &s;ee, and therefore keep at a di&s;tance from &s;uch places. Be&s;ides, the&s;e Learned in Tali&s;manical Figures, have the Art to make tho&s;e Tali&s;mans as have an influence not only upon bodies corporeal, but al&s;o up|on the &s;ubtle Spirits of the Air, and will bind them to a good Behaviour, or drive them with vengeance off from the place, or el&s;e &s;o benum their &s;en&s;es, that they can nei|ther &s;tir nor move, but are as &s;o many ma|zed creatures, without life or motion, when they come within &s;uch a compa&s;s. For that purpo&s;e I &s;aw upon the top of the Temple a great Eagle of Gold &s;tanding with its wings abroad on the highe&s;t Pinacle of the Temple, which <HI>Ziribabdas</HI> told me, was no|thing
<PB N="92" REF="125">
but a Tali&s;man made to drive away all &s;ubtle Spirits of the Air, or to hinder their malicious intents in that Sacred place, and among&s;t the people of the City. He told me, that they have &s;ome per&s;ons &s;o well acquainted with that Art, that they can work wonders, and do any Miracle by their Tali&s;mans, kill and make alive, cure di&s;tempers, benum the minds and &s;en&s;es of men, draw together thou&s;ands of creatures and birds, and make them perform any action that may be named. I intreated <HI>Ziribabdas</HI> to let me &s;ee &s;ome of the skill of the&s;e Learned men in this Art. I im|portuned him &s;o much, that he went into one of the Clo&s;ets from the Gallery, and fetched to us a grave Signior about an hundred years of age, with a long beard reaching down to his knees, and a pair of large whiskers each near a foot long. He &s;aluted me very gravely, and led me into a private Clo&s;et, which belonged to him, out of it there was a way and a door into a &s;tone-Balcony, of a red tran&s;parent &s;tone, with &s;everal Bo&s;&s;es or Apples of Gold. He had &s;everal curious Inventions, Tali&s;mans, and other things of a wonderful Art. One thing he took in hand, about the bigne&s;s of a Bu&s;hel, having &s;everal handles to it, the
<PB N="93" REF="125">
&s;ub&s;tance, as I thought, was of Cry&s;tal: it had &s;everal large holes: in the mid&s;t I could &s;ee many birds, all without motion, till the grave Philo&s;opher, who&s;e name was <HI>Zidi Mufti,</HI> pulled a &s;tring, and &s;et them all in a motion, then did we hear the chirp|ing of all manner of birds, &s;o plea&s;antly, that we &s;tood in a maze and wondered; but much more, when we &s;aw all the birds of the Air, that can be named, flying a pace towards us into the Philo&s;ophers Clo&s;et: there were Eagles, Cormorants, Magpies, Crows, Vulturs, Jack-daws, Kites, Spar|rows, Falcons, &amp;c. I numbered above a thou&s;and, which in le&s;s than a quarter of an hour came into the Clo&s;et, and perched up|on the Balcony and upon the Gallery. When <HI>Zidi Mufti</HI> &s;aw them all come, he played another tune, and all the&s;e Birds be|gan to dance two and two, and chirp ac|cording to their kind, very plea&s;antly. This &s;port la&s;ted about an hour, with &s;uch a varie|ty of action, that we could have wi&s;hed it might have la&s;ted longer. At the conclu|&s;ion the Philo&s;opher di&s;mi&s;&s;ed them, nei|ther at that time did any of them injure one another, but were as quiet and harm|le&s;s, as if there had been no enmity between them. When they were gone, he took
<PB N="94" REF="126">
the Image of a man made in Wax; but &s;hewing all his privy parts backwards, and with it he marched to the Balcony, where he &s;ate up and &s;poke two or three hard words, to the be&s;t of my remembrance they were the&s;e, <HI>Bomralok Ko&s;traborab A|brolakar Bourakabou Branba&s;trokobar A|brovora Birikabu,</HI> and immediately there came a company of men and women of the <HI>Sevarites</HI> that danced all naked before us in a beautiful Green: whiles he held the Image in that place, they were not able to depart from thence, but continued playing and dancing, and &s;porting with one ano|ther above an hour, &s;hewing &s;uch antick tricks, as I never &s;aw the like; for all this they were not di&s;hone&s;t; but immediately as &s;oon as the Image di&s;appeared, every one of them departed and run away; but whiles the Image &s;tood &s;till, they were nei|ther a&s;hamed, nor could they &s;tir from the place, &s;o great a power the&s;e Tali&s;mans have upon the minds of men, as well as the bodies of bea&s;ts and birds. 'Tis an Art which can give as much delight as profit to tho&s;e that under&s;tand it well; for they can perform tho&s;e things in Nature that are mo&s;t wonderful, and advantageous to the life of man. In the fir&s;t Ages of the
<PB N="95" REF="126">
World this Art was generally known a|mong&s;t the Learned: and when I &s;aw how perfect the <HI>Sevarites</HI> were in it, I wi&s;hed with all my heart, that we had but &s;ome in&s;ight into the &s;ame Art and skill for the good of our Country; but our ignorance would &s;lander &s;uch knowledges, and think it to be Magick, if we did not under&s;tand the depth of it, nor the cau&s;es that &s;uch men &s;et a work, for many wonderful ef|fects are to be produced by the inferiour cau&s;es, which are &s;ecret and hid to the mo&s;t part of men; for &s;uch is our natural un|skilfulne&s;s, that we know not the hun|dredth part of tho&s;e things that we may ea&s;ily attain to. This Learned Philo&s;opher gave me another diver&s;ion: he fetched his In&s;trument for that purpo&s;e, and cau&s;ed &s;uch mu&s;ical Sounds and Voices to be in the Air round about us at a di&s;tance, that we began to hang between fear and plea|&s;ure. When <HI>Ziribabdas</HI> &s;aw a change in our countenance, he de&s;ired us to be con|tented, and a&s;&s;ured us, that we &s;hould re|ceive no harm. The noi&s;e and voices con|tinued half an hour, not in the In&s;trument, but at a di&s;tance, and with &s;uch a variety of Sounds, that I could never imagine what it was. For whiles he &s;tayed upon the Bal|cony,
<PB N="96" REF="127">
he turned the In&s;trument round with a little wheel, which was in the in&s;ide, but this had the power by the Tali&s;manical Art to cau&s;e in the Air &s;uch &s;hrieks, crys, hollowings, and &s;ometimes &s;uch curious and melodious voices, that we were ravi&s;hed and &s;truck into admiration. We de&s;ired to know what it was that made that noi&s;e in the Air; the Philo&s;opher told us, that they were airy Spirits, which this Tali&s;man had the power to attract, and to oblige to break out into tho&s;e &s;hrieks and crys. This cau&s;ed us to wonder the more, that this corporeal In&s;trument, which &s;eemed to have nothing but material, &s;hould draw together on a &s;udden &s;uch powerful Spi|rits, and oblige them to give &s;port to men. I concluded from the&s;e Examples, that he that under&s;tands well the Tali&s;manical Art, is able to do any thing in Nature, to work wonders and miracles, and to delight him|&s;elf with any kind of &s;port when he plea|&s;eth. After the&s;e pa&s;&s;ages, I &s;aw another Philo&s;opher, very well skilled in this curi|ous Art, bring before <HI>Sevarminas</HI> three&s;core Lions roaring, with an hundred Bears, twenty wild Hor&s;es, two hundred Ma&s;tiffs, thirty Leopards, forty wild Bulls, which he cau&s;ed fir&s;t to cry every one according to his
<PB N="97" REF="127">
cu&s;tom and nature, then the Philo&s;opher forced them to dance whiles he played up|on a mu&s;ical In&s;trument, and they per|formed this as exactly, as if they had been taught on purpo&s;e; but when he &s;aw his time, he &s;et them all together by the ears, the Dogs, the Lions, and the Bears, every one pitched upon his Enemy, and began a plea&s;ant Fight, which la&s;ted two full hours, with a great deal of variety of &s;port, which cau&s;ed <HI>Sevarminas</HI> and all his Court o&s;t|times to laugh heartily. When he hath a de&s;ire to take any &s;uch diver&s;ion, he &s;ends for &s;ome of the&s;e men skilled in the Ta|li&s;manical Art, and they an&s;wer his expe|ctations in all things, and bring before him whom, and what they plea&s;e. We retur|ned our thanks to this worthy Philo&s;opher for his great pains. He an&s;wered, that he was glad to give us any delight, and that if we would vi&s;it him at &s;ome other more convenient time, he would &s;hew us &s;ome more of his skill in acting greater won|ders, than what we had &s;een; but that he had done this only to divert us for the pre&s;ent, becau&s;e he &s;aw that we could not &s;tay with him long; but if we would &s;ee more wonderful things, that we &s;hould do well to come to him &s;ome morning, and
<PB N="98" REF="128">
to &s;pend a whole day with him, and that then he would &s;hew us what we had never &s;een, nor never &s;hould &s;ee but by his and his Companions means. We returned him our thanks again for his great kindne&s;s, and then departed with <HI>Ziribabdas,</HI> who led us next to &s;ee the Trea&s;ury of the Church, which is a large Room joyning to the Porch, all arched above, with &s;ix Win|dows on the top: the Walls were of Dia|mant, niched with Saphirs and Emeralds, in it were Che&s;ts and Coffers full of the rare&s;t things in Nature, offered to the &s;er|vice of the great God by the Citizens of <HI>Sevarinde.</HI> We beheld with admiration the rare workman&s;hip, the curious things, and the Excellencies that had been there laid up by many Ages, and never made u&s;e of. Some Pictures were upon the Walls of this Trea&s;ury, of an admirable hand: <HI>Ziribabdas</HI> told us, that the Painter was an <HI>European,</HI> ca&s;t upon their Coa&s;ts by a &s;torm at Sea, and that he lived and dyed in that Country; and that the Father of <HI>Sevarminas</HI> had &s;uch an affection for him, that he gave him a beautiful young Virgin to Wife, one of the mo&s;t con&s;iderable of his Court, and gave him an E&s;tate to live on, having made him a Citizen of <HI>Sevarinde:</HI> and that he
<PB N="99" REF="128">
lived there fifty years, till he was an old man, leaving behind him many children, Girls and Boys, to perpetuate his name among&s;t the <HI>Sevarites.</HI> His name was <HI>Si|meon van Zurich,</HI> a <HI>Dutch</HI> man, who had a great skill in Swimming; for when he was ca&s;t away, all the Ships company was lo&s;t, but only him: they were at a di&s;tance from the &s;hore, and could not &s;o well &s;wim, or were devoured by the fi&s;hes. It was his fortune to be carried &s;tark naked on the Coa&s;t of the <HI>Sevarites,</HI> in an I&s;land full of Ladies of Plea&s;ure, who had been bani&s;hed thither for their incontinency. As &s;oon as it was day, he found him&s;elf &s;urrounded by a whole Troop of the female Sex, who had a great delight to &s;ee him, and came to draw him into the Country; but when he &s;aw no men, he was afraid to venture a|mong&s;t them: this cau&s;ed him to &s;wim up the River into the Land in the &s;ight of the&s;e beautiful Creatures that accompanied on the &s;hore, and often made &s;igns to him to land, and go no further; but he continued on till he landed among&s;t the innocent <HI>Se|varambi,</HI> who cloathed and brought him to their King. He was by him entertained courteou&s;ly and nobly, and provided for the re&s;t of his days. When we had taken
<PB N="100" REF="129">
notice of the Trea&s;ury, and of all the great Rarities that are in it, we marched into the Church or Temple again to &s;ee the excel|lent Workman&s;hip, the Carving, and rare things that adorn this excellent place. <HI>Ziribabdas</HI> cau&s;ed us to take notice of three Partitions in the Temple, the one, which is at the higher end, is only for their Prie&s;ts and their King: the &s;econd is for their No|bles: the third is for all &s;orts of per&s;ons promi&s;cuou&s;ly without exception. By that time we had &s;een all this, the night drew on apace, which cau&s;ed us to withdraw to|wards our Lodgings. <HI>Zidi Parabas</HI> led me, and <HI>Sermodas</HI> went with <HI>Maurice,</HI> our other Companions followed us to our Lodgings. We took our leaves of the generous and civil <HI>Ziribabdas,</HI> the Chief Prie&s;t of that &s;tately and glorious Cathedral-Temple of <HI>Sevarinde,</HI> and thanked him heartily for his great courte&s;ie &s;hewed to us. When we came to our Lodgings, we found our Sup|per ready, and we were no le&s;s prepared for it; but <HI>Zidi Parabas</HI> returned to the Palace, to give <HI>Sevarminas</HI> an account of his Commi&s;&s;ion and of our Walk, promi|&s;ing to return to us the next day. <HI>Sermodas,</HI> my &s;elf, and Companions &s;upped that night together, the Mu&s;ick playing all the while
<PB N="101" REF="129">
we were eating. After Supper we had good &s;tore of rare Wines brought to us, which we received and made good u&s;e of; but, as we under&s;tood, that the <HI>Sevarites</HI> hate Drunkards and drunkenne&s;s, I advi&s;ed all my Companions to drink moderately, for fear of giving an offence to tho&s;e noble people. They followed my advice, and after an hour or two's di&s;cour&s;e with <HI>Sermo|das,</HI> we went to our beds, where we had been the night before. <HI>Sermodas</HI> brought us into the Chamber, and then bid us good night, telling us, that he would call us up the next day, and &s;hew us &s;ome other di|ver&s;ions, as plea&s;ant as tho&s;e of the day be|fore. We thanked him, and told him, that we &s;hould be ready to wait upon him, and that we had &s;een &s;o many wonders al|ready, that we thought that we could ne|ver &s;ee any more: at tho&s;e words he de|parted &s;miling.</P>
<P>The next morning <HI>Zidi Parabas</HI> and <HI>Sermodas,</HI> with twenty more Gentlemen of the Kings Court, came to attend upon us, <HI>Sermodas</HI> only entring the room, the re&s;t &s;tayed in a Chamber hard by till we were dre&s;&s;ed. As &s;oon as we were ready, two Fellows, with Flutes in their hands, ready to play, &s;aluted us, offering to conduct us
<PB N="102" REF="130">
to the company that &s;tayed for us: they marched before us, making mo&s;t curious Mu&s;ick, till we came to the company. A grave Signior of them &s;tood with <HI>Zidi Pa|rabas,</HI> and told us, that we mu&s;t that day ride with <HI>Sevarminas</HI> into the Country, and that he had &s;ent them to call upon us for that purpo&s;e. <HI>Sermodas</HI> had cau&s;ed &s;ome of the excellent Wines of the Country to be brought, he cau&s;ed &s;ome to be poured forth into a great &s;hell of a Fi&s;h, which is the ordinary Drinking ve&s;&s;els of that Coun|try. He cau&s;ed us to ta&s;te of it, and obli|ged all the company, before we went out, to pledge us: which when we had done, <HI>Zidi Parabas</HI> led us to the door, where we &s;aw as many Dromedaries ready &s;adled as we were men: we mounted upon them that were prepared for us; but when I inqui|red for a Bridle, they bid me take hold of the Ears; for in this Country the&s;e Crea|tures have Ears of an incredible length, they are commonly an Ell long, but very &s;lender: &s;o that they are fa&s;tened together as the Reins of a Bridle, at the end, with a Cla&s;p, or &s;ome &s;uch thing. This men hold in their hands, and with this they govern or turn them at their plea&s;ure. I mu&s;t confe&s;s, I was afraid when I was fir&s;t moun|ted
<PB N="103" REF="130">
upon this &s;trange bea&s;t, which is &s;o &s;wift, that in a day we rid over hedges and ditches and uneven places, above one hun|dred and fifty miles. We went through the &s;treets to the Kings Palace, where we attended not long before there came out a great Train with <HI>Sevarminas</HI> him&s;elf, I and my Companions alighted to &s;alute and do him reverence. He inquired how we had thrived, whether we wanted any thing; we a&s;&s;ured him, that among&s;t &s;o courteous and obliging a People as his Subjects were, we thought that we could not po&s;&s;ibly want any manner of thing needful for the life of man. He bid us get up again and ride a|long with him, we were in all near a thou|&s;and, all on &s;wift Dromedaries: the Kings was as white as Snow, all the re&s;t either red or black. It &s;eems <HI>Sermodas</HI> had given the King an account of the pa&s;&s;ages of the for|mer day: &s;o that, to increa&s;e the more our wonder, he was re&s;olved to &s;hew us the ex|cellency of his Country, and many other rare things; for that purpo&s;e he had ap|pointed in our Road towards the Confines, all the ingenious men to meet us at every Town with their Tali&s;mans in their hands ready to &s;hew us their skill and &s;port. We had not gone above two Leagues South|ward,
<PB N="104" REF="131">
but we came to a Town called by the <HI>Sevarites Magmandi,</HI> where thirty Philo&s;o|phers met the King; and to welcome him, they had a Tali&s;man ready to make a Lou&s;e grow in an in&s;tant as big as a Camel. I &s;aw the bea&s;t, and admired how &s;uch things could be done by a man, and as they told me, that they did it by the natural cau&s;es alone, without the concurrence of any other thing. As &s;oon as the Philo&s;opher had turned the Lou&s;e into a Camel, he mounted upon it, and offered his &s;ervice to <HI>Sevar|minas</HI> to wait upon him in his Progre&s;s, which was accepted. And if I &s;hould &s;ay, that this &s;trange Camel gallopped, or ra|ther flew, as fa&s;t as any of our Dromeda|ries, &s;carce any per&s;on will believe it: yet true it is, that this new-made creature led the way before us, and returned back with <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span"> the wing no &s;igns of being weary: in|<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span"> Provender the Philo&s;opher had <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span"> him&s;elf with a bottle of Spirits, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span"> he would &s;ometimes, as I took <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span">, pour into the Camels Ears, and-by that means kept the bea&s;t alive and vigorous. Another of the&s;e Philo&s;ophers had got a Flea in his hand, which, with an Image of Wax, he turned into a Dromedary, &s;o like that which the King was upon, that I could
<PB N="105" REF="131">
not tell how to di&s;tingui&s;h them. I &s;aw the Flea which he held in a &s;ilken &s;tring, he &s;hewed it to all our company, and before us, by an application of the Tali&s;manical Fi|gure, the Flea began to dilate it &s;elf into the body of a Camel, and out of the body the legs and ears and head broke out almo&s;t like a Snail when it goes to creep, or like a Tor|toi&s;e. All this was done in le&s;s than a quarter of an hour. He al&s;o had a Saddle ready to ride along with us in the compa|ny of the King and his Nobles. I confe&s;s, I took the&s;e two Learned <HI>Sevarites</HI> for Con|jurers, if not for Devils in mens &s;hape. When <HI>Zidi Parabas</HI> perceived in our way, that <HI>Maurice</HI> whi&s;pered to me, he drew near to me, and a&s;&s;ured me, that they could do more wonderful Feats than that by their great Art, and that what they had done, was done by the &s;ecret power of na|tural cau&s;es, &s;et on work by the influence of the Tali&s;man. I told him, that I could wi&s;h, that we in our Country had the &s;ame skill and knowledge: but he an&s;wered, That &s;uch My&s;teries are not fit but for men of the mo&s;t refined Wits, and that no dull or vicious apprehen&s;ions can be capable of the &s;ublime Notions that &s;uch men mu&s;t have to act &s;uch Wonders, and to find out
<PB N="106" REF="132">
the way to make &s;uch &s;trange Tali&s;mans. Another of the&s;e Philo&s;ophers, who &s;tood within &s;ome golden Rails adjoyning to the High-way, had in his hand a naked Image of Wax, repre&s;enting a young Girl, which Image he turned about his head, with &s;ome hard words which he uttered out of his mouth, and immediately there came to the place all the young Maidens within a cer|tain di&s;tance, and threw off their garments with their mode&s;ty, in my judgment; but the religious <HI>Sevarites</HI> are not a&s;hamed to behold what Nature teaches other men to cover. The&s;e Maidens leaped over the Rails about three&s;core in number, and began a mo&s;t plea&s;ant Dance upon the green gra&s;s before all our company, the Philo&s;opher having appointed a Mu&s;ician ready for that purpo&s;e, who played all the while upon his In&s;trument of Mu&s;ick, ac|cording to which the&s;e Maidens leaped and danced up and down, which gave <HI>Se|varminas</HI> much &s;port and to all his Court; but when the Philo&s;opher began to turn away, and cover the waxen Image, they took all their garments again, and departed with much &s;atisfaction, becau&s;e they had given &s;ome delight to their Prince, whom all the <HI>Sevarites</HI> reverence as they do a vi&s;i|ble
<PB N="107" REF="132">
God; they are therefore very joyful, when they can do any thing to plea&s;e and delight him. The re&s;t of the Philo&s;ophers &s;hewed every one in his turn what he was able to do. One held a Mou&s;e by the tail in one hand, and his Tali&s;man in the other, and threw the Mou&s;e behind <HI>Sevarminas</HI> upon his Dromedary, which as &s;oon as it was there, but a moment, it had the power to attract one of the mo&s;t beautiful Vir|gins, whom I &s;aw &s;traggling behind the King. This thing cau&s;ed the whole com|pany to bur&s;t out in laughter; for &s;he was ju&s;t putting on her Apparel with the re&s;t of her Companions, when the Tali&s;man tyed her hands and feet, and drew her on a &s;udden, &s;o that &s;he was &s;een to leap all naked through the mid&s;t of us behind the King, where &s;he remained till the Philo&s;o|pher drew her back with the Tali&s;man, and cau&s;ed her to put on her cleaths and de|part. Another of the&s;e Makers of Tali&s;|mans was blowing with a Pipe at the breech of a Cat, which &s;welled bigger than any Elephant: when therefore he &s;aw his time, he turned the tail towards the company, and by a &s;ecret Tali&s;man gave liberty to the wind to go &s;oftly out by the &s;ame hole where it was put in. The noi&s;e was &s;o de|lightful,
<PB N="108" REF="133">
that I never heard more variety and &s;weoter Mu&s;ick in my days; for the Philo&s;opher &s;troked the Cats back and belly, and as he pre&s;&s;ed it harder or &s;ofter, the wind would go out and whi&s;tle all &s;orts of Tunes. The King him&s;elf and all the company de&s;ired the Learned man to come to Court as &s;oon as he &s;hould re|turn, and give them that &s;port, which they fancied very much. I looked upon the Cat, whether it was alive, and I &s;aw that it was a natural Cat, much like the Civet-Cats; for be&s;ides the Mu&s;ick, the Air was filled with &s;uch excellent and glorious &s;mells, that we were all ravi&s;hed and in a maze, how this could come to pa&s;s. All the re&s;t &s;hewed &s;ome trick or other, but for brevity &s;ake I omit them, to give an account of our Journey. I cannot here de&s;cribe the number of beautiful Fabricks, of Orchards full of all manner of Fruit|trees, Gardens with all kind of Flowers, Herbs, and Plants, both delightful to the eye, and u&s;eful to the body. I cannot num|ber all the other Rarities and Riches which this Country was full of, with the plea&s;ant Chanels of Cry&s;tal-water, with the Bridges and Arches in our way, with the many Towns walled and open, mo&s;t of precious
<PB N="109" REF="133">
Stones, and adorned with Gold and Silver, and Ivory, and all manner of Riches. If I &s;hould give a particular account, no per|&s;on can believe, unle&s;s he had been him&s;elf an Eye-witne&s;s of the things that we &s;aw then in our Journey. We went through <HI>Para&s;cali,</HI> a good Town, where the River <HI>Omer</HI> joyns with <HI>Rocara.</HI> The Inhabitants were &s;o civil, that they met the King with rich Tables of Gold, covered all over with Di&s;hes of Sweet-meats, of a <HI>China</HI> &s;ub&s;tance and make. Every Cavaliero had liberty to take what plea&s;ed him be&s;t. Whiles we &s;tayed there, &s;ome Philo&s;ophers &s;tood in our way to give us &s;ome of the former &s;ports: at la&s;t he that was mounted upon his Camel, made of a Lou&s;e, cau&s;ed two great wings to grow out at the back, by the means of a Tali&s;man, which he had brought with him in his hand. As &s;oon as they were perfected, the Camel flew up to the top of the great Steeple of the Tem|ple of <HI>Para&s;cali,</HI> where it &s;tood a while with the Philo&s;opher on its back: at la&s;t it returned to us again without any harm either to the bea&s;t or the man. The next Town was <HI>Moramir,</HI> the third <HI>Storax,</HI> the fourth <HI>Bolaciro,</HI> the fifth <HI>Memrak,</HI> the &s;ixth <HI>Burino,</HI> where we &s;topt to take a Dinner
<PB N="110" REF="134">
prepared for us. I mu&s;t not forget to mention certain Images that &s;tood in the High-way, at the entring in of the Town; there were two chief, a young Maid of Alaba&s;ter, and a Man of white Marble. The Philo&s;ophers Camel would not go beyond them, till he began to prick the bea&s;t for|ward with a Tali&s;man. If it had not been for this accident, I &s;hould not have taken &s;o much notice of them, nor inquired after the cau&s;e of their being there. <HI>Zidi Para|bas</HI> gave me full &s;atisfaction, and told me, that they were the Images of two unfortu|nate Lovers of the Town of <HI>Burino,</HI> who had been con&s;tant to one another, till death &s;eparated them, their love and con&s;tant affection cau&s;ed their deaths: For it hap|pened, that their Parents would not con+&s;ent to their conjunction, which they dared not agree to without their leave, and the publick Solemnity, for fear of the di&s;grace which u&s;ually, as a con&s;equence, attends upon &s;uch kind of amorous indi&s;cretions in the Country of the <HI>Sevarites.</HI> They were therefore re&s;olved to love one another ten|derly, and to refu&s;e all other Matches and Proffers. They had been often tempted with other Propo&s;als, and with the Beauty and Riches of other Parties; but <HI>Ziricus</HI>
<PB N="111" REF="134">
and <HI>Malimna,</HI> &s;o were they named by <HI>Zidi Parabas,</HI> flighted all things but the &s;ight and company of one another, which they would endeavour to injoy by &s;tealth, be|cau&s;e they were narrowly watched by their jealous Parents, who by no means would &s;uffer them to come near together with their good will. Their love by this re|&s;traint increa&s;ed more and more, and their mutual affection found many Tricks and Arts to meet together in &s;pight of their Parents watchfulne&s;s. They found many back doors and &s;ecret corners, to which their extraordinary Sympathy brought them together: yet they would not be per|&s;waded to violate the Law of the <HI>Sevarites.</HI> This Love continued near forty years with a con&s;tancy worthy to be chronicled; yet their Parents would never con&s;ent to their Marriage. At la&s;t when they &s;aw, that neither their affection, nor their re&s;olution never to change could prevail upon their cruel Parents, and their invincible ob&s;tina|cy, they con&s;ulted betwixt them&s;elves to depart together out of the Kingdom, and to marry in &s;ome other Land. Whiles they were in this re&s;olution, they knew not which way to go, becau&s;e the pa&s;&s;ages were narrowly guarded. At a meeting there|fore,
<PB N="112" REF="135">
an old crafty Devil appears to them in the likene&s;s of a man, and offers them his &s;ervice to a&s;&s;i&s;t them over the Seas. They agreed for a price to be tran&s;ported to an I&s;land not inhabited, upon the Pacifick Sea, with &s;ome Tools, and grain for their maintenance. The Devil, in the &s;hape of a <HI>Sevarite,</HI> promi&s;ed to bring them a Ship in the dead time of the night to the great River of <HI>Rocara;</HI> for they thought he had been &s;ome Sea-man or Ship-ma&s;ter. The time and place of departing was appointed. The young Couple, according to their in|gagement, came to the place a little before the evening; and when they &s;aw that the Devil was rough to them, and had cloven feet, they began to &s;u&s;pect, yet they were &s;o pa&s;&s;ionate for one another, and there|fore &s;o blind, that the woman fir&s;t ventured her &s;elf in the Arms of the Devil to be car|ried through the water to the Ship, which they &s;aw in the River: the young man in|tending to follow next; but the wicked Devil, in&s;tead of conveying the young Vir|gin &s;afe aboard, plunged and held her un|der water till &s;he was &s;tifled and dead, and that in &s;ight of her Sweet-heart, who as &s;oon as he heard her begin to &s;hriek, and &s;aw what was practi&s;ing again&s;t her life

and his, it is not to be imagined what torments and trouble of mind he was in, &s;ometimes with his Sword in his hand he ran into the water up to the neck, again he would return up to the bank, to &s;ee whe|ther his dearly Beloved was yet alive, again he would run into the River, till at la&s;t, when he perceived the wickedne&s;s of the counterfeit Devil, he ca&s;t him&s;elf ce&s;pe|rately into the River; and though he had never any skill to &s;wim, his love for his Beloved, for whom he had a more tender affection than for his own &s;oul, made him venture, and found a means to get as far as the body of his murdered Darling, which he brought a&s;hore, and &s;eeing no &s;ign of life, he killed him&s;elf, and fell upon her body. In remembrance of this Tragedy the Town hath dedicated the&s;e two Images, the one to <HI>Ziricus,</HI> and the other to <HI>Ma|limna,</HI> with a great many le&s;&s;er Images of young Men and Maidens, that are all weep|ing for the misfortune of the&s;e two con&s;tant Lovers. This &s;tory <HI>Zidi Parabas</HI> told me, whiles the Dinner was bringing in to the great Hall of Ivory, where the King <HI>Sevar|minas</HI> was to dine with all his Court. When we were &s;ate down, we had all things need|ful pre&s;ented before us, with a Concert of
<PB N="114" REF="136">
Mu&s;ick mingled with rare Voices of &s;ome Virgins of the City. After this, a Philo&s;o|pher brought in a Silver Chain, a great white Rat, about the bigne&s;s of a good Rabbet, which leaped upon the Table near <HI>Sevarminas,</HI> and looked wi&s;hfully upon him when he was eating; but when the Rat &s;aw that the King &s;aid nothing, the Rat reached forth its paw or foot, and took &s;ome of the meat. The King was not a little &s;urpri&s;ed with the Rats boldne&s;s: How now! &s;aid he, did your Ma&s;ter teach you this? The Philo&s;opher by the Tali&s;ma|nical Art could make it &s;peak what he li&s;t|ed, for he could govern the tongue of the little creature in that manner, that what was in his mind the bea&s;t would &s;peak: By your leave, my Lord, quoth the Rat to the King, I am hungry. The Rats &s;peech &s;ur|pri&s;ed the King, and all the company left their meat to hear the di&s;cour&s;e between the King and the Rat; for the Philo&s;opher told his Maje&s;ty, That it would give him any an&s;wer that he would de&s;ire. They not knowing from whence it proceeded no more than we, they &s;tood to &s;ee what the Rat would &s;ay: the Rat was neither a&s;ha|med, nor afraid of the company, but went from one di&s;h to another to ta&s;te which was
<PB N="115" REF="136">
the be&s;t; it met with an O&s;trich-Pye, on which it fell aboard without any manners: the King bid it be gone, I'le fill my belly fir&s;t, an&s;wered the Rat, now I am here. <HI>King,</HI> I command thee to be gone. <HI>Rat,</HI> I love this company too well to run away in ha&s;te. <HI>King,</HI> Make ha&s;te. <HI>Rat,</HI> We mu&s;t do nothing ra&s;hly. <HI>King,</HI> Thou wilt eat all. <HI>Rat,</HI> There is enough in the Land for you and me too. <HI>King,</HI> Who tutored thee? <HI>Rat,</HI> My Ma&s;ter. Several other di&s;cour&s;es pa&s;t between <HI>Sevarminas</HI> and this artificial creature, which was made to &s;peak, not by its own under&s;tanding, but by that of the Philo&s;opher only; by the Ta|li&s;manical Art he could make u&s;e of the organ and tongue of the Rat to &s;peak what was according to his mind. This was a cu|rious pa&s;&s;age, and gave the whole company great delight. The Philo&s;opher told <HI>Sevar|minas,</HI> That he could make any bea&s;t, that was tame, to &s;peak in that manner, and &s;ay any thing. We found this to be too true; for afterwards another Learned man had taught a Camel, another an A&s;s, another a Dromedary, another a tame Lion to &s;ay any thing, with as much rea&s;on, as if they had been rational creatures, whereas it was but the organ of their tongue that was
<PB N="116" REF="137">
made u&s;e of by the &s;trong power of a Ta|li&s;man to turn which way, and articulate what&s;oever the Author of the Tali&s;man plea&s;ed. We &s;tayed not long in the place; but as &s;oon as we had all dined, and refre&s;hed our &s;elves, we mounted upon our Drome|daries, and went on in our Journey. The Lou&s;e, Camel, and the Flea turned into a Dromedary, going with us in our company, we pa&s;&s;ed by a curious Town that &s;tood up|on an Hill, which had a plentiful &s;tream of water ri&s;ing from the top, and falling from a &s;teep place upon a Diamant Rock, and then incompa&s;&s;ed the Hill round with a deep Chanel, over which there was a cu|rious Bridge of precious Stones, with Silver Globes on the top, and the &s;ides of the Walls with a mo&s;t beautiful Arch, the mo&s;t regularly built that I ever knew. The Towns name is <HI>Tiftani,</HI> commanded by a Prince, the mo&s;t con&s;iderable of all the Sub|jects of <HI>Sevarminas,</HI> he came out to meet us with a beautiful Guard of young Gallants, all cloathed in Cloth of Silver. The Prin|ce&s;s al&s;o came to the entring in of the Town with a beautiful Attendance of Ladies in their rich Attire covered over with Pearls, and the riche&s;t and mo&s;t precious Stones. They made a low obei&s;ance to King <HI>Se|varminas,</HI>
<PB N="117" REF="137">
and offered him the Keys of their City, which he returned to the Prince <HI>Mu|raski:</HI> that was the name of the Prince, who was young, about the age of thirty years. We pa&s;&s;ed through the &s;treets through the Acclamations and Applau&s;es of all the Common people, that are the happie&s;t in the World in all re&s;pects; for they pay but little or no Tribute, and have all things in &s;uch abundance, glory, and plenty, that there is no want nor complaints in all the Land, the poore&s;t <HI>Sevarite</HI> hath enough, and the riche&s;t can have no more than they u&s;e, for all the re&s;t is &s;uperfluous. The next Town was <HI>Tiptanicar,</HI> where upon an high Tower &s;tood a Tali&s;man of Gold, for what intent I could never learn. We went through <HI>Muramni, Bora&s;cot, Malavi&s;i,</HI> and &s;everal other good walled Towns in our way. We lodged that night in one of the Kings Palaces, &s;ituate in a little Lake, a|bout ten miles in compa&s;s, in an I&s;land that &s;tands in the middle. Several Boats and Ve&s;&s;els waited for us to convey us and our Dromedaries over to the I&s;land. This place is one of the mo&s;t plea&s;ant abodes of the World. Here we &s;top'd above a fortnight, which we &s;pent &s;ometimes in fi&s;hing, &s;ome|times in hunting, walking about, and admi|ring
<PB N="118" REF="138">
the wonderful things that appeared every where. Sometimes the Kings Philo&s;o|phers together with the Mu&s;icians, would make us &s;uch good &s;port, that we were never weary, we could have &s;pent the days and the nights in &s;eeing &s;uch &s;ports and pa&s;&s;|times. <HI>Sevarminas</HI> all this while &s;ent for me often, with <HI>De Nuits</HI> and <HI>Maurice,</HI> to di&s;cour&s;e with us, and inform him&s;elf con|cerning the Affairs, Commodities, and Conveniencies of our Country: in which particulars I always gave him &s;uch an&s;wers as would increa&s;e his de&s;ire to entertain a Trade and Corre&s;pondency with our Na|tion, and the other People of <HI>Europe.</HI> When we had lived here in this Ca&s;tle, and plea|&s;ant I&s;land called the I&s;le of Foxes, and in the <HI>Sevarites</HI> Language <HI>Cri&s;tako,</HI> we &s;et for|ward for another place called the Mount <HI>Timpani,</HI> where the Kings of the <HI>Sevarites</HI> have another Hou&s;e of Plea&s;ure: it is about an hundred Leagues di&s;tant towards the Southwe&s;t from <HI>Cri&s;tako.</HI> We pa&s;&s;ed through many Woods, Vallies, and an open Coun|try in our way to it, and had the &s;ight of &s;everal rare Towns, <HI>Seravi, Puteoli, Nanti, Quarok, Runtour,</HI> and &s;everal others no le&s;s rich and beautiful than the former. I cannot forget to mention a rare Invention which I
<PB N="119" REF="138">
&s;aw at <HI>Seravi.</HI> There is a large River about two miles di&s;tant from the Town, which &s;tands upon a Hill without any water. The ingenious <HI>Sevarites</HI> therefore have found an Art to convey this great River in an artifi|cial Chanel, built and &s;upported upon an Arch of hard Diamant &s;tone, above two miles from one Hill to the other, over a deep Valley, into which the River did run before; but becau&s;e the Valley was not &s;o whole&s;om an Air as the top of the Moun|tain, they have built there their hou&s;es, and been at the trouble to make for the River an artificial Chanel, &s;o deep, that Boats of an hundred Tun can &s;ail up and down in the drie&s;t time of Summer; for there is &s;carce any mud or dirt in the Chanel over the Valley: the water is as clear as Cry|&s;tal.</P>
<P>In another Town called <HI>Runtour,</HI> there was a company of Apes met us at the entry in of the Town: they were &s;o bold, that they leapt upon the backs of our Drome|daries, and put us in no little danger to be ca&s;t to the ground. But one of our Philo|&s;ophers pulled out of his pocket a &s;trange Tali&s;man, of a yellow colour, through which there was a hole which he clapt to his lips, and whi&s;tled away the Apes. They
<PB N="120" REF="139">
were not gone ten paces from us, but they all fell down dead with the venemous Spi|rits which this Tali&s;man conveyed to them without hurting any creature el&s;e; for you mu&s;t know, that what is a poy&s;on to one creature, is not &s;o to another, and the&s;e skill|ful men &s;o well read in the &s;ecret My&s;teries of Nature, can direct their operations which way they plea&s;e, at a di&s;tance as well as near at hand. The King of the <HI>Seva|rites</HI> hath always one or more of the&s;e Phi|lo&s;ophers to accompany him when he goes into the Country, for fear any accident might happen to his Per&s;on or Retinue.</P>
<P>We found a plentiful Dinner prepared for us at <HI>Nanti,</HI> where the Ladies of the Town waited upon <HI>Sevarminas</HI> at the Ta|ble, and came to the re&s;t of his Company to offer their Services. The Governors name was <HI>Forabo,</HI> an old grave Signior near four&s;core years of age, he had twenty Sons comely and proper young men, with five Daughters, all by one Woman, who&s;e name was <HI>Pluralis:</HI> &s;he was then a grave Matron of a beautiful and grave countenance, her Daughters young Ladies followed her when &s;he came to &s;alute <HI>Sevarminas</HI> and his Lords. We made no long &s;tay in this place, but marched next to the Mount <HI>Timpani,</HI> but
<PB N="121" REF="139">
could not get thither till the next day at night; we lodged therefore in the Town of <HI>Durambi,</HI> and the next day early in the morning we &s;et forward in our Journey to mount <HI>Timpani,</HI> where we arrived about Sun-&s;et. There happened nothing in this days riding remarkable, only <HI>Maurices</HI> Dromedary being offended that he had kicked her with his heel, ca&s;t him to the ground, and brui&s;ed his thigh and arm; but the Kings Phy&s;ician applying an Herb called <HI>Muroz,</HI> which he found in the fields hard by, cured the wound, ea&s;ed him pre|&s;ently of his pain, &s;o that he never com|plained afterwards. The nature of the&s;e creatures is &s;uch, that they mu&s;t be gently dealt withal, otherwi&s;e they become fu|rious and mad: but if the Rider handles them &s;oftly, there is no bea&s;t &s;o gentle, &s;o ea&s;ie, and u&s;eful.</P>
<P>Mount <HI>Timpani</HI> is a plea&s;ant Hill crown|ed on the top with all manner of the mo&s;t beautiful Trees in Nature, bearing all &s;orts of Fruits. In the mid&s;t is the Kings Palace moted round. The water runs from &s;ix great Fountains, which are on the top of the Hill, unto which there is an ea&s;ie a&s;cent on the &s;ide of the Hill: about half a mile from the Ca&s;tle is a Town of the &s;ame
<PB N="122" REF="140">
name, very glorious to the eye when the Sun &s;hines. The Ca&s;tle or the Kings Pa|lace is about a mile in circumference, with &s;trong Walls of clear &s;tones, of a white and reddi&s;h colour, &s;uch as I never &s;aw the like before. It was well furni&s;hed with all manner of Hou&s;hold-&s;tuff, the riche&s;t that I ever beheld: the large and &s;pacious Rooms, Chambers, and Halls, and Galle|ries, with their Ornaments, were not to be numbered. At our fir&s;t arrival, the Governor of the Town, with the chief In|habitants, came to wait upon their King, who &s;hewed them a great deal of re&s;pect as belonged to his loving Subjects. All this while he had concealed the cau&s;e of his Journey to that place, and would not let any per&s;on, not his own Son, nor any of his Privy Coun&s;ellors under&s;tand any thing of it, till three or four days after our arrival; for it becomes a great Prince, who intends to act &s;ecurely in weighty matters, not to let any man, not his greate&s;t Friends, know his intentions to the full. <HI>Sevarminas</HI> ha|ving here a great bu&s;ine&s;s to put in execu|tion, which concerned nothing le&s;s than the &s;afety and peace of his Empire, he concealed it from all the world, and gave out, that he would make this Progre&s;s for
<PB N="123" REF="140">
his pa&s;time and for his health. The Go|vernors name was <HI>Smuriamnas,</HI> a man of an ancient Family, lineally de&s;cended from the great <HI>Sevarias,</HI> but young and very ambitious, and no le&s;s proud and haughty among&s;t his Equals, which cau&s;ed his Peo|ple not to affect him &s;o much as otherwi&s;e they would have done. At our arrival he came to pay his Homage and Re&s;pects to <HI>Sevarminas</HI> his Prince, and the next day invited him and all the Court to a co&s;tly and &s;umptuous Banquet. I and my Com|panions, together with <HI>Sermodas</HI> and <HI>Zidi Parabas,</HI> were lodged in a &s;pacious Cham|ber, where were twenty Beds of Ivory and Gold, with curious Curtains of Silk em|broidered with Gold, with the Walls hung with Pictures, very well and artificially drawn. After Supper we went to take our leaves of King <HI>Sevarminas,</HI> and were immediately conducted to our Chamber, where we re&s;ted &s;weetly, till the next mor|ning the noi&s;e of the Trumpets, Bag-pipes, Flutes, Viols, and Violins, Harps, Guitars, and all manner of Mu&s;ick played at the Kings ri&s;ing. This plea&s;ant and ravi&s;hing Harmony awakened us and our Chamber|fellows, and obliged us to put on our Ap|parel. We walked about the Chamber a
<PB N="124" REF="141">
while, di&s;cour&s;ing of the &s;trange pa&s;&s;ages of our Journey, when in came a Me&s;&s;enger from the King to call us to him. He had an intent to walk about his Parks, and view the Town before Dinner. He was therefore willing, that we Strangers might go along with him, not only for our &s;ati&s;|faction, but al&s;o to &s;hew his People men of foreign Nations come to adore and wor|&s;hip him. The Parks were all walled round with many Lakes, Ponds, Rivers, and Streams of Water full of all manner of wild and tame Fowl, with all &s;orts of Bea&s;ts, Deer of all kinds, Rabbets, Hares, and a &s;ort of Creature named <HI>Buffoli,</HI> which hath no joynts in its fore-legs, and never|thele&s;s runs as &s;wift as any other bea&s;t. In the Parks we had the &s;ight of many Trees and Woods, where the Birds and wild Fowl and Bea&s;ts u&s;e to &s;helter them&s;elves. After this Walk we marched into the Town, all our Company, where the Governor at the entrance received us with his Family; but the Citizens, with the chief men, &s;tood at a di&s;tance, crying out, men, women, and children in their Language, <HI>Marabi, Ma|rabi, Marabi,</HI> that is, Ju&s;tice, Ju&s;tice, Ju|&s;tice. I &s;aw at this &s;udden cry the Gover|nors countenance change: he neverthele&s;s
<PB N="125" REF="141">
drew near to <HI>Sevarminas</HI> with all the re|&s;pect imaginable; but he received him with a &s;etled countenance, and asked what the people meant by their <HI>Marabi.</HI> Before he had time to an&s;wer, one of the chief of the <HI>Sevarites</HI> &s;tept forward, followed by all the re&s;t. They all fell upon their knees, and bowing to <HI>Sevarminas,</HI> they humbly intreated him, that he would li&s;ten to and pity their grievance. What is the matter? an&s;wered he. <Q>One of them &s;tood up, and in the Governors pre&s;ence &s;poke to him in this manner: Mo&s;t Noble and ever Glo|rious Monarch, we your Subjects are heartily glad to &s;ee you among&s;t us, we have longed a great while to have you here to free us from an intolerable burden. Prince <HI>Smuriamnas</HI> our Governor forget|ting the ble&s;&s;ed Rules of our great <HI>Seva|rias,</HI> oppre&s;&s;eth us contrary to all Law and Ju&s;tice, and hath &s;pilled the innocent blood of many of our friends, who&s;e Souls will not &s;uffer us to &s;leep in quiet, till their deaths be revenged. We have often admoni&s;hed him to recal him from his perver&s;e and wicked practices; but to all our admonitions he hath returned no|thing but cur&s;es and blows without mer|cy: &s;o that for the&s;e many years we have

lived as &s;o many &s;laves; and unle&s;s your glorious Maje&s;ty will relieve us, we mu&s;t for&s;ake him and his Principality, and &s;eek our remedy in a retreat far from him. But we expect from your Ju&s;tice and Goodne&s;s that relief which you have af|forded to many of your poor Subjects in &s;uch like ca&s;es.</Q> This Speech made <HI>Smu|riamnas</HI> faint away, &s;o that he fell down as dead before the whole company; but <HI>Se|varminas</HI> cau&s;ed him to be taken up, and his Phy&s;ician to take care of him. <HI>Sevar|minas</HI> expected this complaint before he heard it. His coming was to remove and puni&s;h <HI>Smuriamnas,</HI> and place in his &s;tead his elde&s;t Son <HI>Suricolis,</HI> a young Man of an excellent beauty, who waited upon him from his youth. As &s;oon as he heard the peoples grievance, he a&s;&s;ured them, that he would &s;everely puni&s;h him according to Law, and cau&s;e them to receive &s;atisfacti|on, wi&s;hing them all to depart home with this a&s;&s;urance, without noi&s;e or tumult, and to be ready when his Judges &s;hould be rea|dy to examine their Cau&s;e, to bring in their Allegations and Proofs again&s;t <HI>Smu|riamnas.</HI> In the mean while <HI>Sevarminas</HI> would not go to the Palace of <HI>Smuriamnas</HI> as he was invited, nor to the Town Hall,
<PB N="127" REF="142">
where the Chief of the Town promi&s;ed to bring him a Dinner; but he returned with all his Train to the Ca&s;tle, where Dinner was ready for us. He gave Order, that <HI>Smuriamnas</HI> &s;hould be kept in a clo&s;e Pri|&s;on, joyning to the place of Judicature, till the next day; for then he intended, with the Advice of his Court, to puni&s;h him ac|cording to the Laws of the Land; for it &s;eems he had been guilty of Murder, and Violence, and Oppre&s;&s;ion, and had not ob|&s;erved the &s;acred Laws of the <HI>Sevarites</HI> in his Juri&s;diction. The next day we went down into the Town to accompany <HI>Sevar|minas,</HI> who &s;ate down upon an high Throne prepared for him, under a Canopy of Gold, embroidered; round about &s;ate and &s;tood his religious Coun&s;ellors and Judges. When it was noi&s;ed about the Town, that <HI>Sevar|minas</HI> was &s;ate in his Judgment-&s;eat, for it was not above nine of the clock in the morning, the whole Town came to the place, with intention to accu&s;e <HI>Smuriamnas,</HI> who was brought before the King with his hands tied behind his back. Pre&s;ently there came a Widow with four young Infants weeping, becau&s;e <HI>Smuriamnas</HI> had killed her Husband in his anger, for no other cau&s;e, but becau&s;e he would not comply
<PB N="128" REF="143">
with his irregular commands. She pro|ved it again&s;t him by no le&s;s than ten Wit|ne&s;&s;es, who were there pre&s;ent upon the place. Another &s;tept up and &s;aid, That he had killed his Brother, producing &s;uffi|cient Witne&s;&s;es that &s;aw the Murder. Ano|ther complained of the de&s;troying of his Friend privately: others came forth to de|clare how <HI>Smuriamnas</HI> had oppre&s;&s;ed them with cruel Exactions. The King de&s;ired no other proof of the&s;e Accu&s;ations, but the view of his body without a di&s;gui&s;e, cove|ring, or paint: For, as I &s;aid before, as &s;oon as men among&s;t the <HI>Sevarites</HI> have com|mitted any wickedne&s;s, there is immedi|ately an alteration upon the body and skin of the Offendor, that declares what he hath done. That this might not appear, <HI>Smu|riamnas</HI> had made u&s;e of the Tali&s;manical Art and of Painting, by the one to keep down all tumors and ri&s;ing in his face and hands, and by the other to cover all ugly colours that were upon his skin. There|fore the King commanded him to be &s;tript naked, and carried into a Bath, and there to be rub'd and wa&s;hed, which accord|ingly was done. When he was brought back, I never &s;aw &s;uch a disfigured Crea|ture, his arms were as black as pitch, his
<PB N="129" REF="143">
hands all gore blood, his face as green as gra&s;s, his legs as yellow as &s;affron, on his back and legs appeared two Tumors about the bigne&s;s of Walnuts. When he appear|ed &s;o odious to the company, the King pa&s;&s;ed his Sentence upon him, to the great joy of the Inhabitants: and becau&s;e blood requires blood, and no other Crime is to be puni&s;hed with death but Murder among&s;t the <HI>Sevarites,</HI> the King delivered him to the will of the aggrieved parties to put him to death. They took him fir&s;t and whip|ped him, till his body was full of &s;cars and wounds, which they anointed with honey, and then tyed him upon an high place in the middle of their Town with his face upwards. As &s;oon as he was there, a Swarm of Wa&s;ps and Bees flew about him, with &s;ome Vulturs and Eagles, which devoured him in two days: &s;o that there was no|thing remaining of his body but the bones. The King conde&s;cended to this exemplary puni&s;hment, the rather, becau&s;e <HI>Smuriamnas</HI> had a de&s;ign to alter the Government of the <HI>Sevarites,</HI> and revolt from his obedi|ence: for that purpo&s;e he had endeavou|red to per&s;wade &s;ome other petty Princes to joyn with him again&s;t their Soveraign King <HI>Sevarminas.</HI> Yet he was &s;o gracious
<PB N="130" REF="144">
to call his Son in the prefence of all the Chief men of the Town, and to re&s;tore him to his Fathers E&s;tate and Goods, without the lea&s;t diminution of any thing. He gave him this admonition in the prefence of a multitude of people: <HI>Suricolis,</HI> &s;aid the King, thou ha&s;t &s;een a &s;evere Example of Ju&s;tice upon thy Father for abu&s;ing his Power and Authority, I might make that u&s;e of his Crime, to deprive all his Family from any &s;uch opportunity of doing a mi&s;|chief; but I con&s;ider, that thy Religious inclinations have often cau&s;ed thee to di&s;|allow thy Fathers proceedings, and to blame him for the liberty he took contrary to Ju&s;tice and Law. I con&s;ider, that thou art as likely to do as much good as <HI>Smuri|amnas</HI> hath done mi&s;chief. I re&s;tore thee not only to thy Fathers E&s;tate, but like|wi&s;e to his Authority and Command. Take heed that thou followe&s;t not thy Fathers Example: let not thy Glory puff thee up with pride, nor thy Power cau&s;e thee to act contrary to Rea&s;on and Law: remem|ber that there is a puni&s;hment for evil doers, as there are rewards for the ju&s;t: behave thy &s;elf with that di&s;cretion and moderation, that thou may&s;t have the com|mendation rather than the condemnation
<PB N="131" REF="144">
of thy Country-men, that thou may&s;t de|&s;erve well from me and them. This Cle|mency and Ju&s;tice made <HI>Sevarminas</HI> to be prai&s;ed in all parts among&s;t the <HI>Sevarites;</HI> for thereby all per&s;ons were obliged, and thereby &s;ecured from &s;uch like violences, and the noble Family of <HI>Smuriamnas</HI> con|tinued in its Splendour and Glory, only a rotten Member was taken out of the way for the Publick good.</P>
<P>After this piece of Ju&s;tice, we remained there about a month, which <HI>Sevarminas</HI> &s;pent in regulating all tho&s;e things-that were ami&s;s in the Government of <HI>Smuri|amnas</HI> through his ill Management of Af|fairs. Afterwards he left there the new Governor <HI>Suricolis</HI> to do Ju&s;tice in his ab|&s;ence, commanding him to be impartial in all his publick Actions, and to ab&s;tain from the Vices unto which his Father was inclinable, which ca&s;t him into the dange|rous precipice of de&s;truction.</P>
<P>We departed from thence with the ble&s;|&s;ings and good wi&s;hes of all the Inhabitants, and in three days we returned to <HI>Sevarinde,</HI> where our coming was expected with much impatience; for in the Kings ab&s;ence that City could not be governed well by any other per&s;on. Some di&s;orders therefore had
<PB N="132" REF="145">
happened, which the Viceroy could not pa|cifie without the Kings Authority and Pre|&s;ence. The whole City met us at two miles from the place, and in a mo&s;t beautiful order marched along with us into <HI>Sevarinde.</HI></P>
<P>I continued in the City about half a year, which I &s;pent in inquiring after the Conveniencies of the Country, the Sea-Ports, the Commodities and Riches that it brings forth, that I might give that infor|mation to my Country-men, which might benefit them in future Ages after my re|turn to my own Country; for we were in expectation of a Ship from <HI>Batavia,</HI> whi|ther we had again &s;ent &s;ome of our men with a Ve&s;&s;el, which we had recovered a|mong&s;t the <HI>Sporvi,</HI> to de&s;ire the Governor of <HI>Batavia</HI> to &s;end a Ship that might con|vey away our Goods and per&s;ons.</P>
<P>But whiles I &s;tayed there, a young Lady of <HI>Sevarinde,</HI> who had lo&s;t her Husband by death, fell in love with <HI>Maurice,</HI> and often treated us very nobly in her hou&s;e. <HI>Man+rice</HI> was no <HI>Sevarite,</HI> and could not refrain from &s;ome amorous embrances, which the Lady gladly accepted of; for it was not lawful by the Law of the <HI>Sevarites</HI> to match with any other generation. But to cover their actions, the Lady had made u&s;e of the
<PB N="133" REF="145">
skill of the Philo&s;ophers to keep down the Tumors in her skin and body, and to paint <HI>Maurices</HI> face and hands, which hindered their &s;ecret corre&s;pondency from being known abroad. I mu&s;t needs confe&s;s, that <HI>Maurices</HI> happine&s;s cau&s;ed me to look a|broad, and &s;ee whether I could meet with the &s;ame Fortune: For that purpo&s;e I walk|ed about the City often, early and late, to &s;ee what I &s;hould by chance meet with. About a month before our departure from <HI>Sevarinde,</HI> a young Gentlewoman, who had Father and Mother, and never knew a man, invited me into a Garden, where &s;he was alone, in the Spani&s;h Tongue. I was glad of this opportunity, we walked there|fore &s;everal turns together, talking of di|vers matters: at la&s;t &s;he opened her mind to me in this manner. Sir, I under&s;tand by your countenance, that you are a Stran|ger, our King <HI>Sevarminas</HI> hath a great e&s;teem for you, as well as my Father and Mother: we have often talked of you and your religious behaviour &s;ince your coming into our Country; we &s;hall therefore be glad to be acquainted with you; for in my Fathers name I will bid you welcome, and will a&s;&s;ure you, that he will give you a kind reception; for he is a Merchant, and
<PB N="134" REF="146">
conveys Commodities from City to City among&s;t the <HI>Sevarites.</HI> Sir, mode&s;ty will not give me leave to tell you more of my mind; but when we &s;hall be better ac|quainted, I hope&mdash;With the&s;e words &s;he broke off with a mode&s;t blu&s;h upon her Cheeks. The young Woman was mo&s;t beautiful, and was cloathed in white Silk, with a Girdle of pure Gold, all be&s;et with precious Stones about her middle. She in|quired whether I were not married in my own Country, I a&s;&s;ured her, that I was not: upon this, &s;he confe&s;&s;ed her amorous in|clinations for me, but withal told me, that every thing mu&s;t be performed in due time, and that &s;he would not precipitate the bu|&s;ine&s;s, but wi&s;hed me to ask her Fathers con&s;ent, a&s;&s;uring me, that &s;he would wil|lingly leave all to live and dye with a man of that &s;weet temper and di&s;po&s;ition that I was of. Her loving Complements I an|&s;wered with Care&s;&s;es, and a&s;&s;ured her, that I &s;hould think my &s;elf happy in her injoy|ment. We &s;pent &s;ome time together to begin our acquaintance, and to inform our+&s;elves of one anothers Conditions and E&s;tate; but the night obliged me to leave her for that time, and return to my Lodg|ings. When I gave <HI>Maurice</HI> an account
<PB N="135" REF="146">
of all particulars, he advi&s;ed me not to neglect the offer, but to vi&s;it her in her Fa|thers hou&s;e; for him&s;elf and his Lady, he told me, that he was re&s;olved to carry her with him to <HI>Batavia,</HI> where he intended to live and dye with her: and though Women among&s;t the <HI>Sevarites</HI> are forbidden Goods, and that it is not lawful to tran&s;port them to other Countries, he was per&s;waded by the means of friends with <HI>Sevarminas,</HI> to get that liberty and priviledge, which was never granted to any before. This di&s;|cour&s;e and his hopes made me conceive the &s;ame. I went therefore often to &s;ee the young Lady, who entertained me and my Companions very courteou&s;ly, as well as her Father and Mother. After &s;everal Vi&s;its, I opened the matter to the Parents in their Daughters ab&s;ence; they made &s;ome diffi|culty, becau&s;e of the Laws of the Country, and my inclinations to return into my own Country. But when I told them, that we had Plantations in <HI>Batavia,</HI> not far from thence, and that I would live and dye with her there, they began to yield to my re|que&s;t, in ca&s;e <HI>Sevarminas</HI> would di&s;pen&s;e with the Law of the Land, and &s;uffer me to carry her away. This I told them, that I would endeavour to obtain from his good|ne&s;s.
<PB N="136" REF="147">
I cannot give an exact account of all our plea&s;ant meetings, of the rare things &s;he di&s;covered to me, of the delightful Walks, and other things which pa&s;s all imagination. But certainly her company and &s;weet Conver&s;ation made me &s;pend my time with great contentment. In or|der to our Marriage, when the Portion was agreed upon, I cau&s;ed <HI>Zidi Parabas</HI> and <HI>Ziribabdas,</HI> my two intimate Friends, to open the bu&s;ine&s;s to King <HI>Sevarminas,</HI> that we might have his approbation and con&s;ent to that which was not agreeable with the ancient Laws of the <HI>Sevarites.</HI> But in re|gard we had behaved our &s;elves &s;o religi|ou&s;ly &s;ince our being in the Country, he thought it no di&s;grace to grant us more liberty than ordinary. After this bu&s;ine&s;s had been debated in his Privy Council, it was re&s;olved that this cour&s;e &s;hould be ta|ken to oblige us the more, and invite our Country men to trade with his People. Therefore I had a leave to marry publickly my young Mi&s;tre&s;s, and <HI>Ma&ugrave;rice</HI> al&s;o had a Di&s;pen&s;ation to take to Wife his courteous Lady. When all the&s;e things were agreed upon, the day was appointed, for both King <HI>Sevarminas,</HI> and all the Nobles of his Court, a&s;&s;i&s;ted at the Solemnity, and
<PB N="137" REF="147">
brought us to his Royal Palace, where he be&s;towed upon us mo&s;t rich and glorious Gifts, and entertained our new and young Wives with a &s;umptuous Fea&s;t, at which they had the Honour to &s;it next the Queen. The Ceremony of Marriage was perform|ed in the great Temple of <HI>Sevarinde,</HI> by breaking of bread, and joyning of hands, with many Prayers and Ble&s;&s;ings from their Prie&s;ts. It was concluded with a Dance and Mu&s;ick, where all the young Ladies of the Court &s;hewed their acti|vity.</P>
<P>Before the Marriage was concluded, a Ship was arrived among&s;t the <HI>Sporvi</HI> from <HI>Batavia,</HI> where <HI>Meen Heer van Plumerick</HI> commanded in Chief. As &s;oon as we had news of this Ship, we went and gave an account of its arrival to <HI>Sevarminas,</HI> who de&s;ired us to &s;end for the Captain <HI>Van Plu|merick,</HI> and promi&s;ed, that then we &s;hould have liberty to depart along with him, with our Wives, and &s;uch things as belong|ed to us, to <HI>Batavia,</HI> or whither we had a mind to go. We thanked him for his great and extraordinary Civilities, and told him, that we would &s;pread his Fame all over the World. According to this Order, <HI>Sermodas</HI> was &s;ent back to <HI>Sporunde,</HI>
<PB N="138" REF="148">
to fetch Captain <HI>Van Plumerick,</HI> who&s;e Ship had Orders to get into the River of <HI>Rocara.</HI> He came with &s;ome kind of re|luctancy, not knowing the Civilities and good Entertainment that we had found among&s;t the <HI>Sevarites.</HI> But when he was arrived, and &s;aw the Riches and Happine&s;s of the People and Country, and found them, as well as we, to be men of Faith, good Behaviour, and Hone&s;ty, he was not &s;orry for his conde&s;cen&s;ion to this reque&s;t. After his arrival to <HI>Sevarinde,</HI> we remained there two months, which we &s;pent in mer|ry Sports, Fea&s;ts, Banquets, Hunting, Hawking, and all manner of Delights, ac|cording to the cu&s;tom of that glorious Court. <HI>Sevarminas</HI> was well plea&s;ed with the Conver&s;ation of <HI>Van Plumerick;</HI> for he was a gallant Man, and knew &s;o well how to hit the humor of <HI>Sevarminas,</HI> that the King gave him very rich Pre&s;ents. His Ship had Orders to draw near to the Bor|ders of the <HI>Sevarites</HI> into the River <HI>Rocara,</HI> becau&s;e we might more conveniently load our Goods, and becau&s;e <HI>Sevarminas</HI> had a great de&s;ire to go on board, and &s;ee the manner and fa&s;hions of our Ships of War, and the great Guns that were on board. To comply with his de&s;ire, we all went to
<PB N="139" REF="148">
the banks of the River <HI>Rocara,</HI> where the Ship rode at an Anchor, trimmed and flou|ri&s;hing with Garlands and Pendents of all colours. <HI>Sevarminas,</HI> accompanied by all his Court, was carried in the Captains Pinnace that waited for him, with &s;everal other Boats: when he was aboard, the Cannon and Trumpets bid him welcome. The Captain pre&s;ented him with &s;ome Ra|rities, which they have not in that Country. He gave him a Watch, a Clock, Guns of an extraordinary make, with many other things of <HI>Europe.</HI> After a Banquet in the great Cabin of the Ship, he returned to the &s;hore, very well &s;atisfied with his En|tertainment. He de&s;ired one or two of our great Guns; for he intended to have &s;ome ca&s;t of Silver, becau&s;e he had no Bra&s;s nor Bell-metal in all his Country.</P>
<P>We returned with him to <HI>Sevarinde,</HI> and then taking our farewel of all our Friends and Relations, we carried away our Goods, and &s;hipped them aboard. <HI>Van Plumericks</HI> Ship, with our Wives, and all our Compa|ny, &s;et &s;ail towards <HI>Batavia;</HI> but a &s;torm, or rather a Hurricane at Sea, had a mo&s;t driven us back again on the &s;hore. We e&s;caped narrowly by the great skill of the Mariners, and the watchfulne&s;s and vigi|lancy
<PB REF="149">
of the Captain: &s;o that in &s;ix days, or thereabouts, after the &s;torm, we had &s;ight of a Cape in <HI>Batavia,</HI> where we land|ed, to the great joy of all our Country-men, who were de&s;irous to &s;ee the new Country that we had di&s;covered, when we &s;hewed them our Riches and Jewels, and gave them an account of the excellent People that inhabit there.</P>
