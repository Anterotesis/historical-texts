Greece, and how they departed towards <HI>Con&s;tantinople.</HI></HEAD>
<P>_THere Lived a worthy and re|nowned King in the famous Kingdom
of <HI>France,</HI> called King <HI>Pepin,</HI> who had one on|ly &s;i&s;ter,
who&s;e name was fair <HI>Belli&s;ant;</HI> this beautiful Lady was no le&s;s

<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word">
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="3 letters">ly beloved of all &s;orts
of people: the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2 words"> loved her for
her Clemency, the Gentry loved her for her fidelity, the Com|mons loved her for
her &s;weet behaviour, and the poor loved her for her Charity.</P>
<P>The &s;ame of this gallant Lady re&s;ounded not only through the
Principal Povinces of <HI>France,</HI> but through all the whole world; from
one end to the other; &s;o that to this La|dy came many a Princely Potentate,
hoping to gain her good will in Marriage. Among&s;t the re&s;t of her noble and
renowned Suppli|ants, came the high and mighty Emperour of <HI>Greece,</HI> who
after many daies &s;pent in the Court of <HI>France,</HI> atchieved the
beauteous La|dies love; and with the con&s;ent of her Bro|ther and all the
Nobility, he took her to wife; where a long and &s;pacious time was &s;pent in
fea&s;ting and merriment, to &s;olem|nize the Royal and Nuptial bonds of
Ma|trimony, which were made between the Em|perour and fair
<HI>Belli&s;ant,</HI> Si&s;ter to the King of <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P>But now behold what came to pa&s;s on the &s;udden: There came a
Po&s;t &s;ent from <HI>Con|&s;tantinople,</HI> to certifie the Emperour, that
there was like to be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> great
in&s;urrection and <PB REF="4">combu&s;tion in many of his Provinces, ex|cept
his Highne&s;s would be plea&s;ed to make a &s;peedy return to his own Country,
thereby to pacifie the outrages of the people, and re|new a &s;ettled
peace.</P>
<P>The Emperour and his friends having ta|ken the matter into their
con&s;ideration, how that Divi&s;ions might be a means to rai&s;e mute|nies,
and mutenies to rai&s;e &s;editions, and &s;edi|tions to rai&s;e civil wars,
and that civil wars might bring ruine and de&s;truction, both on him&s;elf and
all his adherents for ever: There|fore he rather chu&s;ing to for&s;ake his
plea&s;ures in <HI>France,</HI> than to endanger the ruine of his own Kingdom,
took leave of his Brother the King of <HI>France,</HI> and the re&s;t of the
Princes and Nobles of his Court; he prepared him|&s;elf with his fair Bride,
for their journey un|to their Court at <HI>Con&s;t&aacute;ntinople.</HI></P>
<P>Their departure cau&s;ed great heavine&s;s at the Court,
in&s;omuch that there was never more &s;orrowful hearts, grieved minds, and
weeping eyes than at that time, for the de|parture of that mode&s;t and well
governed Lady, who with her Lord in &s;hort &s;pace ar|rived at their de&s;ired

<HEAD><HI>Chap. II.</HI> Of the treachery Practi&s;ed by the
Arch-Prie&s;t of <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> again&s;t the fair Empre&s;s
<HI>Belli&s;ant.</HI></HEAD>
<P>NO &s;ooner was the Emperour, and his fair Empre&s;s arrived at
the Port of <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> but they were entertained with as much
joy and Solemnity, as if the Gods them&s;elves had de&s;cended from
<HI>Olym|phus,</HI> to give welcome for tho&s;e long lookt for Gue&s;ts: and
for a congratulation they pre|pared all manner of dainty fare, all manner of
rare Mu&s;ick, and all &s;orts of rich Orna|ments fit for their wearing.</P>
<P>Many Kings, Princes, Lords, and La|dies came from other
Countries, and pre|&s;ented many Rich and co&s;tly Gifts to the royal and
beautiful Empre&s;s, the Lady <HI>Bel|li&s;ant;</HI> and happy were they that
could have &s;o much Favour, as to ki&s;s her Princely hand.</P>
<P>But as <HI>Morpheus</HI> and <HI>Venus</HI> di&s;tracteth and
troubleth Love-&s;ick per&s;ons, whether they &s;leep or wake, &s;o doth
Fortune and en|vy act their parts of cruelty and tyranny <PB REF="5">among&s;t
the chief Monarchs and Princes, as may appear by tho&s;e Golden Pair of
Turtles, the Emperour and his loving Mate. In that Court of great Magnificence
there lived a &s;uppo&s;ed Religious man, who&s;e title was Arch-Prie&s;t, or
Arch-Bi&s;hop: but he proved him&s;elf to be an Arch-Traitor, as you &s;hall
pre&s;ently hear.</P>
<P>This Arch-Prie&s;t was a great Favourite to the Emperour, and
&s;o well thought of in the Emperours Court among the Nobility, that
what&s;oever he &s;aid was a Law: For if there was any one had any bu&s;ine&s;s
with the Emperour, they could not get admittance without the Arch-Prie&s;ts
con&s;ent: Which the Empre&s;s <HI>Belli&s;ant</HI> perceiving, thinking him to
be a ju&s;t and upright man, afforded him the like re&s;pect as others did, and
often|times in &s;ecret would reveal her mind unto him.</P>
<P>Upon a time it came to pa&s;s, they being all alone together, he
being filled with lu&s;t and carnal de&s;ire, bur&s;t forth in the&s;e words
unto her.</P>
<P>Mo&s;t beauteous, fair and comely Lady, I your humble and
devoted Servant, with all the re&s;pects belonging to &s;uch a noble
per&s;o|nage as you are, de&s;ire the grant of one boon <PB REF="6">unto, which
if you perform, I am a liv|ing man, if you deny, you are a dead wo|man.</P>
<P>The Lady hearing him &s;ay &s;o, an&s;wered him in this
manner;</P>
<P>Sir, I am as yet but a &s;tranger in this Empire, but yet will I
afford you any thing that is mine to give, &s;o far forth as rea&s;on doth
require, and that my Princely Husband gives way to.</P>
<P>Then Madam, quoth he, this it is, I de|&s;ire your love,
in&s;omuch that I may embrace the &s;weet and plea&s;ant enjoyments of your
love, and to do with you according to my will.</P>
<P>When the Lady heard him talk; and find|ing him to be lu&s;tful
minded, &s;he &s;pake unto him in this manner.</P>
<P>O thou di&s;&s;embling hypocrite, thou fal&s;e and faithle&s;s
tyrant, thou blood &s;ucking traytor, thou perjured villain, how can&s;t thou
for &s;hame ask &s;uch a que&s;tion of me? Did&s;t thou not once &s;wear to be
true to thy Lord and Ma&s;ter, and wilt thou now go about to ravi&s;h his
e&s;pou&s;ed Wife? Depart from me, and for the fault thou woulde&s;t have
committed ask God forgivene&s;s, and keep thine own coun&s;el, and I will no
fur|ther <PB REF="6">&s;peak of it. When the wicked wretch had received his
denial, he pre&s;ently depart|ed the Room, vowing to be avenged of the Lady:
and &s;o having laid a platform of mi&s;|chief in readine&s;s to work his
de&s;ign, went to the Emperour, and &s;pake unto him in this &s;ort.</P>
<P>O my Noble Lord and Ma&s;ter I that have been all times well
known to your &s;elf your true and faithful &s;ervant, and beloved of all men
for my loyalty to your Highne&s;s, I am now with grief of heart enforced to
reveal a &s;ecret unto you, which is of great concern|ment: and this it is,</P>
<P>The Lady <HI>Belli&s;ant</HI> your wife, which you thought to be
&s;o vertuous, cha&s;t, and hone&s;t, is known and found to be otherwi&s;e; For
why, &s;he hath con&s;pired your Death, acted Trea&s;on again&s;t your
per&s;on, and the Child which is now in her Womb is of another mans begetting:
and therefore Noble Sir, I think there is no better cour&s;e to be taken, than
to &s;end her away to <HI>France,</HI> from whence &s;he came, and that
&s;uddenly and privily, that the world may not take notice of what is done.</P>
<P>When the Emperour had heard this &s;trange Relation from the
fal&s;e di&s;&s;embling <PB REF="7">Arch-traitor, his wrath was &s;o much
infla|med, that he had neither the Patience nor power to forbear, but
pre&s;ently ran into the Room where his harmle&s;s Lady was &s;itting all alone
in her &s;olitary dumps: So taking his advantage, ran &s;treightwaies unto her,
and taking hold of her hair, pulled her to the ground, beat her on the face
with his Fi&s;ts, and &s;tampt upon her with his feet, in&s;omuch that the
blood i&s;&s;ued out from her No&s;e and mouth &s;o violently, that the like
was hardly ever &s;een.</P>
<P>But at la&s;t, when he had tired him&s;elf with abu&s;ing this
Lady, he &s;tood panting for breath, thinking to have gone to her again.</P>
<P>Mean while &s;he was recovered upon her knees; and as &s;he was
kneeling, &s;he &s;pake to him &s;aying,</P>
<P>O my dear Lord, what is the rea&s;on that without cau&s;e you
deal thus cruelly with me? I de&s;ire you, my good Lord, to &s;pare me my life;
if not for my own &s;ake, yet let it be done for the Infants &s;ake which is
yet unborn.</P>
<P>Well quoth the Emperour, I will &s;pare thee thy Life, but this
&s;hall be thy doom, that thou &s;halt for ever be bani&s;hed from my
pre|&s;ence, <PB REF="7">and be &s;ent to thy brother in <HI>France;</HI> with
a writing upon thy bre&s;t, for all that look on thee to read, how that for thy
di&s;loy|alty to thy Husband, for thy Treacherous plots devi&s;ed, and for the
acting the part of a Strumpet, thou art bani&s;hed the Royal Court of
<HI>Con&s;tantinople;</HI> and therefore pre|pare thy &s;elf to night to be
gone to morrow, for here is no longer time for you to abide.</P>

<HEAD><HI>Chap. III.</HI> How the Empre&s;s <HI>Belli&s;ant,</HI>

&s;trange births of <HI>Valentine</HI> and <HI>Or&s;on.</HI></HEAD>
<P>NOW when morning was come, the di|&s;tre&s;&s;ed Lady
<HI>Belli&s;ant</HI> was &s;et on hor&s;e|back, according to the Emperours
command, having no other company to go along with her, but one man which was
her &s;ervant, and came out of <HI>France</HI> with her. Now mark what happened
to them in their journey: for the Proverb &s;aith that one Swallow doth not
make a Summer, neither doth one mi&s;ery go by it &s;elf.</P>
<P>As they were pa&s;&s;ing through a huge and &s;pacious

could po&s;&s;ibly do, but before he returned back again the Lady was delivered
of two Sons, of which an ugly &s;he-Bear coming along, <PB REF="8">caught one
of them up, and ran away with

D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">n, to be a prey

pur&s;ued the bear to recover her &s;on, but in vain, &s;he be|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ng al&s;o &s;o weak, that &s;he

him to nur&s;e, calling his name <HI>Valentine;</HI> Of whom you &s;hall hear
more hereafter, in the &s;ub&s;equent di&s;cour&s;e of his Hi&s;tory.</P>
<P>The Bear (as by providence it came to pa&s;s) never devoured the
child that &s;he car|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ied to

<HEAD><HI>Chap. IV.</HI> How <HI>Valentine</HI> conquered
<HI>Or&s;on,</HI> and brought him to the Royal Court of his &V;ncle King

<P>THis <HI>Valentine</HI> was of &s;uch a Noble and heroick
courage, and gallant behaviour, that he was known to be the chiefe&s;t and
able&s;t man at Arms that was in all the noted Court of <HI>France,</HI> and
would encounter any man that came to oppo&s;e him.</P>
<P>This <HI>Valentine</HI> hearing the &s;trange reports of
<HI>Or&s;on,</HI> how he overcame and conquer|ed all that ever came near him,
re&s;olved on a time to try his valour, courage and magna|nimity, and venture
his life with the wild man <HI>Or&s;on,</HI> not thinking he had been his
brother.</P>
<P>And thus being couragiou&s;ly mounted on hor&s;eback, (rich and
gallantly clad in Armour bright, with a mo&s;t excellent &s;word by his &s;ide)
he rode to the &s;pacious Fore&s;t, to find out the wild man, which he quickly
did; and upon his near and &s;udden approach, he found him prepared for the
Combate, and rea|dy to encounter him; for indeed <HI>Or&s;on</HI> ne|ver 
<PB REF="10">went unprovided of his great Weapon, which was a mighty Club, made
of an Oa|ken tree: with which at the fir&s;t &s;alute he gave
<HI>Valentines</HI> Hor&s;e &s;uch a bang on the No&s;e; that he beat out his
brains; and then was <HI>Valentine</HI> bound to fight for his life, for to fly
it was in vain.</P>
<P>Thus was the Combate with great courage renewed, and
<HI>Valentine</HI> with his &s;word and <HI>Or&s;on</HI> with his Club fought
along time, and drew much blood of one another: But at the la&s;t
<HI>Valentine</HI> through skill and policy van|qui&s;hed <HI>Or&s;on,</HI> who
was far more &s;tronger than him&s;elf: and having obtained an ab&s;o|lute
conque&s;t, immediately after brought him bound to the King of <HI>France,</HI>

Duke enter|tained them as befitted &s;uch Royal per&s;ona|ges, declaring all
the deeds which the Green Knight had done, and the conque&s;ts he had made.</P>
<P><HI>Valentine</HI> hearing this, determined to try the might of
this Champion: So arming him&s;elf, he rode to his Tent. The Green Knight
&s;eeing him, pre&s;ently mounted his &s;teed, and between them began a mo&s;t
cruel Combate, both giving and receiving many wounds; at length the Green
Knight &s;aid, Knight, thy valour cau&s;eth me to pity thee, therefore I

<HI>Valentine</HI> continued the fight till night parted them, and both betook

<P><HI>Valentine</HI> con&s;idering the Green Knights words, and
that him&s;elf had &s;uckt the brea&s;ts of a woman, determined to &s;end

<P><HI>Or&s;on</HI> &s;eeing this, thought it in vain to u&s;e his

his face towards the Hor&s;e tail, then to be &s;et three daies with his
<HI>Ears fa&s;t nailed to the Pillory and then his body to be taken and thrown
into a Cauldron of boyling Lead,</HI> which was a ju&s;t reward for a

that ever <HI>Chri&s;tendom</HI> afforded: They conquered Gyants, &s;ubdued

renowned battels again&s;t the Enemies of <HI>Chri&s;tendom,</HI> in&s;omuch
