<P>The inward circle is diuided into 360 degrees, giuing vnto each Signe 30 de|grees, the &s;emidiameter of the twelue mo|neths is &s;uppo&s;ed to be diuided into 60 parts, from w^c^h center is &s;uppo&s;ed another center to be 2 degrees 9 minutes of the &s;aid 60 parts, according to <HI>Ticho Brache,</HI> who maketh the place or point of the Sunnes <HI>Apogeum,</HI> to be in the 6 degree of Cancer, in this age of the world. The <HI>Apogeum</HI> of the Sunne is that point in which when the Sunne commeth vnto he is in his &s;lowe&s;t mo|tion, or furthe&s;t di&s;tant from the Earth, that is to &s;ay, Iune 17. then the Sunne &s;hall be in the &s;ixt degree of Cancer, the <HI>Peregeum</HI> of the Sunne &s;hall be when he commeth into the &s;ixt degree of Capricorne, being oppo&s;ite to the &s;ixt degree of Cancer. The &s;econd mouable part is diuided into 29 dayes and one halfe, which doth &s;hew the age of the Moone. The next Circle is di|uided into 24 houres, and each houre into 4 quarters, each quar|ter into 3 parts, each part being 5 minutes.</P>

<DIV3 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>The manner of the Moones Eclip&s;e.</HEAD>
<P>THe word Eclip&s;e is as much to &s;ay as To want light, and to be darkned, or hidden from our &s;ight.</P>
<P>The Moones Eclip&s;e is figured at the foot of <HI>America,</HI> ouer again&s;t your left hand, which is thus: <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<PB REF="4" MS="y">
<P>When the Sun and Moone are oppo&s;ite one to the other dia|metrally, and the Earth in the very mid&s;t betweene both: that is, when a right line drawne from the center of the Sun to the cen|ter of the Moone, pa&s;&s;eth through the center of the Earth: For the body of the earth being thicke and not tran&s;parent, ca&s;ting his &s;hadow to that point which is oppo&s;ite to the place of the Sun, will not &s;uffer the Moon to receiue any light from the Sun, from whom &s;he alwayes borroweth her light. And note, that euery time &s;he is at the full, &s;hee is oppo&s;ite to the Sun, and yet the Earth is not at euery &s;uch full diametrally betwixt her and the Sun, for then &s;he &s;hould be eclip&s;ed at euery full, which indeed cannot be, vnle&s;s &s;he be either in the head or taile of the Dragon.</P>
<P>Now the Moone is eclip&s;ed in part, when the Sun, the Earth, and the Moone, be met in one &s;elfe diametrall line, but the Moon is declining either on the one &s;ide or on the other.</P>
<P>But note that eclip&s;es of the Moone may be vniuer&s;all, becau&s;e the Earth is far bigger then the Moone, and thereby able to &s;ha|dow her whole body.</P>

<P>THe Eclip&s;e of the Sun is &s;hewed by that Figure at the foot of <HI>A&s;ia,</HI> again&s;t your right hand, and happeneth</P>
<P>When the Moone is betwixt the Sun and the Earth, which chanceth in a Coniunction or new of the Moone: and yet not in euery Coniunction, but when it falleth either in the head or taile of the Dragon: which may chance (as is &s;aid before) either totally, or in part: totally, in re&s;pect of tho&s;e parts of the Earth whereon the &s;hadow directly falleth. For &s;ith the Moone is farre le&s;&s;er then the Earth, &s;he cannot &s;hadow all the Earth, and there|fore the eclip&s;e of the Sun cannot be vniuer&s;all: but yet to &s;ome parts of the earth it may be totally, to &s;ome partly, and to others nothing at all; as may appeare by the afore&s;aid Figure.</P>

<P>There are al&s;o many Meridians according to the diuer&s;e place in which a man liues, the number of them equall to &s;o many points as may bee imagined in the Globe; but the v&s;uall &s;etting them downe to view, is by ten degrees a&s;under; and are tho&s;e blacke lines which you &s;ee in both Plani&s;pheares, running down along from the North to the South Pole.</P>
<P>The v&s;e of the Meridian, is to &s;hew the longitude of any place. Now the longitude of a Region, City, or Cape, is the di|&s;tance of it Ea&s;t from the fir&s;t great Meridian; and this longitude is mea&s;ured and numbred in the Aequinoctiall line by Meridians from the generall and fixed Meridian, into the Ea&s;t, and contai|neth the whole compa&s;&s;e of the earth, viz. 360. degrees.</P>
<P>To proue this by example, ca&s;t your eye on London, and you &s;hall &s;ee it &s;omething to the Ea&s;t of the &s;econd blacke Meridian; pa&s;&s;e downe with that blacke line to the Aequinoctiall, and look as much Ea&s;t there, as London is from that Meridian aboue, then count the degrees of the Aequinoctiall from the fir&s;t great Meri|dian to that place, and that di&s;tance is the longitude of London; which you may perceiue to be 20. degrees and better. And the like manner of working is to be made for all other places.</P>
<P>That <HI>line</HI> full of degrees, cro&s;&s;ing both Plani&s;pheares &s;traight along in the middle, and diuiding the world into two halfs <HI>(viz.)</HI> North and South halfes, is called the <HI>Aequinoctiall line,</HI> or the Aequator; either becau&s;e it is of equall di&s;tance from both Poles of the world, or el&s;e becau&s;e the Sunne comming in this Circle makes the dayes and nights throughout the world of like length; which happens vpon the 10. or 11. of March, and the 13. or 14. of September. It pa&s;&s;es through Aba&s;&s;ia or <HI>Pre&s;tor Iohns</HI> King|dome, and Mani Congo in Africa, through the great Iland Su|matra, and the Maldiue Iles of A&s;ia; and in America, through Guiana.</P>
<P>The v&s;e of it is to &s;hew the Latitude of any Country, Citie, Promontory, or the like: Now the Latitude is the di&s;tance of a place toward the South or North, from the Aequinoctiall line or middle of the world, and is reckoned and mea&s;ured vpon the Meridian toward either Pole: tho&s;e therefore haue Northerne latitude that inhabit betweene the Aequinoctiall and the North Pole, as they haue Southerne latitude that are betweene the &s;ame Aequator and the South Pole.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e <HI>blacke lines</HI> thwarting the blacke Meridians from Ea&s;t to We&s;t, are parallels, &amp; are al&s;o called Aequidi&s;tants, being di&s;tant one from another 10. degrees toward both Poles; and are here &s;et downe for the ea&s;ier counting the latitude of any place from the Aequinoctiall: as for the <HI>latitude</HI> of London; count &s;o many decimall parallels till you come to the parallel which is neere&s;t London, (you &s;hall finde them to be fiue) then follow that line to the Meridian, and &s;ee the figures &s;et thereat; (they are 50.) moreouer adde to that number of 50. &s;o much as London is &s;itu|ate aboue that parallel, the &s;pace is one degree and a halfe; thus &s;hall you finde the latitude of London, (that is, the di&s;tance thereof from the Aequator toward the North Pole) to be 51. de|grees and a halfe: and in like manner mu&s;t the Latitude of all other places be &s;ought. Thus much of Longitude and Latitude, by which two the whole Earth is reckoned.</P>
<P>The Meridian and Aequinoctiall, as al&s;o the Zodiacke, are fil|led throughout with degrees, the number 360. and euery degree con&s;i&s;ts of 60. Minutes, and containes, according to our ordinary account, 20. leagues, or three&s;core miles.</P>
<P>The <HI>great circle</HI> that is drawne bending bias in the one plani|&s;pheare vp to the Tropicke of Cancer, in the other downe to the Tropicke of Capricorne, is the <HI>Zodiacke;</HI> it is repleni&s;hed with degrees, and bears on it the characters of the 12. &s;ignes.</P>
<P>The v&s;es of it are to &s;hew ouer what Countries and people the body and beames of the Sunne come perpendicular at &s;ome times or other in the yeare: and it &s;hewes to all (where the dayes increa&s;e and decrea&s;e) the longe&s;t and &s;horte&s;t daies of the yeare: for the Sunne (which cau&s;eth the &s;ame) being alwaies in this circle, and therein mouing, about one degree a day, all the while he is comming vp from the Tropicke of Capricorne to that of Cancer, the dayes increa&s;e in the Northerne Climats; but con|trariwi&s;e in his cour&s;e backe from Cancer to Capricorne, they &s;horten to vs, and lengthen to tho&s;e in the Southerne Climates: and this Circle &s;hewes the foure quarters of the yeare, Spring, Summer, Autumne, Winter.</P>
<P>The <HI>Tropicke of Cancer,</HI> (&s;o called of the coele&s;tiall &s;igne Can|cer) is a circle, who&s;e di&s;tance from the Aequinoctiall toward the North, is 23. degrees and a halfe. When the Sunne is come &s;o farre Northward as to touch this circle, then is our longe&s;t day in the yeare.</P>
<P>It pa&s;&s;es through the Southermo&s;t parts of Barbary and Ae|gypt, Arabia, India, China, <HI>Noua Hi&s;pania,</HI> and the Iland Cuba.</P>
<P>The <HI>Tropicke of Capricorne,</HI> (likewi&s;e &s;o named of the &s;igne Ca|pricorne in the &s;tarry heauen) is a circle of like di&s;tance as the other Tropicke from the Aequinoctiall Southward, that is, 23. degrees and a halfe. When the Sunne is gone downe to this circle Southward, it is our &s;horte&s;t day in the whole yeare.</P>
<P>This Tropicke pa&s;&s;es through Monomotapa, Saint <HI>Laurence</HI> Iland, Peru, and the South coa&s;ts of Bra&s;ile.</P>
<P>The <HI>Articke,</HI> or North polar circle, is di&s;tant from the North Pole 23. degrees and a halfe; &s;o much as the Tropicke of Cancer is from the Aequinoctiall: but the di&s;tance betweene that Tro|picke and it, is 43. degrees.</P>

<P>Now the&s;e foure le&s;&s;er circles, <HI>(viz.)</HI> the two Tropickes, and Polar circles, doe fitly part the earth into fiue Zones.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>The Zones.</HEAD>
<P>A <HI>Zone</HI> is a &s;pace of earth, contained betweene two of the &s;maller circles, or within the compa&s;&s;e of either polar circle: the name &s;ignifies as much as a girdle, by rea&s;on that each Zone compa&s;&s;eth about the earth in manner of a girdle. Of the&s;e there be two kinds: one temperate, the other vntemperate.</P>
<P>There bee two temperate Zones, the one North, the other South.</P>
<P>The <HI>North temperate Zone</HI> is that &s;pace of earth contained be|tweene the Tropicke of Cancer, and the North polar circle.</P>
<P>The <HI>South temperate Zone</HI> is that &s;pace of earth &s;tretched along betweene the Tropicke of Capricorne, and the South po|lar circle.</P>
<P>They are called temperate Zones for that the ayre thereof hath a far better and more moderate temperature, and meeter for man to inhabit, then the vntemperate Zones. The breadth of them is 43, degrees apiece, which degrees make either temperate Zone to be 2580. Engli&s;h miles broad apiece.</P>
<P>The <HI>vntemperate Zones</HI> are twofold: one exceeding in the extre|mity of heat, the other as much in cold: they haue beene thought in former times altogether vnhabitable, but later experience hath found them more fit for habitation.</P>
<P>The <HI>Torrid or burnt Zone</HI> (which is the hot vntemperate Zone) is that &s;pace of heauen which you &s;ee contained betweene the Tropicke of Cancer, and that of Capricorne. It hath the name of <HI>Torrid,</HI> becau&s;e the Sunne continually pa&s;&s;es thereouer, and ca|&s;ting downe direct rayes, affects it with a maruellous heat, there|by making it not &s;o conuenient for the inhabitants, as the tempe|rate Zones are. The breadth of this Zone is comprehended be|tweene the two Tropickes, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="4 letters">aines 47. degrees, that is of Engli&s;h miles 2820.</P>
<P>The <HI>frozen Zones</HI> are &s;pace of earth inclo&s;ed within either of the Polar circles: of the&s;e th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="2 letters">e are two, one North, the other South.</P>
<P>The <HI>North frozen Zone</HI> is that &s;pace of earth contained within the compa&s;&s;e of the North polar circle. The breadth thereof is reckoned 23. degrees and a halfe, <HI>(viz.)</HI> from the Pole it &s;elfe to the polar circle: which of Engli&s;h miles is 1410.</P>
<P>The <HI>South frozen Zone,</HI> is that &s;pace of earth compa&s;&s;ed all about with the South polar circle: It hath the like breadth from the South pole, as the other frozen Zone hath from the North pole; and likewi&s;e the number of miles is the &s;ame.</P>
<P>They are called <HI>Frozen Zones,</HI> becau&s;e they (for the mo&s;t part) exceed in cold: and that is cau&s;ed in regard that the Sunne, for a good part of the yeare, is vnder the Horizon, and &s;ees them not: and when he is come vp into their &s;ight, his appearance (which is for a pretty long &s;ea&s;on together) rather comforts them, then any virtuall heart proceeding from him; for there the Ayre is &s;tuft with thicke foggy vapours, and his beames at highe&s;t fall but very oblikely on them: &s;o that what through his want and vnability to di&s;pell the cold, and the colds force to re&s;i&s;t and beat backe the Sunnes heat, the&s;e Zones remaine almo&s;t vnhabitable, and euen (as the word is) frozen.</P>
<P>The names of all the&s;e, &s;et in the right place of each Zone, you &s;hall &s;ee in that Meridian going about America and Magellanica.</P>

<HEAD>Of the Climats.</HEAD>
<P>IN that <HI>great Meridian</HI> going about Europe, A&s;ia, and Africa, are de&s;cribed the <HI>Climates:</HI> Now a <HI>Climat</HI> is a &s;pace of the Earth included within the &s;pace of two Parallels. The v&s;e of them is to &s;hew the difference of length and &s;hortne&s;&s;e of dayes ouer all the world, as you may &s;ee in the mid&s;t of euery Climat &s;et the number of the houres of the longe&s;t day in the yeare, vn|der that Climat: the longe&s;t day in one Climat differing halfe an houre from the longe&s;t in another. So that there are foure and twenty Climes, con&s;i&s;ting of forty eight Parallels, ere the day come to be 24. houres in length, which is twelue houres longer then the ordinary Aequinoctiall day is. Now this is to be vnder|&s;tood; Vnder the Aequinoctiall line, and 13. degrees, that is 3. Parallels, on either &s;ide thereof, the dayes exceed not the length of twelue houres, but after in euery Clime increa&s;e the length of halfe an houre, &s;o that there are numbred (as is &s;aid before) 48. Parallels, which make 24. Climats, before the dayes become 24. houres long: the which length they being growne to, their in|crea&s;e is then by whole weekes and moneths, till in the foure and twentieth Clime, about the Pole, the day is full halfe a yeare long. And as it is thus betweene the Aequator and North Pole, &s;o is it betweene the &s;aid Aequator and the South Pole: wherefore there are two &s;orts of Climats, that is, 24. Northerne, and as many Southerne. The Climes Northward are thus named: the fir&s;t is <HI>Dia Meroes,</HI> becau&s;e the middle parallell thereof pa&s;&s;es through the midde&s;t of the Inland Iland Meroe, in the Conti|nent of Africa; the &s;econd is <HI>Dia Sienes,</HI> the third <HI>Dia Alexan|drias,</HI> the fourth <HI>Dia Rhodos,</HI> the fift <HI>Dia Romes,</HI> the &s;ixt <HI>Dia Ponton,</HI> the &s;euenth <HI>Dia Bori&s;thenes,</HI> the eight <HI>Dia Ripheos,</HI> the ninth <HI>Per Daniam.</HI> The South Climes haue the &s;ame names, &s;aue onely that the word <HI>Antuis</HI> thereto added; as <HI>Anti-Dia Me|roes;</HI> the next, <HI>Anti-Dia Sienes,</HI> and &s;o along vnto the ninth Southward: further then the ninth Clime on either &s;ide the Ae|quinoctiall they are not named; but yet the Climes runne on both wayes to the number of 24. as is &s;eene in the Meridian. That there be but nine named, the rea&s;on is, becau&s;e when the&s;e names were giuen, no more then nine Climats were knowne to tho&s;e of ancient times; but &s;ince, though the number of them be increa&s;t to 24. the re&s;t are not &s;o knowne by proper names, but remaine innominate.</P>
