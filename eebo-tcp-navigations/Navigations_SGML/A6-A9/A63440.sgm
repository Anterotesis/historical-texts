<HEAD>A true and perfect Relation of the Apprehen&s;ion of five Fryers, one Pilgrim, and three Souldiers, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P>NOt to trouble my Reader with any tedi|ous preamble to little or no purpo&s;e, but to come readily and truly to the matter in hand, which being &s;uch an extraordi|nary pa&s;&s;age, of Gods good providence towards this Land and Nation; in pre&s;erving us from the daily Plots and wicked machinations of his and our adver&s;aries. It is not fit it &s;hould lye al together &s;mother'd up in the pit of oblivion; but be divulg'd and &s;pread abroad in each cor|ner of this Kingdome, that &s;o all true hearted Prote&s;tants may know, and knowing, may un|der&s;tand how infinitely they are ingaged to ble&s;&s;e God for &s;uch wonderfull deliverances, and with <HI>David</HI> extoll his Name, from one ge|neration to another.</P>
<P>It were needle&s;&s;e to &s;tand upon particulars in a poynt &s;o plaine and obvious to the eye of every faithfull Prote&s;tant.</P>
<P>If you aske who's our adver&s;aries, the que&s;ti|on
<PB REF="3">is &s;oone an&s;wered, who? But the Je&s;uites, Fryers, Papi&s;ts Prie&s;ts, and others of the wicked adherents to the &s;ect of <HI>Rome.</HI></P>
<P>If you aske how this is manife&s;ted, daily ex|perience proves it; how many helli&s;h Plots and Con&s;piracies hath this infernall tribe hatcht a|gain&s;t the&s;e his Maje&s;ties Kingdomes of <HI>England, Scotland,</HI> and <HI>Ireland,</HI> &s;ince the beginning of re|formation? When the Illu&s;trious &s;plendor of the Go&s;pell fir&s;t began to &s;hine in our Britti&s;h Horizon to this pre&s;ent, poore afflicted <HI>Ireland</HI> can &s;adly witne&s;&s;e the truth hereof, who&s;e de|plorable condition at this time, by the cruell inhumanity and barbarous actions of the blood thir&s;ty Papi&s;ts, again&s;t the faithfull Profe&s;&s;ors of the Prote&s;tant Religion in that Kingdome, would extract teares from a heart of flint, to heare that &s;uch tygers &s;hould be coucht under the &s;hapes of men, but the particulars of this their tyranny, is well knowne to all men.</P>
<P>I &s;hall not therefore in&s;i&s;t upon that or any other di&s;cour&s;e, but come briefely to this la&s;t project, hatch by their grand-father the Devill, ble&s;t by their holy father the Pope, put in pra|ctice by his children, the Fryars and Je&s;uites; but di&s;covered by God, who&s;e never &s;lumbring eye continually &s;ees, and &s;eeing, derides all &s;uch fooli&s;h combinations again&s;t his Church and people, and now brought to light, that all true Chri&s;tians and &s;ubjects may bee thank|full
<PB REF="3">for the &s;ame, and prai&s;e the great Name of the Lord for ever and ever.</P>
<P>In March la&s;t 1642, a certaine &s;hip under the conduct of <HI>Patrick Sym<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">t</HI> who was Ma&s;ter thereof, &s;hould have tran&s;ported it into <HI>Ireland,</HI> with the&s;e pa&s;&s;engers, who&s;e names are as fol|loweth, <HI>Thomas Fa&s;tell, Teage Barr, Patrick Carr, Richard Birke, Francis Cauthon,</HI> Fryars; <HI>Malathyn Gaggon</HI> Pilgrim; <HI>Thomas Moham, Bryant Mackall Greahall, Daniel Brianon</HI> Souldiers.</P>
<P>This goodly company being minded to vi&s;it their traitorous Confederates in <HI>Ireland,</HI> upon what enterpri&s;e is not yet knowne, untill the wi&s;edome of the Parliament &s;hall further exa|mine the bu&s;ine&s;&s;e; but being greatly &s;u&s;pected, and not without good cau&s;e, both &s;hippe and pa&s;&s;engers were &s;tayd in their journey at Saint <HI>Ives</HI> in <HI>Cornwall,</HI> by the Vice-Adm&icirc;rall <HI>M.
