<HEAD>THE Trecherous Plot of Confederacie in <HI>Ireland.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THe Rebels have done much harme in the Country of <HI>Calway,</HI> in the province of <HI>Conog</HI> where they &s;pare no cruelty to any Sex, e&s;tate or degree what&s;oever, and that even upon the Lords day: on which day if they are not &s;hedding of bloud, they have meetings of playes, gaming, pa&s;times, bag|pipes, drinking, and abominable venery, and wanton|ne&s;&s;e in every place where they come.</P>
<P>Vpon St. <HI>Andrewes</HI> day la&s;t, being the 30 of <HI>Nov.</HI> 1641. there pitched about the number of 300 Rebels in armes neare <HI>Logreags,</HI> and <HI>Artaure,</HI> who marched with Spani&s;h Cullors, and Armes in their Antient, and 100 more pitched neare <HI>Temenage,</HI> who hovered up and downe about the woods and villages therea|bouts, &s;eeking an opportunity to worke their wicked de&s;ignes.</P>
<P>Their intent was (as it was conceived) to march to <HI>&V;ort Omnie</HI> to &s;urprize the Earle of <HI>Clanrickards</HI> hou&s;e, and to take away, and overthrow his forces; which con&s;i&s;t of an hundred hor&s;e, and as many foot, which is the be&s;t &s;trength thereabouts: but it &s;eems that their intent was as well to &s;urprize the Ca&s;tle of <HI>Logrags,</HI> and the Fort of <HI>Callway</HI> al&s;o, as well as the forces of the &s;aid Earle, but they were preverted at that time.</P>
<P><PB REF="3">The &s;aid Ca&s;tle of <HI>Logerage,</HI> and the Fort of <HI>Calway</HI> were in great danger to have beene betrayed into the hands of the Rebels, by &s;ome popi&s;h &s;ouldiers, with certaine popi&s;hly affected Gentlemen and Marchants that were inhabitants there.</P>
<P>They con&s;pired a plot with the <HI>Rebels,</HI> in which plot they intended a bloudy de&s;ign in cruell manner, again&s;t the Ca&s;tle, Fort, and townes thereabout, wher|in had they accompli&s;hed their de&s;ignes, they would, as it is ju&s;tly feared, bin as cruell to the Prote&s;tants there, as they are in other places thereabouts.</P>
<P>To contrive this Plot covertly and &s;uttlely not to be taken notice of, they had contrived a way to &s;treng|then them&s;elves with Ammunition from <HI>France,</HI> for there were there enhabiting certain Marchants, who&s;e &s;hips were come from thence laden with &s;alt: The comming of which &s;hips, as it doth appeare, were an <HI>Item</HI> to the <HI>Rebels,</HI> to give them notice of the time, which cau&s;ed them then to march into tho&s;e parts, as it is conceived. The&s;e &s;hips being laden with &s;alt, were pre&s;ently gone about to be unladed, to which Office, were picked out by the Marchants, &s;uch who they thought fitte&s;t for that &s;ecrecie: yet were there di&s;cerned by the Officers, to bee brought from the &s;hips, muskets and &s;words: which being di&s;covered to the Prote&s;tans there, the matter was further &s;ought into, and it was found, that there were brought over from <HI>France,</HI> buryed in the &s;alt, be&s;ide the &s;aid mu&s;|kets and &s;words, divers other Ammunition for war; brought over, as is conceived, for to &s;trengthen the <HI>Rebels</HI> again&s;t the <HI>Prote&s;tants,</HI> or at lea&s;t the Papi&s;ts thereabout to a&s;&s;i&s;t them in the betraying up of tho&s;e
<PB REF="3">
places into their hands by the &s;aid forces, by which meanes, both the Fort and Ca&s;tle, and all places thereabouts were in great danger.</P>
<P>About this time, the &s;hips being well nigh unla-which was about St. <HI>Andrews</HI> day, as before, the rebels marched about the&s;e places, where they began to in|&s;ult and fall upon the people, putting many to the &s;word, &s;o the Prote&s;tants at <HI>Callway,</HI> &amp; therabouts, &s;ea|zed on the Ammunition, and &s;trengthned them&s;elvs: whereby they fell upon the <HI>Rebels,</HI> and there was a great battell fought between them, which wrought a great feare to all people thereabouts: but there came in good ayd to the Prote&s;tant &s;ide; &s;o that in that fight they received not much hurt, onely &s;omewoun|ded. But of the Iri&s;h rebels there were taken twenty, which were &s;ent to the States to be cen&s;ured, and a|bove an hundred &s;laine, and wounded &s;o &s;ore, that they are not likely to live, and the re&s;t returned backe againe, and fled for their lives to another part of the running Campe.</P>
<P>The next day they returned againe with a greater Force, but marched two or three miles from <HI>Logrags</HI> on the other &s;ide toward the Earle of <HI>Clanrickards</HI> againe, again&s;t whom they have long con&s;pired, and they marched &s;o furiou&s;ly in the night, that they were come to the &s;aid Earle of <HI>Clan|rickards</HI> before they were taken notice of, or their returne known: &s;o that in the morning ere they were aware, the houfe was be&s;et with the Rebels, who began to pull downe the walls, and di&s;charged again&s;t the hou&s;e, which they could not come neare, becau&s;e the wall is &s;o large about the hou&s;e, &s;o the forces of the Earle prepared them&s;elves, &amp; came forth again&s;t them; but the Rebels being too &s;trong for them, &s;lew about 30 of their company in a &s;hort &s;pace, and di&s;comfitted the Lord and his company exceedingly, &s;o that they were all in great feare.</P>
<P><PB REF="4">But it plea&s;ed God to &s;end them up reliefe from the town, &amp; &s;ome other <HI>Prote&s;tants</HI> that came in from other places thereabouts to relieve them, whereby the Rebels were &s;o be&s;et on a &s;udden, that they were faine to flye, and take the woods.</P>
