<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THe reducing of the Wild Scots, we fear will prove a work of great diffi|culty; for many of them are brake forth in|to new di&s;tempers and Rebellion, being headed by the Clans and Mac-Donals; and on the 12 of this in&s;tant Feb. advanced as far as Innerne&s;s, where they fell upon the Parliaments forces, and put almo&s;t all to the &s;word that they met withall. However, we have &s;ince pretty well paid them home; for on the 14 in&s;tant a party of Col. Okey's Dragoons met with them neer Chivy-cha&s;e
<PB N="4" REF="3">where they hunted them hand&s;omely, killed about one hundred, and took about two hundred pri&s;o|ners. Yet notwith&s;tanding, they declare high for their King; but we doubt not, but (in proce&s;s of time) to bring them low for the Parliament of the Common-wealth of England. And upon the&s;e prin|ciples, we may pre&s;ume to build our foundation, viz. For whereas the Commoners of England in this Age of the world are ri&s;en up in an Army, and have ca&s;t out that Inva&s;ion of the duke of Normandy, and have won their Land and Liberties again by the Sword, if they do not &s;uffer their Councels to be|fool them into &s;lavery again upon a new accompt. For if &s;o be that Kingly Authority be &s;et up in your Laws again, King CHARLES hath conquered you and your Po&s;terity by policy, and won the field of you, though you have &s;eemingly cout off his head. for the &s;trength of a King lies not in the vi&s;ible ap|pearance of his body, but in his Will, Laws, and Au|thority. But if you remove Kingly Government, and &s;et up true and free Common-wealths Govern|ment, then you gain your Crown, and keep it, and leave peace to your Po&s;terity.</P>

<P>SInce the clo&s;e of this Letter, we have received an Ab&s;tract, or Narrative, of the Tran&s;action of Affairs in France; a breviate whereof take as fol|loweth:</P>

<HEAD>A Declaration for Freedom.</HEAD>
<P>Whereas if an Army be rai&s;ed to ca&s;t out Kingly op|pre&s;&s;ion, and if the Heads of that Army promi&s;e a <HI>Common|wealths Freedons</HI> to the <HI>oppre&s;&s;ed people,</HI> if in ca&s;e they will a&s;|&s;i&s;t with per&s;on and pur&s;e; and if the people do a&s;&s;i&s;t, and prevail over the Tyrant, tho&s;e Officers are bound by the Law of Ju&s;tice (who is God) to make good their Engage|ments: And if they do not &s;et the Land free from the bran|ches of the <HI>Kingly oppre&s;&s;ion,</HI> but re&s;erve &s;ome part of the <HI>Kingly power</HI> to advance their own particular Intere&s;t, whereby &s;ome of their friends are left under as great &s;lave|ry to them, as they were under the Kings; Tho&s;e Officers are not faithful <HI>Commonwealths &s;ouldiers,</HI> they are wor&s;e Ty|rant and Thieves then the King they ca&s;t out; and that <HI>ho|nor</HI> they &s;eemed to get by their victories over the <HI>Common wealths Oppre&s;&s;or</HI> they lo&s;t again, by breaking prom&s;ie and engagement to their opre&s;&s;ed friends who did a&s;&s;i&s;t them. For what difference is there between a profe&s;&s;ed Tyrant, that declares him&s;elf a Tyrant in words, laws and deeds, as all <HI>Conquerors</HI> do, and him who promi&s;es tofree me from the power of the Tyrant if I'le a&s;&s;i&s;t him; and when I have &s;pent my e&s;tate and bloud, and expect my bargain by his Engagements to me, he &s;its him&s;elf down in the Tyrants chair, and takes the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Land to him&s;elf, and ealls it his, and none of mine, and tells me he cannot in <HI>con|&s;cience</HI> let me enjoy the freedom of the Farth with him, be|cau&s;e it is another mans right?</P>
<P>Such a &s;ouldier as this Engagement-breaker is neither a friend to the Creation; nor to a particular <HI>Commonwealth,</HI> but a &s;elf-lover, and a hypocrite; for he did not fight to &s;et the Earth free from the bondage of the Oppre&s;&s;or, as he pretended by his Engagements; but to remove that pow|er out of the others hand into his own. And this is ju&s;t like the Bea&s;ts who fight for ma&s;tery and keeps it, not relieve|ing
<PB N="7" REF="4">but &s;till Lording and Kinging over the weak. The&s;e are Monarchical &s;ouldiers, not <HI>Commen-wealths</HI> &s;ouldiers; and &s;uch a &s;ouldier is a murderer, and his warfare is unlaw|full. But &s;ouldiers of true noble &s;pirits will help the weak, and &s;et the Oppre&s;&s;ed free, and delight to &s;ee the <HI>Common|wealth</HI> flouri&s;h in freedom, as well as their own gardens.</P>
<P>There is none of this true Nobility in a Monarchical Ar|my, for they are all &s;elf-lovers; the be&s;t is as a bryar, and the mo&s;t upright among&s;t them is as a Thorn: &s;peak you Prophets of old if this be not true.</P>
<P>A Monarchial Army lifts up Mountains, and makes val|lies, <HI>viz.</HI> Advances Tyrants, and treads the Oppre&s;&s;ed in the barren lanes of poverty.</P>
<P>But a <HI>Common-wealths</HI> Army is like <HI>John Bapti&s;t,</HI> who le|vels tha Mountains to the Valleys, pulls down the Tyrant, and lifts <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">p the Oppre&s;&s;ed; and &s;o makes way for the &s;pi|rit of Peace and Freedom to come in to rule and inherit the Earth.</P>
<P>And by this which hath been &s;poken, an Army may &s;ee wherein they may do well, and wherein they may do hurt. Therefore you Army of <HI>Englands</HI> Common wealth look to it; the Enemy could not beat you in the field, but they may be too hard for you by policy in councel, if you do not &s;tick clo&s;e to &s;ee Common Freedom e&s;tabli&s;hed.</P>

<P>By an Expre&s;s from the Parliaments Fleet lying before the Barbadoes, it is certified, that Sir George Ay&s;cue finding the Lord Willoughby to be very re&s;olute and ob&s;tinate, called a Councel of Officers; who&s;e re&s;ult was, forthwith to &s;torm Carli&s;le Block|hou&s;e; for effecting whereof, about 60 Long-boats were compleatly man'd with Sea-men, who endea|vor'd to &s;torm the fort, and to enter the Bay; but &s;o great was the Repul&s;e which they received, that they was inforced to make good their Retreat, with the lo&s;s of 15 men, and to betake them&s;elves for &s;anctuary to their &s;hips again. However, the lo&s;s is &s;uppo&s;ed to be equal on both &s;ides: And the Lord VVilloughby is exceeding vigilant, to make the be&s;t of a bad cau&s;e; for he rides the Rounds (in per&s;on) every Night, from Fort to Fort, promi&s;ing his &s;oul|diers the free prize of the Parliaments Navie; but with this provi&s;oe, I befeech you, when they con catch it.</P>
