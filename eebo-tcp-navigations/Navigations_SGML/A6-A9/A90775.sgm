<HEAD>CHAP.

<P>IN former Times when the Wars were frequent be|tween <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Scotland,</HI> before the two King|doms were united in King <HI>James</HI> the Fir&s;t of <HI>Eng|land,</HI> and Sixth of <HI>Sco<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">land,</HI> the bordering Countries, by rea&s;on of the Inroads that were made, were &s;ometimes po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by one Nation, and &s;ometimes

For building a long Hall on purpo&s;e; he had a Table every Day furni&s;hed for eight&s;core Men, which he not only fed, but kept cloathed, and main|tained in all other Marters; having Hor&s;e and Arms upon Occa&s;ion for the Defence of his Country, ready for them to mount, taking great Delight to exerci&s;e them, having been trained up a Soldier in foreign Lands, fighting again&s;t the Turks and Sarazens many Years in his youthful Days, and done great exploits which made him by many be &s;tiled the Ch<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">mpion of the North, &s;o that he kept the Borders very much in</P>
<P>His Man&s;ion Hou&s;e was called <HI>Guilt-nock-hall,</HI> and his famed to this Day for his living in it, there being &s;mall Hou&s;es &s;tanding in the &s;ame Place, bearing the Name to this time; however, the larger Ruins &s;hews it has been a Place very famous in former, for upon digging, the work|men found the Foundations very &s;pacious; and &s;ome of them have had the Luck to light upon earthern-pots,

<P>HIs Thoughts about Marriage were no &s;ooner known, but out of the Re&s;pect the Gentry and others in the Country had for him, many &s;uitable Matches were propo&s;ed; but as for Riches he lightly regarded it, relying mainly on the bounties of Pro|videhce, he re&s;olved to choo&s;e out one Hand&s;ome, In|genious and Virtuous; and &s;o it was not long e're he &s;aw One as he was pa&s;&s;ing through a Market-Town, that he could fancy; and upon Inquiry, found &s;he was a Gentleman's Daughter, though of a mean Fortune, her Father being fallen much to Decay, by the Lo&s;&s;es he had received by the War between the two Nations, in his E&s;tate and Goods: But this made no Difference between them, the Gentlemah was was glad to put his
<PB N="4" REF="5">Daughter off &s;o well, and <HI>Johnny</HI> was as well plea&s;ed he had met with a virtuous mode&s;t Woman, not with|out a Sufficiency of beauty to plea&s;e him well enough; and the Day being appointed, he promi&s;ed to come and marry her, and &s;o fetch her home to his Hou&s;e. And in order to this, he arrayed his eight&s;core Men in Purple, laced all with Gold and Silver-Lace, with Silver-hilted Swords, embroider'd Belts, guilded Spurs, and Plumes of white Feathers in their Bonnets, and bravely mounted, he rid in mo&s;t gallant Attire at the Head of them; &s;o that the People through the Towns as he pa&s;&s;ed, taking him for the King, they run be|fore him, throwing up their Hats, and &s;houting; nor could they hardly be per&s;uaded by him&s;elf to the con|trary.</P>
<P>His fair Mi&s;tre&s;s was of the &s;ame Opinion, when looking out at the Window, upon the knoc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">ing at the Gate, and &s;eeing her father's Hou&s;e &s;urrounded with &s;o gallant a Troop, fancying it could be none el&s;e, and that he might be a hunting in tho&s;e Parts, and &s;o came thither for entertainment; upon this &s;he run and waked her Father, it being yet early, and told him the King was come with a numerous Train to vi&s;it him.</P>
<P><HI>God forbid,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>what &s;hall we do then? We &s;hall be undone, for all our Provi&s;ions for thy Wedding will not be a Mouthful for them. Indeed the hou&s;e looks fair and promi&s;ing without, though my mean Fortune can allow but lean Coasmons. Go down and tell them I am not at home, I am &s;ick, or any thing to put them off; for better &s;o, than pretend to entertain them, when we cannot do it; better &s;train a Complement, than to be di&s;graced, or at lea&s;t fa&s;t I know not how long after.</HI></P>
<PB N="5" REF="5">
<P>Upon this, down &s;he went, and peeping thro' the Wicket, demanded what brought them to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">er Father's Hou&s;e; to which <HI>Johnny Arm&s;trong</HI> replyed, My Pro|mi&s;e to you, that I would this Day make you my Wife. Upon this, knowing his Voice, and looking wi&s;hfully on him, &s;he could not but fancy him to be what before &s;he had thought, till he alighted, and &s;a|luted her kindly, a&s;&s;uring her he was no other than <HI>Johnny Arm&s;trong</HI> of <HI>Guiltnock-hall,</HI> in <HI>We&s;tmoreland.</HI> Upon this throwing open the Gates, &s;he conducted him in, and run up to tell the Bu&s;ine&s;s, vvhereupon her Father coming down, kindly vvelcomed him.

<P>NOW Matters being at this pa&s;s, the Pages had the Care of the hor&s;es, vvhil&s;t the Men light to refre&s;h them&s;elves; though all the Liquor in the hou&s;e was not a Morning's Draught for them; vvhich made the old Gentleman, the Father conclude that this vvould be a Fa&s;ting-day of a Wedding. But vvhil&s;t the&s;e Doubts and Fears &s;hook him like a Pal&s;ie, all on a &s;udden arrived <HI>Arm&s;trong</HI>'s Cooks and Scullions, tvventy in Number, with a Carrivan
<PB N="7" REF="6">of Provi&s;ion ready to dre&s;s: after them his Butlers, being eight, with another of Wine, Cyder, Ale, and other Liquor; &s;o that it &s;eemed, when taken out, a Plenty &s;ufficient to have &s;upplyed a little City again&s;t a Siege. So to work went the Cooks, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> whil&s;t he and his Bride, bravely mounted, rode attended by his Men to the Church, making &s;uch a Show as that Country had never before &s;een. The People upon Notice of it, coming far and near to be Spectators, &s;ome giving out, e&s;pecially the ignorant Sort, that E|&s;quire <HI>Leonard</HI>'s Daughter had married the King for certain; for as he came out of the Church, he gave a hundred Mark to be di&s;tributed among the Poor, which they fancied none but a King could or at lea&s;t would do.</P>
<P>When they came home, after the Wine of divers Nations had gone briskly about, they found the Tables covered with all manner of Varieties that Sea, Earth, or Air could afford, as, Fowl, Fi&s;h, Fle&s;h, Fruits, and other Dainties; and yet above half was not brought in, &s;o that they were obliged, for want of Room in the Hou&s;e, to have Tables &s;pread in the Court-yard. For the Porter was ordered to make Proclamation, That all Comers &s;hould be welcome that Day; and &s;o till Night they drank and fea&s;ted plentifully; and then his Mu&s;ick and his Ma&s;queraders to divert the Com|pany till Bed-time; though indeed there was not Lodg|ing for a fortieth part of them, &s;o that open Hou&s;e was kept all Night. And he finding the ill Conveni|niency of &s;taying there longer, took his leave of his Father-in-law the next Morning, and conveyed his fair Bride home with him in great State, and with her li|ved very happily, &s;upplying her Father's Wants on all

<DIV2 N="4" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. IV. <HI>How having carried his fair Bride home, &s;he was magni|ficiently entertained: How &s;oon after he had divers Encounters with the Scots, and thereupon a War ari|&s;ing between the two Nations, after the Battle at</HI> Ban|nock<HI>'s Bourn,</HI> We&s;tmoreland <HI>fell into their Hands.</HI></HEAD>
<P>BEing now at home, he &s;o &s;ettled all things in good Order in that Country, that the King of <HI>England</HI> &s;ent him Thanks for the Care he had in pro|tecting Pa&s;&s;engers from Robbers and Thieves, as like|wi&s;e from the plundering Scots, which he made many times go &s;hort home, wherefore they mortally ha|ted him, and layed &s;ome De&s;igns to intrap him, but having his Guard of merry old true hearted Blades with him, he always came off with flying Colours. And during the&s;e Tran&s;actions his Wife was brought to Bed of a fair Son, which much rejoyced Parents Hearts, &s;o that holding a Fea&s;t at his Chri&s;tening, all the Country in a manner, &s;o that the Fame of it rung far and near.</P>
<P>In the middle of this Joy, he had Notice, that a Party of Scots were advanced within ten Miles of his Seat, ravaging and plundering the Country, &s;o that the People came flying before them a pace; but he and his Men mounting, gave them Battle on the Borders of the Country, and overthrew them with &s;o woful a Slaughter, that very few returned to <HI>Carli&s;le,</HI> (which Garri&s;on in tho&s;e Days the Scots held) to tell of the Defeat.</P>
<PB N="9" REF="7">
<P>The&s;e, and &s;uch like Encounters and Depradations, cau&s;ed an open War between the two Nations, which had been &s;tilled for a Time; and King <HI>Edward</HI> of <HI>Eng|land</HI> marched towards <HI>Scotland,</HI> and entred it with a mighty Army, but very ill di&s;ciplin'd; for the Scotch Hi&s;torians tell us they were a hundred thou&s;and, be&s;ides Women, Lackeys, and other Servants, many carry|ing their whole families with them to &s;ettle, when <HI>Scotland</HI> &s;hould be over-run. But <HI>Fortune</HI> was here a|gain&s;t the Engli&s;h, by rea&s;on of their Security and O|ver-confidence in their Number, for in a mortal battle at a Place called <HI>Bannock's Bourn, Robert,</HI> the Scots King &s;etting upon 'em, utterly vanqui&s;h'd 'em with a le&s;&s;er Number, killing about ten thou&s;and of them, with the Earl of <HI>Glouc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;ter</HI> and two hundred Knights, Squires; and on the Scots &s;ide about &s;ix thou&s;and were killed, with divers Nobles and Gentlemen, &s;o that they pur&s;u|ing their Succe&s;s, won <HI>We&s;tmoreland</HI> and <HI>Cumberland.</HI> Our famous <HI>Arm&s;trong</HI> was not at this Battle, but was much &s;urprized at it, and would have per&s;uaded the re|treating Engli&s;h, to who&s;e Aid he was coming, to ral|ly and face about; but wanting a warlike Prince to lead them, it proved ineffectual; and now he &s;ound him|&s;elf con&s;trained to become a Subject to the King of <HI>Scotland,</HI> or leave his fair Seat, which he re&s;olved not do, though his Wife and his Father in-law main<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">y per|&s;uaded him to it, con&s;idering how much he had done again&s;t that Nation, and that he could not well expect but now it was in their Power they would not forget it: But he being of an undaunted Courage, told them, that he had been brought up a Soldier, and what he had done,
<PB N="10" REF="8">was according to the Law of Arms, and that even a ge|nerous Enemy could not but approve it: Be&s;ides, in a little time all might be won back again by the Engli&s;h; and therefore he not being u&s;ed to de&s;pair in Provi|dence, or &s;ubject to fear, would not remove from a Place he &s;o dearly loved upon Sugge&s;tions of Dan|gers that might ever happen, lea&s;t the World might impute to him a Cowardice he was never guilty of.</P>
<P>The&s;e Words put them Silence, and he &s;till went on in his own generous Way of Living, keeping open Hou&s;e, and doing all the Good he could even to the Poor of either nation without Indifferency, that no Exceptions might be taken, or he be branded with Par|tiality.</P>

<P>DUring the&s;e Stirs, the Danes and Red&s;hanks, two bloody Northern Nations, made great Havock in the We&s;tern I&s;les of <HI>Scotland,</HI> where they had landed, and with them joyned &s;ome of the di&s;con|tented Scots, as well Noblemen as others, &s;o that the King knew not who to tru&s;t, &s;ince &s;ome proved treacherous on whom he &s;eemed mo&s;tly to rely; this vexed him, and made him &s;u&s;picious even of his Friends, &s;o that he impri&s;oned many of them out
<PB N="11" REF="8">of Fear they &s;hould joyn with the Engli&s;h, who were making Preparations to recover what they had &s;o &s;hamefully lo&s;t; or with the Northern Enemy, to whom flocked a great many Outlaws and idle Per&s;ons, who &s;uppo&s;ed in the mid&s;t of Spoil and Plunder, they &s;hould be enriched with the Goods and Chattels that others had indu&s;triou&s;ly laboured for.</P>
<P>The&s;e Proceedings made many of the Great Ones whom he &s;ent to, refu&s;e to come to him, lea&s;t they &s;hould be clapt up as the others had been; and then what Accu&s;ations might be brought fal&s;ly again&s;t them they know not.</P>
<P>This made him clap his Hand on his Brea&s;t, looking on tho&s;e that were about him, and with a Sigh, &s;aid, <HI>Ah! is</HI> Scotland <HI>&s;o full of Treachery, that never a Man from the highest to the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">owest Degree, dare appear before his King when he &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">nds for him.</HI></P>
<P>Hereupon an Officer of his Hou&s;hold &s;tanding up, and then bowing low &s;aid, <HI>May it plea&s;e your Maje&s;ty, there is one, named</HI> John Arm&s;trong <HI>in</HI> We&s;tmoreland, <HI>a valiant and tru&s;ty Man, whom I doubt not may do you Service.

Then,</HI> &s;aid the King, <HI>he mu&s;t live by Plunder and Robbery; and of &s;uch there are too many in the Kingdom already. But does he keep any Men to attend him?

<P>Whil&s;t this Dialogue held, in came a Lord whom <HI>Arm&s;trong</HI> and his Men had a little before the Fight at <HI>Bannock's Bourn</HI> routed on the Borders, and re&s;cued a great Booty of Cattle taken from the poor Engli&s;h Coun|try People, and challenged him to &s;ingle Combat, but he dur&s;t not an&s;wer him. Of this mortal Enemy of his the King demanded, if he knew one <HI>Johnny Arm&s;trong,</HI> of <HI>We&s;tmoreland,</HI> and what he was? <HI>Know him,</HI> re|plied he, <HI>Yes, may it plea&s;e your Maje&s;ty, and &s;o does all your poor <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">ubjects on the other, and this &s;ide the</HI> Tweed; <HI>he has been a bitter Enemy to our Countr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">, and is like to be &s;o again, when the Engli&s;h, who now I hear are prepa|paring to make an Attempt upon it; and unle&s;s your Ma|je&s;ty can get him into your Hands, and d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;troy him, and the Ne&s;t of Rebels he keeps, your new Conque&s;ts can never be &s;ecured to you.</HI></P>
<P>This fal&s;e and malicious Report &s;o incen&s;ed the King again&s;t this ju&s;t and valiant Man, that he re&s;olved, if po&s;&s;ible, his De&s;truction, without enquiring further into the Matter; purpo&s;ing to go with Forces, and im|mediately fall upon him: But that was objected again&s;t le&s;t, upon notice of the March, he &s;hould retire into the Engli&s;h Territories, and become yet a more im|placable Enemy: Therefore it was thought advi&s;eable in a &s;ecret Council, called to that purpo&s;e, he &s;hould be &s;ent for to <HI>Edenborough</HI> under fair pretences of friend|&s;hip, and there he and his Train he brought with him, might be cut off without much Re&s;i&s;tance.</P>

<P>Whereupon he ordered his Men to be ready the next Morning, and to put on their be&s;t Apparel, which were Velvet Coats lac'd with three broad Gold Laces, and Scarlet Cloaks with five of Silver, as the mo&s;t modi&s;h Fa&s;hion of tho&s;e times, was al&s;o to put on their gold em|broidered Belts, which were made to hang over their Shoulders, and every one a Falchion by his Side, with a &s;ilver Handle, a Buckler of Steel, and a plume of white Feathers in their Hats or Bonnets. The Emblem of them that they unluckily went into War and Mi&s;chief.</P>
<P>His Commands were not di&s;puted, but in the Morn|ing they were up with the Sun, and immediately had put them&s;elves in array to march; when all on a &s;udden the glorious Luminary, that &s;hone &s;o bright at his a&s;|cending our Horizon, was clouded and overca&s;t, and Thunders began to rumble in the Air, which was the Fore-runner of Rain and Whirlwinds; however, there being &s;ome Signs of clearing up, he re&s;olved to &s;et for|ward, but coming to take his leave of his dearly beloved Wife and little Son, and giving them many tender Ki&s;|&s;es and Embraces, Tears trickled from his Eyes, con|trary to their wonted U&s;e, and his manly Courage fail|ed him, and all on a &s;udden he grew &s;ad and melan|cholly; without being able to give any Rea&s;on for it. But his Wive's Intreaties and his Son's Tears, were too weak to &s;tay him; &s;o with kind Farewels they parted as they hoped, but for a time, but it proved a long one.</P>
<PB N="15" REF="10">
<P>As they rid through &s;everal Towns, the People &s;lock|ed to &s;ee their Bravery; at la&s;t they came to the flowery Banks of <HI>Tweed,</HI> which part rightly <HI>Scotland</HI> from <HI>Eng|land,</HI> and is its Boundary, over which River they pa&s;&s;ed by a Foard, and &s;o rod on towards <HI>Edenborough,</HI> &s;end|ing word before of his coming, lea&s;t &s;o great a Troop might make the City &s;hut their Gates on a &s;udden, for fear of a Surprize.</P>
<P>The King no &s;ooner had notice of this, but he placed his Guards to be ready on the fir&s;t <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">rder to execute his Commands; but when he came to his Pre&s;e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;o nobly attended, he began to doubt it might be a mi&s;taken Ru|mour of <HI>Arm&s;trong</HI>'s coming, fancying it might rather be &s;ome foreign Prince come to pay him a Vi&s;it; where|fore upon his low bowing, the King moved his Bonnet to him in a courteous manner, bidding him &s;tand up; but he was no &s;ooner certified it was he, e're the kind Language was turned into the hateful Names of Villain Traytor, Enemy to <HI>Scotland,</HI> Thief, Robber, and much more of this unexpected Language, which &s;omething &s;tartled him; whereupon he bending one Knee to the Ground, begged Pardon if he had done any thing that had offended his Maje&s;ty; but as for his coming thither it was in Obedience to his Letter, which promi&s;ed him better Entertainment, and &s;afe Conduct, and therefore de&s;ired to know to what end he was &s;ent for, tendring his Service if it might be accepted. No, Traytor, repli|ed he, in a Rage, I need not thy Service, and as for the fair Promi&s;es in my Letter, 'twas to decoy you and your Ne&s;t of Thieves hither; and la&s;tly, the Cau&s;e of &s;ending for you, was to hang you and your Men; which &s;hall be done by eight of the Clock to morrow Morning. At this, the bold Engli&s;h Man ri&s;ing up unconcerned, with|out
<PB N="16" REF="11">out fear de&s;ired he might ju&s;tifie him&s;elf and his Men and be cleared of the fal&s;e Report his Maje&s;ty had per|haps received of them. But the Lord who fir&s;t accus'd him and &s;ome of his Creatures incen&s;ing the King a|gain&s;t him, it was denyed, and the Guards which were about two thoufand, had the Signal to drag them to Goal, and the next Morning to execute them.</P>
<P><HI>Hah,</HI> &s;ays <HI>Arm&s;trong, ha&s;t thou thus broke thy Word with me, thus ba&s;ely to en&s;nare and de&s;troy me and my Men. Well, we are Men, and like Men we will die, if it mu&s;t be &s;o, and</HI> Scotland <HI>&s;hall buy our Lives at a dear rate.</HI> Upon that, looking behind him, and encouraging his Follow|ers to take Example by him, he drew his tru&s;ty Sword, and making at the King through the thick of his Guards &s;truck at him with &s;uch Fury, that he had taken off his Head at the Stroak, had he not nimbly avoided by fal|ling on the Ground. <HI>Arm&s;trong</HI>'s Men &s;eeing their Lea|der engaged among &s;o many Swords, immediately drew; and &s;o laid about them that all the Place was &s;lippery with Blood; driving tho&s;e that remained un&s;lain out of the Palace into the open Streets; wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">l&s;t the Cry aro&s;e through all the C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">ty, as if it had been taken by Storm; &s;o that at la&s;t three thou&s;and more coming upon the He|roick <HI>Arm&s;trong,</HI> being tired with the Slaughter of h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">s Enemies, and faint w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">th Wounds and lo&s;s of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">lood, af|ter &s;ome &s;taggering, fell to the Ground; yet calling to his Men, encouraged them to fight on for after he had bled a little, he would ri&s;e and help them again. This made them like enraged Lions, &s;o that Heaps of dead bodies barred up their way; till at la&s;t over-powered by fre&s;h Numbers, and &s;eeing no way of an honourable Re|treat; they all, like valiant Men, dyed in their Ma&s;ter's Cau&s;e, leaving a bloody Victory, for there fell by their
<PB N="17" REF="11">Hands two thou&s;and five hundred Citizens and Soldiers. The King the mean while was retired to a &s;trong-hold for Shelter; and only of <HI>Arm&s;trong</HI>'s Party a little Page e|&s;caped, to tell the di&s;mal News; at which the Mourning of his Wife and all that Country made for his untime|ly Fall, is more than we can relate: However, his lit|tle Son &s;itting on his Nur&s;e's Knee, vowed to revenge his Death, which, being a Man, he as gallantly performed,</P>

<L>Yes, there is a Man in <HI>We&s;tmoreland,</HI></L>

<L>He has no lands nor rents coming in,</L>

<LG>
<L>He has Hor&s;es and harne&s;s for them all,</L>

<L>When <HI>John</HI> he looked this Letter upon,</L>
<L>good Lord, he lookt as blith as a bird in a tree,</L>
<PB N="18" REF="12">
<L>I was never before a King in my life,</L>

</LG>
<LG>
<L>But &s;eeing we mu&s;t go before the King,</L>

<L>I fear I &s;hall never &s;ee thee again.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Now <HI>Johnny</HI> is to <HI>Edenborough</HI> gone,</L>

<L>he thought he had been a King as well as he.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>O Pardon, Pardon, my Sovereign Leige,</L>
<L>pardon for my eight&s;core Men and me,</L>
<L>For my name it is <HI>Johnny Arm&s;trong,</HI></L>

<LG>
<L>Away with thee, thou fal&s;e Traytor,</L>
<L>no Pardon will I grant to thee,</L>

<L>I will hang up thy eight&s;core Men and thee.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Then <HI>Johnny</HI> look't over his left Shoulder,</L>
<L>and to his merry Men thus &s;aid he,</L>
<L>I have asked Grace of a gracele&s;s Face,</L>
<L>no Pardon there is for you or me.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Then <HI>John</HI> pull'd out his tru&s;ty Sword,</L>
<L>and it was made of Mettle &s;o free,</L>
<L>Had not the King mov'd his foot as he did</L>
<L><HI>John</HI> had taken his head from his fair Body.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Come follow me my merry Men all,</L>
<L>we will &s;corn one Foot for to fly,</L>
<L>It &s;hall ne'er be &s;aid we were hung like Dogs,</L>
<L>we will fight it out &s;o manfully.</L>

<LG>
<L>Then they fought on like Champions bold,</L>

<PB N="20" REF="13">
<LG>
<L>Then they fought on like mad Men all,</L>

<LG>
<L>So there they fought courageou&s;ly,</L>
