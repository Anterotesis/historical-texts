<HEAD>A TRUE RELATION OF THE ACTIONS OF THE French FLEET BEFORE GENOVA.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Together with the me&s;&s;ages that pa&s;&s;ed between the &s;aid Fleet, and the City.</HEAD>
<P>THE <HI>Sieur du Que&s;ne,</HI> General of the <HI>Maritine</HI> Forces of <HI>France</HI> with the Duke <HI>de Mortemar</HI> Lieutenant General, and Com|mander of the Galleys, and the Marque&s;s <HI>Seignelay</HI> Superin|tendent of the <HI>Maritine</HI> Affairs, with a Fleet con&s;i&s;ting of 20 Galleys, 10 Galliots, carrying each 2 Mortar-pieces for Bombes, 14 Men of War, 6 Fly-Boats, 18 Tartanes, 20 Chaloups, and 40 great Fi&s;her-boats ca&s;t Anker on the 16th of <HI>May</HI> 1684. in the Port of <HI>Vade</HI> near <HI>Savona,</HI> depending on the Republick of <HI>Genova,</HI> and &s;ituated between <HI>Savona,</HI> and Final, the Fort of <HI>Savona</HI> &s;aluted the <HI>French Fleet</HI> in the u&s;ual manner, and &s;he an&s;wered accordingly. The &s;ame day being the 16th the Marque&s;s <HI>de Seignelay</HI> &s;ent order to the <HI>French</HI> Con&s;ul at <HI>Genova,</HI> for him to come on board, which he did, and next day being the 17th, he return|ed to <HI>Genova,</HI> with Orders not to demand of the Republick, the Admi&s;&s;ion of the <HI>French</HI> Navy into the Port; but to &s;ignifie to them they mu&s;t clear the two Moles, to the end the Fleet might Anker there on the 18th, and this Me&s;&s;age was, performed with &s;o much Authority and Haughtine&s;s, as if <HI>Mon&s;ieur de Seignelay</HI> had commanded in the Port of <HI>Mar&s;eilles,</HI> where doubtle&s;s he would have &s;pa|red; treating a Governour, that depends on the King his Ma&s;ter &s;o rudely. The Republick made the mo&s;t mode&s;t an&s;wer that could be, giving at the &s;ame time the rea&s;ons, that hindred them from admitting that Fleet into their Ports, becau&s;e of the threats the mo&s;t Chri&s;tian King had &s;ent them by the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Am|ba&s;&s;ador, at &s;uch time as he u&s;ed all good office in their behalf, with him by His Maje&s;ty of Great <HI>Brittains</HI> order, and becau&s;e of the advice they had re|ceived, that that Fleet had not come out of the Ports of <HI>France</HI> upon any o|ther de&s;ign, but to brave that State, but however that &s;hould not hinder them from giving them all the a&s;&s;i&s;tance they could in refre&s;hments, and any thing el&s;e they &s;hould &s;tand in need of: and the republick fore&s;eeing what the effects of their re&s;olution might be, &s;ent immediatly to ha&s;ten the March of a <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Regiment of Foot, which a little before, they had de&s;ired of the Count <HI>de Mel|gar</HI>
<PB N="2" REF="2">Governour of the State of <HI>Milan,</HI> to the end it &s;hould be ready upon the Fronteers in ca&s;e they &s;hould &s;tand in need of it. The &s;aid Regiments u&s;ed &s;uch diligence in their March, that they Travelled 10 Leagues without re&s;ting, and entred the Town of the 18th, at the &s;ame time that the <HI>French</HI> Fleet begun to appear, and draw up in Battel array, about a League and a half from <HI>Ge|nova.</HI> The Town &s;aluted the Fleet as the cu&s;tom is, as much in regard of the number of Ve&s;&s;els and Galleys, as of the Generals, who al&s;o an&s;wered as has been always u&s;ed; and becau&s;e the Deputies that u&s;e to go to compliment the Generals, &s;taid &s;omewhat long, the Marque&s;s <HI>de Seignelay</HI> &s;ent to complain to the Republick, &s;aying, he wondered they &s;tayed &s;o long, and immediatly Six Gentlemen Deputies went out to make him the &s;aid compliment, and offer him the refre&s;hment which is u&s;ually &s;ent; but in&s;tead of corre&s;ponding to the civi|lity of the Republick, the Marque&s;s <HI>de Seignelay</HI> began to exaggerate the di&s;|re&s;pect, that had been u&s;ed towards the King his Ma&s;ter, adding a Thou&s;and impertinencies, and in conclu&s;ion gave them a Paper compo&s;ed of &s;o much haughtine&s;s, and &s;o many extravagancies, that it &s;eemed to have been dictated by the great <HI>Turk,</HI> the principal points whereof were, that the Republick &s;hould yield up to the King their four new Galleys, and one of the others per|fectly rigged and fitted for &s;ervice; &s;hould &s;end &s;ix of their principal Senators, to beg his pardon for their proceedings, and not having obeyed his Orders, to a&s;&s;ure him they repent, and &s;hall amend for the future: promi&s;ing to obey and follow the Orders and Will of his mo&s;t Chri&s;tian Maje&s;ty in all things, and &s;o doing, they might perhaps find grace and pardon for their faults.</P>
<P>The Deputies an&s;wered, they would make their report to the Republick, but this they could &s;ay they were mo&s;t a&s;&s;ured, they had done nothing that they ought to ask pardon for of His Maje&s;ty, and knew the re&s;pect was due to his Royal Per&s;on; that the Republick never had fewer Galleys, and they well knew the Government lo&s;t them, by the frequent prizes the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Pyrats took of their provi&s;ions, and they were now re&s;olved to oppo&s;e it and encrea&s;e the number of their Galleys, by four new ones, without the lea&s;t de&s;ign of offend|ing any body, but to &s;end them to joyn with the Pope's again&s;t the <HI>Turks,</HI> and thought in &s;o doing, they had not failed of their re&s;pect towards His Mo&s;t Chri|&s;tian Maje&s;ty.</P>
<P>The Marque&s;s <HI>de Seignelay</HI> made an&s;wer, that if neither five hours time he had not a &s;atisfactory an&s;wer to what the writing, he had given them contained, he would execute the Orders he had from the King his Ma&s;ter.</P>
<P>The Deputies being returned to the City, and having made their report to the Republick, who con&s;idering how the Marque&s;s treated them in a minute by the full con&s;ent of all re&s;olved to defend their liberty; and having to this effect given <HI>Don Carlo Ta&s;&s;o,</HI> a Per&s;on of great under&s;tanding and capacity the nece&s;&s;ary orders, and cho&s;e him Camp Ma&s;ter General, and Governour of their Armes, the Republick in a very little time di&s;po&s;ed all things for a vigorous defence, giving the po&s;ts that were mo&s;t expo&s;ed to the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> and the term of five hours being elap&s;ed, without their coming to any re&s;o|lution to the Marque&s;s <HI>de Seignelay</HI>'s liking; the Enemies being buried in coming nearer the City, <HI>Don Carlo Ta&s;&s;o</HI> gave the &s;ign with a &s;moke to make ready to fire; but whereas at the &s;ame time the enemies came nearer and de&s;i&s;ted not at the &s;econd &s;ign they began to di&s;charge the Artillery on both &s;ides, and play upon each other vigorou&s;ly, and the <HI>French</HI> to ca&s;t their Bombes and Granadoes, by which the Palace of the <HI>Duke</HI> or <HI>Doge</HI> took fire the third day. The People began to take the fright, the confu&s;ion growing the greater by the burning of two convents of Nuns, which were burnt to the ground, and are tho&s;e of St. <HI>Andrew,</HI> and St. <HI>Seba&s;tian,</HI> whence the Nuns being retired in the night to &s;ecure them&s;elves, all the religious of the other Convents and Mona&s;teries did the &s;ame: in the mean time the People enraged again&s;t the <HI>French</HI> began to plunder all their hou&s;es, and going yet farther, in a little time did the &s;ame to the other inhabitants hou&s;es, but the General <HI>Don Carlo Ta&s;&s;o</HI> &s;peedily remedied it with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the <HI>Spa|ni&s;h</HI> and <HI>Neapolitan</HI> Troops, the latter having come in the 20th day in the
<PB N="3" REF="2">morning; the general took and executed &s;everal of the&s;e Robbers, &s;o that we may &s;ay <HI>Genova</HI> owes its pre&s;ervation to the arrival of the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Regiments that came in &s;o luckily. In Fine, the rabble of the City and that which had flocked in from the Country, was capable with the <HI>French</HI> to de&s;troy the City, but God pre&s;erved it. The Count <HI>de Melgor</HI> &s;ent al&s;o a detachment of the Country foot, and the re&s;t of the Army of <HI>Millain</HI> advanced to the Frontier of this State.</P>
<P>The Count <HI>de Melgar</HI> General and Captain General being come to <HI>Torto|na</HI> on the 21 of this month, to be nearer at hand for whatever &s;hould happen, being adverti&s;ed of the con&s;ternation there began to be here many of the peo|ple and even of the Maje&s;trates having left all with the fright of the fire and Bombes to &s;ave them&s;elves the Count advanced in per&s;on till this place, to calme the affrighted &s;pirits with his pre&s;ents, and encourage them to their de|fence and pre&s;ervation, and in effect it happened: in&s;omuch that from the time he came into the City, every body took courage, and in a moment all order was re&s;tored to the great &s;atisfact, and con&s;ent of the City and its in|habitants.</P>
<P>The <HI>French</HI> continued ca&s;ting Bombes and Granadoes four days and three nights, and the 22th about noon they cea&s;ed and Mon&s;teur <HI>de Seignelay</HI> &s;ent an Officer a &s;hore with a <HI>Folucca</HI> who demanded to &s;peak with the Duke, but it was not granted, and he was forced to &s;tay on board the Admiral Galley of the Republick in the Port, a Secretary was &s;ent to him from the <HI>Senate</HI> to know his me&s;&s;age who &s;aid Mon&s;ieur <HI>de Seignelay</HI> much re&s;ented the damage was done to the City, and if they re&s;olved to &s;end Deputies, and were di&s;po&s;ed to give the King his Ma&s;ter &s;atisfaction according as he demanded, abandon|ing the protection of <HI>Spain,</HI> mercy &s;hould &s;till be u&s;ed; but if they ob&s;tinatly per&s;i&s;t in the &s;tate they are, he can let them know he had already &s;pent 6000 Bombes again&s;t the City, but had &s;till 10000 left him, with which he would ruine the &s;aid City, and gave a farther declaration of his intention in a pa|per. A Coun&s;el was held in ha&s;t, and the juncto of the Government an&s;wered that the Duke not being able to take any re&s;olution alone, he would a&s;&s;emble the Senate to give a po&s;itive an&s;wer: this was done to gain time and prolong this little truce, during which time the trea&s;ure of St. <HI>George</HI> could be &s;aved and pa&s;t into a place of &s;ecurity, as was done that night, when part of it was removed to a &s;afer place, cho&s;e for that purpo&s;e. After which the <HI>French</HI> taking for a full an&s;wer that the Town was more fully re&s;olved than ever to defend it &s;elf, they began on the 23d to play their canon upon the City, and endamage it with their Bombes and granadoes, though with le&s;s violence then before, and being they could not reach farther than they had, the people began to ca&s;t of their fear, and remain firm again&s;t the threats of the <HI>French.</HI> The batteries of the City continued firing upon the Fleet, but without much damage to them, becau&s;e they kept out of the reach of Canon and the Gallies that carry the Bombes are proof again&s;t our Artillery.</P>
<P>The 24th in the Morning the Enemies attempted two de&s;cents, one on the &s;ide of <HI>Bi&s;agno,</HI> and the other on the &s;ide of St. <HI>Peter</HI> d' <HI>Arena,</HI> they were loaded with Bombes, Granadoes, Petards, Faggots, Scaling ladders and other warlike in&s;truments, but tho&s;e two places being guarded by good Troops drawn out of the <HI>Spani&s;h,</HI> and <HI>Neapolitan</HI> Regiments they fought &s;toutly, and the <HI>French</HI> were quite driven from their po&s;ts. On the &s;ide of <HI>Bi&s;agno</HI> were taken 30 pri&s;oners, mo&s;t Officers, and Knights of <HI>Malta;</HI> among the deal was found the <HI>Sieur de la Motthe</HI> Captain of a man of War, much lamented among his People. At St. <HI>Peter de Arena</HI> there al&s;o remained many dead upon the place, Captain <HI>Don Antonio de Luna a Neapolitan Signalireh</HI> him&s;elf extremely, for having broke into the mid&s;t of his Enemies with his Sword in his hand, he killed &s;eve|ral, and among the re&s;t a <HI>French</HI> Captain, and received a wound in his throat by a Musket &s;hot; the <HI>French</HI> betook them&s;elves to a di&s;orderly Flight, leaving behind them Pick-axes, Mattocks, and other In&s;truments they had brought to fortifie them&s;elves.</P>
<PB N="4" REF="3">
<P>The 25, 26, and 27. they continued ca&s;ting their Bombes with all po&s;&s;ible fury, but <HI>Don Ba&s;ilio Marini,</HI> Lieutenant General of the Artillery of <HI>Millan,</HI> who the Count <HI>de Melgar</HI> had &s;ent to <HI>Genova</HI> with a number of Canoneers, having viewed the Order of the Galliots, whence the Enemies ca&s;t their Bombs, and con&s;idered how he could be&s;t annoy them, re&s;olved to make &s;ome artifici|al Fire-works, and on the 28 came down towards the Sea, where he thought he could be&s;t reach them with his Calverins, and &s;ped &s;o well that he &s;unk one of the &s;aid Galliots of the Bombes, and obliged the re&s;t to make off to Sea; and did al&s;o &s;ome damage to the Galleys.</P>
<P>The &s;ame day being the Twenty eighth about noon, the <HI>French</HI> cea&s;ed ca&s;t|ing their Bombes, and &s;ent again a Shaloup to &s;hore, and the Commander of the Ve&s;&s;els of <HI>Genova</HI> having al&s;o advanced half a League in a Shaloup to meet him, and prevent his coming &s;ooner, he found there a Trumpeter with a Letter for a Captain of one of the Galleys of the Republick, called <HI>Lomellino,</HI> by which he was de&s;ired to &s;end word, whether <HI>Mon&s;ieur de la Motthe</HI> was a Pri&s;oner and alive. He took the Letter to &s;ee what an&s;wer mu&s;t be made, which was done, by letting them know that having viewed all the Pri&s;oners, which are very ma|ny, he was not to be found.</P>
<P>The &s;ame day about night, the <HI>French</HI> withdrew all their Galliots of Bombes, &s;ome &s;mall Ve&s;&s;els two Galleys and a Man of War, and gave demon&s;tration of &s;ome di&s;po&s;ition the whole Fleet would do the &s;ame, as appeared next day being the 29th at break of day, &s;teering their cour&s;e to the we&s;t-ward, and it is thought with intention to return to &s;ome port of Provance, whereby the City of <HI>Genova</HI> is left free, to the great &s;atisfaction of the Republick, which openly confe&s;&s;eth it owes its pre&s;ervation to the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> protection, and its arms which latred the City very &s;ea&s;onably, and to the particular activity, wherewith the Count <HI>de Melgar</HI> always acted upon this occa&s;ion.</P>

<P>It is long &s;ince the behaviour of your republick in all things that concern the King, has given you &s;ufficient occa&s;ion to apprehend the effects of his ju&s;t in|dignation.</P>
<P>You have upon all occa&s;ions di&s;covered your union, and adherence to the in|tere&s;t of his Enemies; and you have be&s;ides of late given manife&s;t proofs of it, in &s;uffering the King of <HI>Spain</HI> to take upon him the quality of Protector of your City.</P>
<P>To purcha&s;e this di&s;advantagious protection, you have encrea&s;ed the number of your Galleys, with a de&s;ign to joyn them with tho&s;e of <HI>Spain.</HI></P>
<P>You have refu&s;ed to di&s;arm the&s;e new Galleys, and intended to &s;end them to Sea la&s;t Summer, notwith&s;tanding what was &s;ignified unto you from a Prince, from whom alone you can hope for protection, and who&s;e will &s;hould be a rule to your Government, if you love your own &s;afety.</P>
<P>You have &s;uffered the wrong done to his Mini&s;ters Dome&s;ticks to pa&s;s unpu|ni&s;hed.</P>
<P>You have ruined his &s;ubjects by the ill u&s;age you have made them &s;uffer in their commerce, and have been &s;o perfidious, as to refu&s;e the propo&s;al we made to you, for allowing a Magazine of Salt to be made at <HI>Savona.</HI> It was in truth a thing of &s;mall importance, but however has &s;erved to di&s;cover the more how little re&s;pect you bear His Maje&s;ty, and the difference you make between what concerns him and <HI>Spain.</HI></P>
<P>So ill a carriage de&s;erved an immediate puni&s;hment; but His Maje&s;ty will ne|verthele&s;s of his goodne&s;s grant you time to repent, and take better mea&s;ures.
<PB N="5" REF="3">And that you may divert the effects of his ju&s;t re&s;entments, you mu&s;t pre&s;ently deliver into the hands of his Officers the four Galleys equipped, and give ano|ther well furni&s;hed with its company, &s;o that it be in a condition to go immedi|atly to Sea, you mu&s;t depute four of your Principal Senators to beg pardon of His Maje&s;ty, for your pa&s;t mi&s;carriages, giving him &s;ufficient te&s;timony of your entire Submi&s;&s;ion to his Orders, in all things that &s;hall be laid upon you by him, and in whatever hereafter he may have need of you either for his &s;ervice, or &s;a|tisfaction.</P>

<P>You may judge by the terrible de&s;truction 6000 Bombes have made, what you are to fear from 10000 more that remain. And you ought not to doubt but he is in a better condition than before to make you fale their effects.</P>
