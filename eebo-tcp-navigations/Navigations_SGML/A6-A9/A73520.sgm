<P>_BEing (Right Honorable) no le&s;&s;e then the re&s;t of my deere friends, full fraught with the feruent and duetifull zeale, wherein the whole progenie of vs are, &amp; &s;halbe euerla&s;tingly bound vnto your good L. diuer&s;e wi&s;e: namely, for the &s;yncere Iu&s;tice and pittie, or rather piety, &s;o charitably ex|tended in our late extreame &amp; mo&s;t iniurious vexation. Sounding in equi|tie the depth of the mon&s;trous and dete&s;table driftes and deui&s;es of tho&s;e notorious, lewde &amp; wicked practi&s;ers again&s;t vs, who &s;ought <HI>Qua&abque; in|iuria,</HI> to &s;trippe vs out of what&s;oeuer we po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, without any colour al|mo&s;t, of matter or cau&s;e: but onely pre&s;uming and tru&s;ting to the packing and corruption of the time, and of our innocencie and in&s;ufficiencie to with&s;tand their a&s;&s;aultes. It were a treble tragedie to declare euery circum&s;tance: and needele&s;&s;e, the matter being wholly handled &s;o &s;undrie times before your L. that your Lord&s;hip no doubt remembreth it: and of vs, who haue all their trecherie in records exemplified, can neuert be forgotten: How wickedly they &s;tale away (as they thought) all our e|uidences, and thereupon by what &s;ini&s;ter meanes they wrought her Maie&s;tie a title: howe cunningly or rather cozeningly they conueyed it againe from her Heighne&s;&s;e for three &s;core and ten pounds of money, which co&s;t my friends almo&s;t 3000. li. neere 40. yeares pa&s;t: How they al&s;o altered the tenure from <HI>Capite</HI> to <HI>Socage,</HI> and what vile corruption, notable packing, craftie confederacies, wicked &s;ubornations, vncon|&s;cionable wre&s;tings, &s;ubtill &s;hiftings, indirect pro&s;ecutions, and vnchri&s;tianlike dealings they v&s;ed and pra|cti&s;ed, again&s;t vs poore &s;oules euerie way vnable, had not the right of the cau&s;e found grace before your H. chiefly and other honorable per&s;onages &amp; good Iudges and Iu&s;tices of this land, euen to the glory &amp; prai&s;e of Almightie God in the eye of the world. The continuall remembrance whereof neuer cea&s;ing: yea ra|ther dayly encrea&s;ing, hath pricked me forth, perhaps (as it may be thought) &s;omwhat ouer boldly, al things in equall ballance con&s;idered, (though of two extremities, I haue rather &s;orted to hazard the ridiculous di&s;|daine of pre&s;umption, then the mo&s;t heinous reproch of an vngratefull minde:) euen to pre&s;ent your Honour heere at this time with a <HI>Iewel,</HI> not wrought of Minerals, or &s;et with &s;tately &s;tones, or brought home from beyond the &s;eas by &s;undry our countrie men, in their venterous and worthy voyages lately per|formed.

<P>_IT is &s;trange (gentle Reader) to &s;peake of the breuitie, methode, plainne&s;&s;e and facillitie, whereby this <HI>Iewel</HI> performeth all and that with the vttermo&s;t, which I haue in my title auouched, yea &amp; to be admired, that one onely &amp; &s;o &s;ingle an in&s;trument &s;hould performe &s;o infinite a number of conclu&s;ions, more then I thinke I &s;hall euer haue time to write, and tho&s;e no ba&s;e &s;tuffe inuented to fill vp a volume as in other bookes are many thru&s;t in to &s;mall purpo&s;e. Wherefore be not &s;paring of a little paines at the fir&s;t entrance to vnder&s;tand the particularities of your <HI>Iewel</HI> though it &s;eeme a little harde, and a&s;&s;ure your &s;elfe being once entred, that neuer in&s;trument was more ea&s;ie and plea&s;ant: the 2. booke e&s;pecially the &s;econd part will, I pre&s;ume, &s;ufficiently in&s;truct you. I haue be&s;ides here following &s;et an Index or Table directing to the expo&s;ition of any harde terme chancing in the way. Neuer giue ouer at the fir&s;t reading though any thing &s;eeme hard rather aske a little helpe. And if yee de&s;ire to be excellent perfite in your in|&s;trument, abridge my whole worke, and you &s;hall finde it will &s;tand you in more &s;teede then 20. times rea|ding, I haue alwayes done &s;o with any booke I liked of. I craue nothing for my part but that ye will lightly pa&s;&s;e ouer euery e&s;cape of mine and the Printers, which I doubt wil fal out in ouer many places (the coppy in truth being brought vnto him very defu&s;e and enterlined) though none I hope &s;o great to alter the &s;en&s;e of the matter, which I could not helpe, by rea&s;on I haue bene wonderfully letted as is too too wel knowne to the world, for the&s;e 6. or 7. yeares togither in the behalfe of my friends, who were mon&s;trou&s;ly troubled for no le&s;&s;e then their whole liuings &amp; po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, wherein my part al&s;o &s;omwhatlay, by certaine promoo|ting mates or to terme them more aptly concealed knaues, who after that &s;ome of them had (as they thought) filcht away all our euidences, though by the great prouidence of God the chiefe&s;t were &s;trangly pre&s;erued, then was there no &s;ubtill, indirect or corrupt dealing to be imagined but they practi&s;ed it a|gain&s;t vs. For, ioyning with a famous lewde pettifogger they got by his meanes commi&s;&s;ions out, and offi|ces found vpon &s;telth at plea&s;ure to entitle the Queene thereto as concealed lands, whereby they had it vnder the broad &s;eale before we heard any inckling of it, and came vpon vs with a write of Intru&s;ion, to farther which action, and others after that: they fell to &s;uch packing, &s;hifting, &s;uborning wre&s;ting &s;educing &amp; &s;uch diabolical practi&s;es &amp; that &s;o hardly followed it, that the world was a great whiles <HI>Aequidubium</HI> of our &s;ucce&s;&s;e. It is a world to &s;peak of al their wicked drifts, which bicau&s;e it would be but a gla&s;&s;e, wherein vile people of like di&s;po&s;ition might &s;ee the whole commo~ welth of villanous trechery, I here omit, togither with their names: and the rather I do it, for that in con&s;cience I thinke they would reioyce and glory to bee in print though for egregious knauerie, euen like that lewd fellow that &s;et <HI>Dianaes</HI> temple on fire to get him a la&s;ting name. And yet one of their aunce&s;tors in the booke of monuments is in print alredie looking through a Pillorie which I cannot helpe. Wherfore (curteous Reader if any thing be ami&s;&s;e blame tho&s;e ca|terpillers of the common welth, tho&s;e vncon&s;cionable hunters of mens titles, tho&s;e wicked <HI>Hamons,</HI> being &s;uch, of whom it may rightly be &s;aid, <HI>Qui nunc in terra, viuunt hic qua&s;i viuerra, Cuniculos vellens pauperes de limine pellens,</HI> who hindred my trauailes, &amp; brought me dayly out of cour&s;e with my deter|minations: &s;o that commonly at the ende of euery Terme I was with <HI>Penelope</HI> newly to begin againe my webbe. And for one two yeares togither could &s;carce intende to looke on booke, by meanes whereof my minde alwayes being troubled, and partly by meanes of my young yeares, then wanting iudgement when I wrote the fir&s;t coppy of &s;ome part of this work, I know I haue har&s;hly written &s;ome things therin, wel neare vnto the middle of the third booke, which to this day being aboue 7. yeares betweene, lei&s;ure would neuer allow my riper yeares fully to tranlace to my minde, and therfore you mu&s;t v&s;e a little the more indu&s;trie to vnder&s;tand it. For &s;ince our 6. yeares turmoile in law ended, I haue bene &s;o greatly called away with other needfull affaires, and &s;o much applied for mea&s;uring of land, platting &s;erueying and &s;uch like, that time hath bene &s;horter with me then before. Be&s;ides that I was forced to cut al the prints my &s;elfe to my great paines and let of time, that had it not beene for the importunacie of &s;undrie Gent. my friends who perceiued the &s;inguler commoditie of the in&s;trument, that were de&s;irous to haue me publi&s;h it with &s;peede, lea&s;t time &s;hould by &s;ome meanes haue &s;et it quite a&s;ide, I would either haue had &s;ufficient time to haue fined it, and new written the coppie, or &s;taide it &s;till in my &s;tudie, but being as it is, I mu&s;t reque&s;t euery man to take in good part &s;ome part of my ill hap, promi&s;ing to make amends with a little more diligence in my next &s;ixe bookes of the <HI>Iewel,</HI> which I purpo&s;e with as much &s;peede as I can after the&s;e to publi&s;h. And thus wi&s;hing my &s;elfe pre&s;ent at euery doubt with my hartie good will farewell this 20. of Ianuarie 1584.</P>

<P>IT happeneth often in making of quadrants and other geometricall operations that we are driuen euen from a very an|gle to erect a perpendiculer, either to make or trie the &s;quare angle truely, as for example in this quadrant DEC.

<P>ADmit that vpon thextreame or point E of the groundline DE. I would erect a perpendiculer which to do I open my com|pa&s;&s;e to any rea&s;onable &s;cantlet and therewith on the centre E. I de&s;cribe an arch &s;omwhat bigger then a quadrant vz. HI. cutting the~ groundline AE in D. then on the centre D with the quantity DE. I make an arch cro&s;sing HI. in B, &amp; on the centers D and B. the compa&s;&s;e &s;tyll vn&s;tyrred, I drawe two other arches cro&s;sing without the arche HI in G. then I draw the line GE which deuideth the arch DB in halfe, as well as the 3. conclu&s;ion vz. in F. La&s;tly on the centre F (the compa&s;&s;e remai|ning at the fir&s;t width vz. the width DE) I draw an arch cro&s;sing the arch HI. beyond B in the point C. and &s;o drawing a line from E to C the &s;ame is your perpendiculer de&s;ired.</P>
<P>Note that the arch DFBC. is the iu&s;t quadrant of a circle deuided into three equal &s;paces by the points F and B. eche &s;pace being 30. degrees &s;uch as the quadrant DC is 90. euerie of which three &s;paces you may deuide in halfe as you deuided the arch DB. then will there be &s;ixe &s;paces ech 15. deg. thus may you with ea&s;e graduate a quadrant.</P>

For why? a man cannot go Northwards or Southwards 60. miles but the Horizon altereth a degree of the poles eleuation, either higher or lower, as in the 12. Chapter following is more manife&s;t. And wheras you &s;ee in this figure one meridian Mobile: which in the v&s;e of the material Sphere &s;erueth the &s;teede of al the Meridians and parallels commodiou&s;ly as it is well knowne to him that vnder&s;tandeth the v&s;e of the material Sphere, but a&s;&s;ure your &s;elfe the number of the Meridians are infinite, agreeable to euery &s;malle&s;t diuer&s;itie of &s;ituation. For euery &s;eueral countrie, Ea&s;t or We&s;t, from other but 30. miles, hath a &s;euerall Meridian, di|&s;tant halfe a degree from the other: and &s;o round. And al the Meridians meete and cro&s;&s;e at the two poles as the two Colures do, which are Meridians al&s;o to &s;ome country. But &s;oft, my penne hath runne a little too large of the&s;e Meridians: for you can &s;car&s;e &s;ay that the Sphere hath any Meridian, becau&s;e it neuer cea&s;eth turning: the Meridian circle alwayes cutteth the North &amp; South being deriued of the latin word <HI>Meridies,</HI> in Engli&s;h the South. There is no one point of the Sphere tarrieth a minute in the South, but turneth continually rounde once euery day: wherefore the Meridians are onely appropriate to the Globe of the earth: which is fixed immoueable, and beginne from the Iles of Canaria, as in the 12. Chapter. The&s;e Meridians are like|wi&s;e appointed and imagined fixed in the heauens: and then are called <HI>Circuli horarii,</HI> hower circles. But tho&s;e &s;elfe&s;ame circles imagined &amp; appointed in the Spheare turning dayly about with the Spheare, &amp; all the Speeres cele&s;tial as is &s;aid, are their cir|cles of right a&s;cention, called in latin, <HI>circuli a&s;centionis recte.</HI> and begin from the vernal inter&s;ection of thecliptike with the equi|noctial: that is, from the beginning of Aries, proceeding towards &Cancer; and &s;o round, and they &s;erue to as great v&s;e, in limitting the obliquitie of the zodiack, and euery point of the heauens vniformely: as the Meridians &s;erue in di&s;tingui&s;hment of places on the earth. So that you &s;ee, tho&s;e circles, which the common &s;ort call Meridians, are of three &s;orts: the fir&s;t fixed as it were on the globe of the earth, and there called mo&s;t aptly Meridians. The &s;econd fixed in the heauens and there called hower circles, although they may there aptly ynough be called Meridians al&s;o but for di&s;tinction &s;ake: the third continual|ly moueable with the cele&s;tiall Speeres: and there called circles of right a&s;cention: and all the&s;e haue one &s;elfe&s;ame axtree which by the figure of the <HI>Iewel</HI> you may partly perceiue.</P>
<P>Where as al&s;o there are in the figure of the materiall Sphere, before &s;et to the 6.

For you mu&s;t know, that the number of parallels are likewi&s;e as infinite as the Meridians to be thwact full from thequinoctiall to ech pole, and euery one &s;er|uing to as great v&s;e as any of tho&s;e fiue: as hereafter wilbe &s;hewed in my bookes following. But yet in the Sphere, they are not aptly called parallels, but rather <HI>circuli</HI> or <HI>parallells declinationis,</HI> that is circles or parallels of declination, for that their office is to &s;hew the declination of the &s;unne, Moone, or any &s;tarre, planet, or point of the heauens from thequinoctiall, and are num|bred from him towards either pole, there ending at 90. &s;o that looke what parallel cutteth at any time the place of the &s;unne, Moone, or any &s;tarre, the &s;ame counted from thequinoctiall is called his declination: As for example, either tropicke is but the 23 &frac12; parallel and the &s;unne being there is &s;aide to decline 23 &frac12; degrees, either pole circle is but the 66 &frac12; parallel, and &s;o of the re&s;t, and euen as the &s;unne glides euery day in the zodiacke one deg. forwards, &s;o doth he thereby get euery day a new paral|el whereby the dayes are lengthened and &s;hortned, all which premi&s;es you may al&s;o perceiue by the figure of the <HI>Iewel.</HI></P>

What the Horizon is hath beene &s;hewed in the 4.

Other proofes Geometricall there are, heere impertinent to my intention, and of the mo&s;t would be little regarded: for hardly will they beleeue that a &s;tarre (a planet &s;tarre I meane) &s;hould be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">00. times as bigge as the whole earth: and much le&s;&s;e that euery ordinary &s;tarre &s;hould be &s;o bigge as the whole earth. Therefore againe to my purpo&s;e: in euery horizon the point directly ouer heade, called in latine <HI>punctus verticalis</HI> is commonly called the Zenith: and the point oppo&s;ite thereto, that is to &s;ay, below the earth vnderfoote as it were, called <HI>Nadir:</HI> or to define them more artificially, the&s;e two points vz. the Zenith, and <HI>Nadir</HI> are the poles of the horizon, being 90. degrees di&s;tant from euery part thereof, euen as is &s;aid in the 4. the poles of the world are from thequinoctiall.</P>
<P>The Azimuthes called in latin <HI>Circuli verticales,</HI> verticall circles, <HI>quia omnes tran&s;eunt per verticem,</HI> are great circles of the Sphere, cro&s;sing all at the Zenith deuiding the Horizon into 360. degrees, as the Meridians do thequinoctiall from the poles of the world, and are numbred from thea&s;t point of the horizon, yet after &s;ome, the foure quarters are numbred by 90. ending in the north and &s;outh points.</P>
<P>The Almicantarathes, called in latin <HI>circuli altitudinum,</HI> circles of alitude, are the very like to the parallels of the Sphere be|ginning from the Horizon, then&s;e growing le&s;&s;e and le&s;&s;e to nothing at the Zenith, as the parallels do from thequinoctiall to either pole. Circles of &s;tation are the very azimuthes as &s;hall appeare in the third booke more at large. Circles of po&s;ition are the like, but cro&s;sing at the two ends of the meridian line of the Horizon, as in the third booke. General Horizons be not much vnlike to them, as hereafter &s;halbe &s;hewed, and &s;o of the re&s;t: all which will be wonderfull plaine on my <HI>Iewel,</HI> which hath certaine circles on the <HI>Reete</HI> performing the v&s;es of them all, onely by altering their location, much like a player that playeth many parts with onely chaunging his voice and habite.</P>

<P>I Make this di&s;tinction betweene the words Sphere, and Speere: by the Sphere, I meane the materiall Sphere with all his appurtenances: or more plainely, the whole frame of the world, as wel his cele&s;tial as terre&s;triall parts, in latin called <HI>Sphera.</HI> By this word Speere I meane the &s;phere of any &s;euerall planet, &s;tarre or motion, in latin called <HI>orbis:</HI> and hath both a con|uex and a concaue &s;uperficies: yet euery <HI>orbis</HI> is <HI>Sphera,</HI> but euery <HI>Sphera</HI> is not <HI>orbis.</HI> This noted, you &s;hall vnder&s;tand that the 20. Speere called <HI>primum Mobile,</HI> the fir&s;t moouer, doeth continually whirle about the worlde, vppon the axtrees and poles of the world, euery 24. houres once round, without cea&s;ing, being &s;o appointed by God from the beginning: and al the hea|uens, and all the nine Speeres are as it were perforce rapt and caryed about therewith euery 24. houres, from the Ea&s;t to the We&s;t, and &s;o to Ea&s;t againe, by the onely violence of the &s;ame tenth &s;phere, called <HI>raptum primium Mobilis.</HI> Now the mo&s;t part, and e&s;pecially the vnlearned, &s;eeing this dayly motion in the &s;unne, do thinke that he goeth it of him&s;elfe: whereas both he and all the other planets, &s;tarres, and Speeres go a quite contrarie cour&s;e (but a farre &s;lower pa&s;e) and are caried volens, no|lens (as it were) this way: much like a man, who being in a long barge or gally, in a very &s;wift tide or &s;treame, may walke a &s;oftly pa&s;e, as farre as the barge will giue him leaue, again&s;t the &s;treame and tide, but the &s;treame and tide being very &s;wifte and e&s;pecially if the winde helpe withall, may happen to carrie him a mile backe, before hee can walke the length of the barge forwards: or like as a Spider, that &s;hould creepe about a wheele contrary to that way which the wheele is driuen: Euen &s;o the &s;unne of his owne motion, goeth euery day in the zodiacke, one degree forwards (that is) from the We&s;t towards the Ea&s;t, according to the &s;equele of the &s;ignes: yet, becau&s;e his cour&s;e is as it were again&s;t &s;treame, winde, and tide (that is to &s;ay) again&s;t the motion of the tenth Speere, he is caryed quite contrarie to his owne motion, by the <HI>raptum primi Mobilis,</HI> from Ea&s;t towards We&s;t round about the world euery 14. howers which is done 360. times ere he can performe his owne cour&s;e, that is in a yeare, euen as a man may driue a wheele 360. times about, before the &s;pider can get once about the contrary way. This cour&s;e of the &s;unne in the zodiacke is the cau&s;e of the diuer&s;itie of the times of the yeare, of &s;ommer, winter, &s;pring, and harue&s;t, long dayes and &s;hort.

The &s;unne he neuer goeth one iote a wry, but alwayes keepes in thecliptick line: All the other planets their &s;peeres lie byas cro&s;&s;e thecliptick, which cau&s;eth them to go reeling like a dronken man, &s;ometimes on one &s;ide of thecliptick &amp; &s;ometimes on the other, which reeling is cau&s;e of their latitude, but they neuer go from vnder &s;ome part of the zodiack: they neuer reele aboue halfe the bredth thereof: for to that end the zodiacke hath his bredth appointed him to keepe them within compa&s;&s;e, as to them that vnder&s;tand the theoricks is wel knowne.

In like manner becau&s;e heere at reading the latitude is 51 &frac23; I &s;ay that we dwell in the 51 &frac23; parallel of the earth and that the 51 &frac23; parallel of the heauens (alwayes reconing them from thequinoctial) doth touch our zenith as in this figure you &s;ee: Now becau&s;e the &s;unne neuer goeth farther then the tropicks on any &s;ide of thequinoctiall which are but the 23 &frac12; parallels.

But the&s;e circles being drawne on the globe of the earth, haue contrarie names and deffinitions from tho&s;e of the &s;phere, and are by Co&s;mographers appointed to di&s;tingui&s;h the earth as followeth: They haue appointed fiue zones in the heauens, of which two lie betweene the pole cir|cles and the poles being horible cold and &s;car&s;e habitable vnder them: a third lieth betweene the two tropicks and is extreme hotte, and &s;car&s;e habitable becau&s;e of heate: the other two are very temperate and habitable, and lye betweene the pole cir|cles and the tropickes and in one of them dwell we.

<P>The parallels in Co&s;mographie are onely tho&s;e paralels of the &s;phere that are &s;o farre di&s;tant from other, that pa&s;sing by the zenith of any horizon they alter the length of the day a quarter of an houre, and thequinoctiall it &s;elfe is accounted for the fir&s;t parallel they are v&s;ual 21. on ech &s;ide of thequinoctial.

<HEAD>Of the longitudes and latitudes of places. <HI>Chapter 12.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THe longitude of a place is the arch of thequinoctiall, comprehended betweene the meridian pa&s;sing by the yles of Ca|naria, and the meridian of the &s;ame place, and altereth by going full Ea&s;t or VVe&s;t from any place in euery 60. miles a degree: for Co&s;mographers haue appointed the fir&s;t degree of longitude to beginne in tho&s;e yles called <HI>In&s;ulae fortunata</HI> reconing the degrees from then&s;e Ea&s;twards, and &s;o round thither againe. I &s;ay 60. miles to a degree, but that onely is vnder thequinoctiall, but in euery other parallel, the more he groweth towards the pole the fewer miles make a degree of longi|tude, as hereafter in my booke of Co&s;mography.</P>
<P>The latitude of a place is the parallel wherein the place &s;tandeth reconed from thequinoctiall: but according to Co&s;mo|graphers definition, the latitude of a place is the arch of the meridian of any place betweene the zenith and thequinoctiall, or rather the arch of the meridian of any place betweene thequinoctiall and the parallel which toucheth the zenith, and is al|wayes equall to the eleuation of the pole aboue the horizon. The latitude altereth by going Northwards or &s;outhwards in euery 60. miles a degree. Further you &s;hall vnder&s;tand all places being &s;cituate in, or vnder one parallel round about the earth haue one latitude, and for that cau&s;e they are commonly &s;aid to haue one horizon (though indeede they haue diuer&s;e) and in truth one &s;cituation of the horizon my <HI>Iewel</HI> &s;erueth the~ all as hereafter &s;halbe &s;hewed: the rea&s;on is becau&s;e the &s;un doth both ri&s;e and &s;et at like houres in one of tho&s;e places as in another, and likewi&s;e the planets and &s;tarres. Yet as much as any coun|trie is di&s;tant from another in any one parallel by degrees of longitude, &s;o much di&s;tance of time is there betweene the ri&s;ing and &s;etting of the &s;unne, moone or &s;tarres, in euery &s;uch perticuler place for euery 15. degree of longitude an houre, as for example: there is a famous citie in high Germany called Moguntia commonly Mentz, where printing was fir&s;t deui&s;ed by one <HI>Iohannes fau&s;tus</HI> anno 1453. who&s;e latitude is 50. degrees 10. minutes, not full equall with ours, and therefore lieth not al|togither in the &s;ame parallel, it lacketh one degree and 30. minutes, yet neare ynough for this example except the difference were more: the longitude of that Citie is 25. degrees 4. minutes, and the longitude of our towne of Reading is about 13. de|gree. Now becau&s;e the longitude of Moguntia is greater then of Reading I know that it lieth more Ea&s;t by as much as 25 4/60 exceedeth 13. which is 12. degrees 4. min. &amp; therefore the &s;unne mu&s;t needs ri&s;e 12. degrees there before he ri&s;eth at Reading, that is &frac45; of an houre, or more plainer three quarters of an houre and 3. minutes and little better, for euery houre is 15. de|grees of thequinoctial &amp; euery 4. minutes of an houre is one deg. yet for all this doth the &s;unne ri&s;e at the &s;ame houre there

<P>I Haue &s;hewed before in the 2. Chap. that all the 7. planets haue their &s;euerall &s;peeres one vnder and within another: and in the end of the 9. Chapt. that their walke or proper motion lyeth continually vnder the Zodiacke in length and bredth. And now perhaps you would thinke that their walke, circuite or motion &s;hould be performed about one centre vz. concen|tricke to the earth, as the zodiacke is, which is farre otherwi&s;e: For there is none of the planets which mooueth on the centre of the earth, but euery of them hath a &s;euerall centre farre and diuer&s;lie di&s;tant from it: which excentricitie is the cau&s;e of great toyle in &s;eeking and making rules, tables, and ephemerides for the places of the planets: and al&s;o of faining and ima|gining of diuer&s;e circles, epicicles and hypothe&s;es, to bring tho&s;e irreguler motions vnto &s;ome certaintie: In&s;omuch that of late yeares that &s;inguler man Copernicus affirmeth that the &s;unne is the fixed centre of the world, about whom the earth moueth (not the &s;unne about the earth) and that re&s;t the re&s;t of the planets moue regularly about the centre of the &s;unne &s;auing the moone which like an epicicle moueth about the earth in the &s;peere of the earth 13. times in his yearely motion. But omitting the inuentions of Copernicus, and a number of the re&s;t, I will only heere &s;hew a figure out of tho&s;e which haue alwayes bene before his time mo&s;t in v&s;e to the end that you may the better vnder&s;tande diuer&s;e matters in my booke following. VVhere|fore Saturne being the highermo&s;t planet, I will proceede with his frame or theoricke repre&s;ented by this figure following: wherein the vttermo&s;t &s;pace or &s;peere is the zodiacke of the 9. &s;peere, the next is the 8. &s;peere or &s;tarrie firmament, immediate|ly vnder it is the frame or theoricke of Saturne conteining three orbes or &s;peeres, the two blacke &s;peeres are called <HI>De&s;erentes Apogeon</HI> or <HI>De&s;erentes excentricum,</HI> that is to &s;ay cariers of the Apogeon and excentricke: the white midlemo&s;t &s;hut in betweene them is called thexcentricke, or Deferens epyciclum becau&s;e thepicicle carying the &s;tarre of &Saturn; is carried therein. The Apogeon of &Saturn; is in the&s;e dayes about 13. &frac12; of &Sagitt; thorough which DE a line drawne from the centre of the earth vz. B. and appointing the centre of the epycicle vz. A in the &s;ame line: diuide AB into 80. parts, 4. of tho&s;e and 20. minutes &s;halbe the &s;pace CB. and vpon the centre C. is thexcentrike de&s;cribed, whereby you may well conceiue that when &Saturn; is in A, then is the centre of his epicicle farther of from B. the ce~tre of the world, then when he is in F. by the quantitie of the excentricitie vz. CB, &amp; is then &s;aid to be in his Appogeon aux or Ab&s;is and longitudo Lon|gior, that is farthe&s;t from the earth. In F. he is in <HI>oppo&s;ito augis,</HI> or <HI>perigeon</HI> and <HI>longitudo proprior,</HI> that is neare&s;t the earth. In D &amp; E, he is in <HI>Longitudine media,</HI> that is in the midde way betweene the Apogeon and Perigeon: that is to &s;ay nearer to B then A. and farther off then F. the prickt circle in thexcentricke is cal|led the equants di&s;cribed on the centre G. as farre di&s;tant from C, as C is from B. who&s;e office is to regulate the irreguler mo|tion of thepicicles centre in his excentricke: and where&s;oeuer thepicicle be a line drawen from the centre B. to the zodiack parallel to a line drawne from G. the equants ce~tre thorough thepicicles centre, the &s;ame line as BH. is called the line of <HI>medius motus</HI> and the degree in the zodiacke pointed thereby is called <HI>medius motus</HI> but by a line from B. the centre of the earth through thepicicles, centre is alwayes &s;hewed <HI>verus motus.</HI> Fur|ther the bodie of the planet in re&s;pect of the epicicle is but a point &amp; is carryed about on thepicicles circumference which cau&s;eth him to be direct, &s;tationary, and retrograde: thepicicle al&s;o hath his Apogeon and Perigeon. A number of other mat|ters there be about the&s;e theorickes which heere I neede not mention, as <HI>Equaconus</HI> arguments, proportionall minutes, and &s;uch like: becau&s;e my purpo&s;e is heere but to giue a ta&s;t, that you may not be &s;talled when any of the&s;e tearmes come in que&s;tion.

<P>_BIcau&s;e &s;aith he the making of a Sphere or globe is verie chargeable with his furniture and thereto requireth mo&s;t exqui&s;ite workemen, notwith&s;tanding cannot be made in all points without &s;ome errors, the v&s;e thereof to trauilers comber&s;ome becau&s;e of caryage, hardlie kept and maintained from hurt, and being once blemi&s;hed or hurt not ea&s;ily &s;alued: for the&s;e &amp; diuer&s;e other cau&s;es, ingenious per&s;ons v&s;ed long &s;ince great indeuour to reduce the globe with his circles into a plaine forme. But &s;eing (as it is well knowne to the meane&s;t geo|metricians) that a flat &s;uperficies cannot be equally an&s;werable to a globes Superficies in all points (nay &s;cant in any point) for that there is no affinitie or proportion of a &s;treight line to a crooked, nor of a globe to a plaine: therefore there re&s;ted no other meane to bring this purpo&s;e to effect but onely by the art Opticke, commonly called Pro&s;pectiue: By which Arte artificiall painters v&s;e on plaine tables to &s;et forth buildings or any thing el&s;e in the &s;ame &s;hew of proportion, as it appeareth to the eye in all re&s;pects.

<P>THe <HI>Mater</HI> of my <HI>Iewel</HI> is nothing different from that of G. Fri&s;. as by the great figure you may &s;ee, but be your <HI>Iewel</HI> neuer &s;o little, let the meridians and parallels not be aboue two degrees betweene, as in my great figure they are, and being aboue 8. ynches diametre but one degree, for euer the more circles the better and more effectuall to euery action. VVell then your meridians and parallels &s;o drawne as Gemma Fri&s;ius hath taught, then would I haue euery third di&s;tingui&s;hed with a greater &s;troke, or euery fift if you make them but one a peece. The~ let euery 15. meri|dian be &s;euered with prickes al a long their arches: likewi&s;e let the 23 &frac12; parallel on ech &s;ide of thequinoctiall, which are the tropickes: al&s;o the 23 &frac12; parallel next either pole, which are the pole circles, togither with the two diamet. be prickt, which with theclipticke line drawne byas betweene the two oppo&s;ite ends of the tropickes, as you &s;ee, doe liuely repre|&s;ent vnto you all the chiefe circles of the Sphere, euen as though you had the Sphere or globe in your hand. To the &s;aid prickt houre lines, you mu&s;t &s;et figures the axtree line being 6. of clocke at morning and euining the outermo&s;t meri|dian at C next the handle 12. at noone, and the &s;ame meridian at D. 12. at night, and &s;o the re&s;t but in very &s;mall in|&s;truments: the&s;e figures might be placed on the rule which applied to thequinoctiall line at all times &s;upplieth the turne. So likewi&s;e vnto thecliptike line let the carecters of the &s;ignes be a&s;cribed vz. &Aries; and &Libra; to beginne at the centre &Cancer; at the end next the handle, which end mu&s;t lye 23 &frac12; degrees from thequinoctial towards the North pole as you &s;ee, and &Capri; to beginne at the other ende, the re&s;t in order.

<HEAD><HI>Chapter 4.</HI> How to finde the centres of the meridians three &s;euerall wayes.</HEAD>
<P>AS for the limbe of my <HI>Iewel</HI> it is ea&s;ily to be diuided by my 1. Booke 20. conclu&s;ion into 360. degrees, but fora&s;much as Gemma Fri&s;ius &s;aith, that it is an ea&s;ie matter to finde the centre of three prickes and &s;o pa&s;&s;eth away: he &s;pake belike to Geometricians, for it is not &s;o ea&s;ie to him that neuer read the 5. propo&s;ition of the 4. Booke of Euclide or the like: well, let that be one way: my 15. Conclu&s;ion will in&s;truct you therein. A &s;econd way is thus: you &s;hall in|finitly extend or draw forth the diametre CD, on either &s;ide: then to di&s;cribe all the meridians betweene C. and the centre of the <HI>Iewel,</HI> you &s;hall fir&s;t diuide the exten&s;ion of that dyametrall line beyond D. by laying a ruler on the point A. directing the other ende from degree to degree of the quadrant AD. or from 2. degrees to 2. deg. euen in the verie &s;ame manner as you diuided the diametre CD. by the &s;emicircle CBD. which diui&s;ions in the &s;aide line I haue mar|ked with EFGHIKL &amp;c. beginning from D. then for your better helpe I note all the diui&s;ions of the line CD. be|tweene C. and the centre with the &s;ame letters EFGHIKL &amp;c. beginning from C. And now the iu&s;t middle be|weene
<FIGURE>
<FIGDESC>cosmographical chart</FIGDESC>
</FIGURE> any two notes marked with like letters, is the centre of that meridian: which midde&s;t you may either mea&s;ure out with your compa&s;&s;e, or finde by the 3. Conclu&s;. As for example: in this figure pitch your compa&s;&s;e in the iu&s;t mid&s;t betweene H and H. and there doubtle&s;&s;e is the centre of the meridian AHB. So likewi&s;e iu&s;t betweene K and K is the centre for the meridian AKB. and &s;o of the re&s;t. In the very like manner to make the other halfe of the meridi|ans, you may diuide the other part of the diametrall line extended beyond C from A, by the degrees of the quadrant
<PB N="15" REF="15"> AC, and worke in all points as before, but in this figure I haue re&s;erued it to &s;hew my third way becau&s;e I would &s;aue a &s;tampe. Note that the&s;e circles EFGHIK &amp;c. &s;tanding whole round as here they do, are the very &s;elfe&s;ame circles which are called generall horizons after Stophlers inuention, and are neuer aboue 90.</P>
<P>The thirde way to finde the centres of the meridians is the be&s;t and ea&s;ie&s;t and therefore I alwayes v&s;ed it, but ex|cept euery pricke and lineament before drawne be pa&s;sing preci&s;ely done, it is the wor&s;t: for the bredth of a centre pricke lo&s;t in &s;ome one place will bring you out 2. or 3. ynches in another, yet by this meanes you may know the bet|ter to examine your worke. VVell, then to de&s;cribe the other halfe of the meridians next D, by this third way, you &s;hal find of my poore credite, that euery &s;econde note of the line CD, betweene C and the centre, is a centre to one or o|ther of the notes betweene D and the centre. VVherefore for breuities &s;ake I &s;et figures to all the notes of the line CD. betweene D and the centre vz. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8. beginning from D. Likewi&s;e I &s;et the &s;ame figures to euery &s;econd note in the other halfe of the &s;ame diametre, beginning from the centre of which the note 1. is the true centre to the arch A 1 B. and the note 2. to the arch A 2. B. the note 3. to the arch A 3. B. and &s;o of the re&s;t: but now all the matter is how to come by the centres without the diametre CD. that &s;hall you do very ea&s;ily if you do but giue a note or nicke backwards on the diametrall line beyond C. from euery of the former centres after you haue drawne your arch: as for example, when on the centre 1. you haue drawne the arch A 1 B. then giue a nicke backwards beyond C. your compa&s;&s;e va&s;tirred, there &s;et 5. likewi&s;e after that on the centre 2. you haue made the arch A 2 B. giue a nicke backwards with your compa&s;&s;e at 0. and from the centre 3. your arch A 3 B being made, giue a nicke, backwards at 6. and &s;o of the re&s;t. And now when euery &s;econde pricke of the &s;emidiametre haue plaide their parts, then doeth euery &s;econd of the nickes that you made backwards &s;erue in very like &s;ort: as for example, the nicke 5. is the centre to the meridian A 5. B. and heere mu&s;t you al&s;o giue a nicke backwards and there &s;et 7. and thus continually making nickes backwards e|uery &s;econd &s;erueth your turne, and one centre &s;till finding out another.</P>
<P>Further it is a &s;inguler thing to be noted and mo&s;t nece&s;&s;arie for examination of your worke. Tho&s;e nickes or notes backwards do diuide the diametrall line beyond C, into the verie &s;ame parts as the other part of the &s;ame diametrall line beyond D. was before diuided from the point A by the degrees of the quadrant AD if your worke be exactly done: yet you &s;hall hardly make them agree becau&s;e the mi&s;&s;e of the pricke of a compa&s;&s;e driueth the nicke backwards mar|ueilou&s;ly out of his place, in &s;uch meridians who&s;e centres be farre off: wherefore as I haue often &s;aid, you cannot v&s;e too great care in performing the&s;e things. Hereby you may contrariwi&s;e perceiue that if from A you had diuided the dy|ametrall line beyond C. by the degrees of the quadrant AC. then needed you not to haue made or giuen any nickes backwards but taken for your centres euery &s;econd diui&s;ion.</P>

<HEAD><HI>Chapter 7.</HI> How the zodiacke of this reete may be diuided diuer&s;e other wayes.</HEAD>
<P>I Had thought heere to haue &s;pent a long di&s;cour&s;e in &s;hewing &s;undrie wayes to diuide the <HI>reete</HI> by: which giueth the more credite to the proofe of any experiment when the &s;ame is to be done diuer&s;e wi&s;e, and &s;omwhat it would haue made any man the redier in proiection of the &s;phere for diuer&s;e purpo&s;es. But becau&s;e time is very &s;cant with me and that I de&s;ire an end I will &s;leightly pa&s;&s;e them, the rather for that among&s;t them all the reddie&s;t and ea&s;ie&s;t way is al|readie performed in the la&s;t Chapter. One way had beene with helpe of a table of right a&s;centions, thereby laying the rule in the <HI>Limbe</HI> to the degrees of right a&s;cention an&s;wering euery 5. deg. of the zodiacke, &s;o you may diuide him into 72. fiues, and euery of tho&s;e parted into fiue equall parts maketh 360. which by the 3. Booke and 11. Chapter you may well gather. Another way may the zodiacke be diuided, if you place him on the <HI>mater,</HI> &s;o that the line CD of the <HI>reete</HI> lye euen in the line AB of the <HI>mater,</HI> So doe the parallels diuide him into 360. degrees: or if you lift to go to the co&s;t you might make blind parallels cro&s;sing CD. of purpo&s;e to diuide him by: this may you conceiue by the 4. Booke 4. Chapt. Another way al&s;o is by circles of longitude i&s;&s;uing from the poles of the zodiacke GH. like to tho&s;e which Stophler maketh his azimuthes, or tho&s;e which are drawne in the figure of my Booke. See what helpe here is where no neede is. But &s;ince it is manife&s;ted in my 4. Booke 4.

<HEAD><HI>Chapter 8.</HI> How to place the fixed &s;tarres in the <HI>Reete.</HI></HEAD>
<P>IT is mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary, commodious and plea&s;ant, to haue as many of the chiefe&s;t fixed &s;tarres in your <HI>reete,</HI> as may con|ueniently be put in, without ouer much hurt to the other worke, and hinderance of &s;eing the lineaments of the <HI>mater</HI> vnderneath. To performe this requireth 4. &s;peciall matters to be foreknowne, either by exact tables, or diligent ob&s;er|uations as &s;hall be taught hereafter: that is to &s;ay, the mediation of culmination of the &s;tarres, their declination from the Aequinoctiall: whither, North or South declining, and of what light or magnitude the &s;tars are. The culmination of a &s;tar differeth little from his right a&s;cention, the one is but the degree of the zodiack, the other the deg. of thequino|ctial which commeth to the meridian or any right horizon with the &s;tar. Tho&s;e 4. fir&s;t knowne either by ob&s;eruation as I will &s;hewe in the 3. Booke and 39. Chapter: or by the table following which I haue taken out of Stadius a diligent writer, worke thus: Lay the rule from the centre of the <HI>reete</HI> to the degree of Culmination of the &s;tar found in the table reconed on the zodiack, and draw there an ob&s;cure line, then &s;eeke in the table his declination, &amp; number the &s;ame in the diui&s;ions of one of the lines AB, or CD. from the <HI>Limbe</HI> inwards, and then &s;et one foote of your compa&s;&s;e in the centre, &amp; extend the other to the &s;ame diui&s;ion, then turning the moueable foote about therewith cro&s;&s;e the ob&s;cure line, at this cro&s;sing is the place of the &s;tar de&s;ired, or el&s;e becau&s;e the plate perhaps may haue too large a hole for the true centre you may take on one of the lines AB, or CD. the &s;aide declination and &s;etting one foote of the compa&s;&s;e where the ob&s;cure line cutteth the <HI>reetes limbe</HI> or circle ABCD, with the other cro&s;&s;e the ob&s;cure line inwards towards the centre, it &s;hall light in the former cro&s;sing. VVherefore there &s;hall you forme or fa&s;hion the &s;hape of a &s;tarre with apoint or apex &s;omwhat farther out then the re&s;t, touching onely the preci&s;e pricke of this cro&s;sing. And if this &s;tarre be a North de|clining
<PB N="17" REF="16"> &s;tarre, then let his apex point outwards from the centre directly towards the <HI>Limbe,</HI> if South declining then inwards towards the centre. For example take the great &s;tarre one of the fir&s;t light called Hircus, the Gote, who&s;e culmination by the table following I finde to be in the 13. deg. 0. minute of &Gemini;, or his right a&s;cention 71. deg. 33. mynutes of thequinoctial, both which one line in my <HI>Reete</HI> laide from the centre, doth &s;hew at once, if the point D of the <HI>Reete</HI> be laide to the point A of the <HI>Mater.</HI> But here his culmination &s;hall &s;erue, though from D, I might count his a&s;cention: therefore laying a rule on the centre and the 13. deg. 0. minutes of &Gemini; in my zodiacke I draw an ob&s;cure line: then hauing likewi&s;e found in the &s;aid table the declination of Hircus 45. deg. 5. myn. I &s;et my compa&s;&s;e one foote in the centre, and open the other vnto 45. degrees 5. minutes counted in the line AB, or CD from the <HI>Limbe,</HI> and therewith turning about the compa&s;&s;e doe cro&s;&s;e the ob&s;cure line with a &s;mall arch, then do I make by this cro&s;sing the &s;hape of a &s;tarre with his apex touching the &s;ame point, and directly pointing outwards, becau&s;e in the table following I finde his declination North, thereby writing this name Hircus, as in the figure of the <HI>reete</HI> you may &s;ee. And yet can I helpe you to a neere way by helpe of your <HI>Label</HI> made as in the 12. Chapt. and fa&s;tned in the centre of the <HI>reete.</HI> Lay the <HI>Label</HI> on the &s;tarres degree of Culmination, and by the degrees of the <HI>Label</HI> number, his declination inwards from the <HI>Limbe,</HI> and there &s;hall be the &s;tarres place in the <HI>reete.</HI> Example, I will take another great &s;tarre of the fir&s;t light called Foma hand, or <HI>Fu&s;io aquarii,</HI> I finde by the table following his Culmination the 6. deg. 46. minutes of &Pisces;: vpon which degree of my zodiacke, I lay the <HI>Label</HI> fa&s;t|ned in the centre as I &s;aide, then on the <HI>Label</HI> from the <HI>Limbe</HI> inwards, I number his declination, which by the table I finde 33. deg. 33. minutes, and at the end thereof I make a pricke, which is the place or point of the cen|ter of the &s;tarre called <HI>Foma hand</HI> de&s;ired, whereto I &s;et the &s;hape of a &s;tarre prouiding that the apex point inwards towards the centre, becau&s;e I find in the table that his declination is &s;outh from thecquinoctial, as in the &s;aid figure of the <HI>reete,</HI> you may al&s;o &s;ee. But heere I would haue you to note how wonderfully this <HI>reete</HI> excelleth Stophlers <HI>reete,</HI> which Gemma Fri&s;ius allowed of: for that here you may put in all the &s;tars from pole to pole where in Sto|phlers <HI>reete</HI> you cannot po&s;siblie doe it: neither can you put in any one &s;tarre there that declineth Southwards a-aboue 23 &frac12; degrees from thequinoctiall, except you will make the in&s;trument vnprofitablie huge, for that purpo&s;e onely. As for example, the la&s;t &s;tarre called Foma hand declineth 33. deg. 33. minutes &s;outhward, which cannot be put in Stophlers <HI>reete,</HI> except the in&s;trument be made larger by one quarter of the diametre of purpo&s;e, which will &s;erue almo&s;t to no other v&s;e, and yet then can you not put in all by a number: but now againe to my pur|po&s;e, when you haue in this manner as is before taught, put in as many &s;tarres as you may which to the number of 30. or. 40. in a &s;mall in&s;trument may well be, then mu&s;t you linke them togither with &s;mall branches hand|&s;omly, wherein their names mu&s;t be written, but all in as &s;mall roome as may be. And as for tho&s;e &s;tarres which light among the almicantares, if you cannot there write their names, then mu&s;t you &s;upplie that want by wri|ting them on the <HI>Label.</HI> Al&s;o for their bigne&s;&s;e of light or magnitude, you mu&s;t either file them of three or foure fa&s;hions which you &s;hal hardly do in &s;mal worke, or with the grauer, make them &s;eueral &s;hapes, or el&s;e you mu&s;t deui&s;e to &s;et &s;o many pricks by euery one as may &s;ignifie the bigne&s;&s;e of their light, either of the 1. 2. 3. or 4. magni|tude, which you neede not exceede though they are reckoned to the &s;ixt. Note that in my great figure I haue &s;et to euery &s;tar a number, according to his being in the table following, whereby you may there ea&s;ily finde his name.</P>

<P>HAuing drawne all the lineaments exactly, and placed the points of &s;o many &s;tarres as you thinke good, as before is &s;hewed: then mu&s;t you graue or write in all the figures names, and carecters, of the circles, &s;tarres, and &s;ignes: al&s;o the branches that &s;hall &s;upport your &s;tarres with their &s;euerall &s;hapes and that as exactly, as though they &s;hould not bee filed or cut out: but in any ca&s;e you mu&s;t not &s;tampe any figure, letter, or thing in a thinne plate: one blow may bring the whole out of frame. In any wi&s;e de&s;ire not to make your <HI>reete</HI> of any thickne&s;&s;e, for in v&s;e it will be very vnplea&s;ant in many re&s;pects, the thicknes of a grote will &s;erue very wel. VVhen you haue performed al this, then mu&s;t you with fine files (or being in pa&s;tbord, with a fine penknife) cut out al the &s;uperfluous roomes of the <HI>reete,</HI> and euery greater &s;pace of the almicantares, leauing nothing but the very zodiacke, the &s;tarres and their braunches whereon their names are written, and euery le&s;&s;er &s;pace of the almicantares, as in my great figure you may well perceiue. You &s;hall finde it a very harde piece of worke to file out the&s;e things in mettall: e&s;pecially the almicantares, and to leaue the &s;tarres there placed: and if you be not verie carefull, you may &s;oone &s;pill all: if you can get no file thinne ynough, you may grinde a file on one or two &s;ides till he come to your purpo&s;e. But to be the more &s;ure to keepe the almicantares from di&s;placing, which is all my care, you &s;hall leaue heere and there &s;uperfluous &s;trings very &s;lender in filing euery almicantare, which you &s;hall not file a|way till you haue all done: and if you li&s;t at euery 10. 15. or 20. azimuthes, &s;mall &s;trings quite through, as in the 4. Booke 1. Chapt. is &s;aid, they will not onely keepe more &s;ure the almicantares at their true width, but al&s;o be a great ea&s;e in v&s;e of the <HI>Iewel</HI> for &s;peedie reckning of the azimuthes. And if there chance any &s;tarres in your way, be chary to fa&s;hion them as well as the roome will giue leaue: and alwayes be &s;ure to keepe your drilles, grauers, and all your tooles verie keene and &s;harpe by often whetting, el&s;e &s;hall you both worke tediou&s;ly and hardlie keepe your worke from forcing in thicke plates, &s;uch as the <HI>Mater</HI> mu&s;t be made of: you may be &s;omwhat bolder to &s;tampe &s;mall figures, letters and &s;mall holes, and to peirch, but chi&s;ill you mu&s;t not, nor &s;trike with great poun|ches: I had forgotten it in the 8.

But becau&s;e tho&s;e are not alwayes at hande: and that &s;uch hath beene euer the v&s;e in all A&s;trolabes: it is not a mi&s;&s;e, not to digre&s;&s;e from the olde fa&s;hion. And therefore thus &s;hall you do. Make two <HI>Limbes</HI> ioyning togither the one for the zodiacke or circle of &s;ignes: the other for the kalender or circle of mo|nethes. Let the zodiackes <HI>limbe</HI> containe 3. &s;paces, though in my figure I haue made a &s;hift with 2. the 2. outermo&s;t &s;paces of like bigne&s;&s;e, one to receiue the names or carecters of the &s;ignes, the other their numbers from 30. to 30. which in my figure are both in one, the third &s;pace to be narrow for the deg. being in the whole 360. This <HI>limbe</HI> be|ing thus di&s;tingui&s;hed and diuided by helpe of the 20.

All which performed, draw a line from the centre to the 2. degree of &Cancer;, deuide the &s;ame into 25. parts, and in the neare&s;t of them to the centre, make a &s;mall centre hole placing it on the centre of &s;ome great circle redie diuided into 365. &amp; &frac14; equall parts by the &s;aide 1.

<P>Ianuarie mu&s;t beginne at the &s;aid 21. deg. of &Capri;, the re&s;t in order, all which I haue contriued in the circuler &s;pa|ces without the circle ABCD of the great figure of the <HI>reete</HI> being loth to make a &s;tampe of purpo&s;e, and there|fore marke it well.

And when you haue thus performed the theoricke with the kalender, yet will there be a great roome left: wherein they are wont to make the Geometricall quadrat, and the planetarie houres: but to how &s;mall v&s;e both the&s;e are in little in&s;truments, let them iudge that haue had of them.

<P>HAuing now performed all the &s;euerall parts of this <HI>Iewel,</HI> except you will place &s;tarres in the <HI>mater,</HI> by the 3. Booke 17. Chapt. which I thinke needele&s;&s;e, the handle onely excepted, which is an ordinary thing to make, con&s;i&s;ting of two or three pliant ioynts or lymmoes, &s;o ordered and appointed, that one of the diametres on the back&s;ide may hange very perpendiculer from the zenith alwayes in taking altitudes, as by certaine figures before you may partly &s;ee: I thinke there is now no man of any &s;en&s;e, but can &s;et them togither: yet I thought good to note thus much by the way. Fir&s;t for the centre holes of the <HI>Mater, reete,</HI> rule and <HI>Label,</HI> let them be all of one euen big|ne&s;&s;e, and as &s;mall as is po&s;sible to beare a riuet. For it is a foule fault to haue a great many degrees at the centre, taken vp with the riuette and the loopes. Secondly it would be &s;o contriued if the workman be cunning, that part of the <HI>reetes Limbe</HI> might ride vnder the <HI>limbe</HI> of the <HI>mater,</HI> which for that cau&s;e would be &s;et vpon the <HI>mater,</HI> in manner of the old A&s;trolabes: or if one did but hammer out 4. or 5. tets out of the <HI>reetes Limb,</HI> in euery quart, one, it &s;hal &s;uffice ynough to ride vnderneth which woulde be a great pre&s;eruatiue to your <HI>reete,</HI> lea&s;t euery little &s;train of any thing that &s;huld get vnder it do lift him vp, &s;hould &s;traight breake him off at the loope, or centre hole, being &s;o thin as indeede he mu&s;t be.

<HEAD><HI>Chapter 13</HI> VVhat moued the author to his inuention of this <HI>Iewel,</HI> and whence he obtained it.</HEAD>
<P>_AFter I had no &s;mall time traueiled as far forth as my lei&s;ure wold licen&s;e me, in the mo&s;t part of the Ma|thematicks, namely, in Geometry, Arithmetick, pro|&s;pectiue Co&s;mography, Topographie, men&s;urations &amp; &s;uch like, I think by the &s;pace of 8. yeares or more, and then at the la&s;t being drawne on by the &s;tudie of Co&s;mograpy to the de&s;ire of A&s;tronomy (which 2. ca~not wel be in &s;under) I thought it my be&s;t cour&s;e about fixe yeares pa&s;t, to craue the conference of one Thomas VVhite, Vicar and curate of Berkham being fiue miles from Reading, of whom I heard verie well of for his &s;tudie that way. I went to him, I founde him no le&s;&s;e ioyfull of my comming, then I was carefull of his acquaintance, but his &s;tudie that way was altogither A&s;trolo|gie, Phi&s;icke, &amp;c. where my de&s;ire was A&s;tronomie, &s;o that my hope of his helpe was almo&s;t on the &s;odaine fru|&s;trate: but there I founde &s;uch choi&s;e of Bookes for my purpo&s;e, that I repented not my comming, where he on the other &s;ide hauing heard greater &s;peach then was cau&s;e perhaps of me, and my practi&s;e, in painting, drawing, grauing, and &s;uch like, would needes craue my helpe to make him a Catholicon A&s;trolabe, and to that ende he deliuered me Sconer, Stophler, Roiias, and Gemma Fri&s;ius Bookes, of their &s;euerall A&s;trolabes: but aboue all other he commended vnto me, as there was cau&s;e, Gemma Fri&s;ius.</P>
<PB N="20" REF="18">
<P>Notwith&s;tanding becau&s;e I would be acquainted with all their inuentions, I peru&s;ed them all, and founde that Stoners deui&s;e was very &s;tale, &amp; the making comber&s;ome &amp; vncertaine by rea&s;on of the diffu&s;e traduction there|of. Stophler his was artificall, and in truth that which hath giuen light to all the re&s;t, yet requiring &s;o many ta|bles as there be diuer&s;ities of the poles eleuations in the world, or at lea&s;t &s;o many plates as you require countries: For the a&s;trolabe it &s;elfe &s;erueth but to one latitude which to a traueller into diuer&s;e countries were both charge|able and comber&s;ome: &amp; to a &s;tudent not altogether plea&s;ant con&s;idering he mu&s;t take out &amp; put in &s;til tho&s;e ta|bles that are required. Then I come to Roijas and Gemma Fri&s;ius, which in effect haue al one &s;cope, though Roijas be farre inferior to the other, becau&s;e his parallels be &s;treight lines, and his meridians not arches but rather cer|taine geometricall crooked lines called Ellip&s;es which come <HI>ex&s;ectione piramidis,</HI> and tho&s;e parallels towards ech pole &amp; the meridians towards the <HI>Limb</HI> grow &s;o neare togither that one drownes, another which is a very great fault, whereas G. Fri&s;ius his parallels and meridians haue conuenient &s;paces, and are all of them true arches of circles, and in effect &s;uch and no other then the circles in Stophler be, which he calleth almicantares and generall hori|zons, and therefore mu&s;t needs be more proportionable to the circles of the &s;phere <HI>nam rectilinea ad curuam nulla e&s;t af|finitas.</HI> Notwith&s;tanding al this, though Roiias and Gemma Fri&s;ius were &s;inguler inuentions being generall to all the worlde, yet both of them were &s;o comber&s;ome in my fancie that I could not well brooke them: For be&s;ides that, that they required one or two plates within the <HI>mater</HI> to be taken in and out, and al&s;o Stophlers moouer cal|led the <HI>reete,</HI> to helpe him with his generall horizons, the cunning not little to make their <HI>regula cur&s;or &amp; Brachiolum</HI> exactly, with the &s;crew pinnes ioyntes and &s;uch like, yet when all was done, the working of conclu&s;ions by them &s;o tedious with often a&s;&s;aies and &s;o vncertaine for &s;lipping of any ioynt, or iogge, that without many profers and twi&s;e performance one could not be a&s;&s;ured of any propo&s;ition. All the&s;e when I had read and well con&s;idered I cour&s;ed many a &s;undrie deui&s;e for amendment thereof: at la&s;t though it were long fir&s;t, it plea&s;ed God to &s;uffer me to attaine vnto the very perfection of the thing I &s;hot at, euen to perfect one plate and one moouer to &s;erue to all purpo&s;es redily without profers, which I haue at the la&s;t done: but not without participating &s;ome of euery of the a&s;trolabes before recited, &s;o that my worke might iu&s;tly not vnlike to the fir&s;t columpne or piller in architecture added by the Romans, be called <HI>A&s;trolabium campo&s;itum</HI> if it de&s;erued not a more ample name as the &s;equele &s;hall manife&s;t.</P>

<HEAD><HI>Chapter 14.</HI> Of the definition of the <HI>Iewel</HI> and his principall parts.</HEAD>
<P>TVllie about the beginning of his fir&s;t booke of offices, &s;aith that euerie thing that any man will entreat of, ought fir&s;t to be begunne from the definition: this in&s;trument or <HI>Iewel</HI> therefore (if any man will aske what it is) is a certaine round &s;uperficies or flat forme repre&s;enting the &s;olide globe and &s;phere, and euery circle in them contained or imagined, being &s;o proportionablie, congruently, and artificially by pro&s;pectiue lineaments protracted, that it performeth the whole v&s;e of the globe and &s;phere in euery re&s;pect what&s;oeuer, and rather more then le&s;&s;e and in effect by the &s;elfe&s;ame methode. This in&s;trument or any &s;uch like: &s;ome writers haue called <HI>Pla|ni&s;pherium</HI> a plaine &s;phere, but the mo&s;t part <HI>A&s;trolabum</HI> or <HI>A&s;trolabium</HI> an a&s;trolabe: the fir&s;t &s;pringeth of the tradu|ction or deriuation of the thing it &s;elfe, &s;ounding as it were <HI>Sphera in plano</HI> a &s;phere or globe in plaine forme. The &s;econd commeth of the qualitie or v&s;e called, <HI>A&s;trolabium quia mon&s;trat lap&s;us a&s;trorum,</HI> bicau&s;e it &s;heweth the gliding or cour&s;e of the &s;tarres. And in a&s;much as the v&s;e of the in&s;trument is more often called in que&s;tion and practi|&s;ed then the traduction and deriuation, therefore the named a&s;trolabe is more common then plaine &s;phere. But I finding the v&s;e of this in&s;trument &s;o infinite and vn&s;peakeable, haue not without cau&s;e named it the Mathema|ticall <HI>Iewel.</HI> To proceede further, whereas all other A&s;trolabes haue many, this onely hath but &s;euen principall parts. The fir&s;t is the ring and ioynt whereby it hangeth called in latin <HI>Su&s;pen&s;orium</HI> the hangle becau&s;e it hangeth thereby, or <HI>An&s;a</HI> the handle becau&s;e men commonly take and holde it thereby. The &s;econd is the round brim that enclo&s;eth the worke of the <HI>mater</HI> called in Latin <HI>Limbus,</HI> the <HI>Limbe,</HI> which is as much to &s;ay as the brimme, garde, or cre&s;t of a thing. The third is the worke within the <HI>Limbe</HI> which I will call by the latin word <HI>mater</HI> (the mother) as well becau&s;e it containeth the whole worke of the &s;phere within it, as al&s;o for that it is enclo&s;ed in with the <HI>Limbe.</HI> The fourth is the moouer on the <HI>mater</HI> called in latin diuer&s;e wayes <HI>Voluellum</HI> the moouer becau&s;e it perfor|meth his office by motion, al&s;o <HI>Arabia,</HI> the web, becau&s;e it is cut out &s;omwhat like the &s;piders cobweb: la&s;tly, <HI>rete</HI> the nette, becau&s;e it is like a nette, but I will call it according to the latin <HI>rete,</HI> or rather the <HI>reete</HI> more engli&s;h like. The fift is the <HI>Label,</HI> called in latin <HI>Index</HI> or <HI>o&s;ten&s;orium,</HI> the &s;hewer or pointer of &s;ome <HI>Almuri.</HI> The &s;ixt is the backe of the A&s;trolabe, called <HI>Dor&s;um a&s;trobii</HI> for the mo&s;t part, which I &s;hall call the theoricke, becau&s;e the chiefe&s;t mat|ter there, in common v&s;e, is the theoricke of the Sunne. The &s;euenth is the rule of the back&s;ide, carying the &s;ightes called of &s;ome <HI>Alhidada.</HI></P>

<HEAD><HI>Chapter 15.</HI> Of the diui&s;ion or two &s;euerall di&s;tinctions of this <HI>Iewel.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THis <HI>Iewel,</HI> becau&s;e it is a thing gathered and compounded of all the writers of A&s;trolabes that are common|ly extant, as I haue before &s;aid may be likened vnto the worke of Bees in that, that out of the &s;weete &s;ub|&s;tance gathered of the fre&s;h flowers, is made both the Hony and Honie combe, the one to &s;upport the other, and very like in deede to a <HI>Iewel</HI> that is made of precious &s;tones and golde one to hold in another. Euen &s;o in this my <HI>Iewel</HI> there are two &s;undrie in&s;truments &s;o vnited and compact that the one defaceth not the other, but of ne|ce&s;sitie the one helpeth the other and in trueth without the one the other cannot be general. And euen as the Ho|nie is moi&s;t and the combe &s;tiffe, the golde will be forged, but the precious &s;tones will not melt: &s;o the one parte of this in&s;trument performeth all his conclu&s;ions fixed, the other by continuall motion about the centre. I would not haue you take my meaning that the <HI>mater</HI> &s;houlde be one in&s;trument and the <HI>reete</HI> another &s;euerallie, but they are ioyntlie two in&s;truments for part of the <HI>reete,</HI> and the <HI>Limbe</HI> and all the circuler lines in the <HI>mater</HI> &s;erue to the
<PB N="21" REF="18"> one, and but part of the lineaments in the <HI>Mater</HI> and <HI>Limbe</HI> and part in the <HI>reete</HI> &s;erue to the other, as heereafter followeth.</P>

<DIV3 N="16" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD><HI>Chapter 16.</HI> Of the di&s;po&s;itions of the circles both in the <HI>Mater, Reete,</HI> and <HI>Limbe,</HI> for the fir&s;t and chiefe&s;t di&s;tinction of this in&s;trument.</HEAD>
<P>COncerning the two di&s;tinctions of this <HI>Iewel</HI> mentioned in the la&s;t Chapt, the fir&s;t and chiefe&s;t is in effect a|greeable to Roijas and Gemma Fri&s;ius inuention, and &s;eruing to &s;o many the v&s;es of their A&s;trolabes as are performed without Stophlers <HI>reete,</HI> and to innumerable other, as I will manife&s;t, requiring part of my <HI>reete,</HI> part of the <HI>Limbe</HI> &amp; all the <HI>Mater</HI> to &s;erue his turne. Fir&s;t therefore for this v&s;e the <HI>Limbe,</HI> fir&s;t two &s;paces within the fir&s;t great blacke circle is deuided into 4. times 90. degrees numbred from thequinoctiall line to ech pole. All the lineaments of the <HI>mater</HI> are required to this di&s;tinction, which euery man may ea&s;ily of him&s;elfe di&s;cipher, that hath any knowledge at all, or hath redde my fir&s;t booke. For the circles meeting togither all at two points which are called poles, are meridians or houre circles, the other &s;ort cro&s;sing them &s;quare as it were growing le&s;&s;e and le&s;&s;e from the diametre or equinoctiall line CD, till they come to ech pole, are called parallels. The circles or li|neaments in the <HI>reete</HI> &s;eruing this, are called Almicantares and azimuthes: the almicantares called in latin <HI>Circuli altitudinum</HI> circles of height, are tho&s;e which are drawne in ech re&s;pect like the parallels in the <HI>mater,</HI> and are cut out like the &s;piders webbe. The Azimuthes called in latin, <HI>Circuli verticales</HI> verticall circles, are tho&s;e which are drawne cutting all the almicantares meeting altogither at one point, where the almicantares growe to nothing: which point I call the zenith point of the <HI>reete,</HI> and is marked with A. the&s;e Azimuthes are drawne no otherwi&s;e then the meridians in the <HI>mater,</HI> but that they are cut off in halfe: The fir&s;t Almicantare is the &s;treight line cro&s;sing the centre of the <HI>reete</HI> vz. CD. and from thence are the re&s;t numbred to 90. ending at A the zenith point: this &s;treight line or fir&s;t Almicantare CD, is in truth the horizon or <HI>Finitor,</HI> &amp; is to be &s;et fixed to any latitude, but for di&s;tincti|on &s;ake I will henceforth call this horizon line the <HI>Finitor,</HI> or <HI>Finitor</HI> line, becau&s;e I mu&s;t call other circles in the next Chapter horizons, yet in plaine engli&s;h they both are one. The rule bredth in the <HI>reete</HI> wherein in trueth are wri|ten the deg of the horizon, and therefore might altogither with the <HI>Finitor</HI> line be called the horizon or <HI>Finitor,</HI> yet in re&s;pect it mu&s;t &s;erue the &s;teede of a rule verie commonly, I will call it the rule at many times.</P>

For example, I would &s;et my <HI>Iewel</HI> to the latitude heere at Reading, either I get the height of the pole in&s;trumen|tally as hereafter &s;halbe &s;hewed, or out of &s;ome Co&s;mographers tables I finde it to be 52. &frac23; degrees. The pole on the left hand of my <HI>Iewel</HI> marked with A, is the north pole, from him I reckon downewards 52. &frac23; degrees on the left hande al&s;o, and thereto I place the <HI>Finitor</HI> line, &s;o that the zenith be vpwards towards the handle: and let the <HI>Iewel</HI> remaine &s;o fixed as it were, for there is he placed to our latitude and redie to re&s;olue any que&s;tion you will aske: there pre&s;ently may you &s;ee the &s;unne ri&s;ing, the length of the day, the heightes of the &s;unne, the houre, with a number of other matters, euen this booke full, <HI>Vno momento,</HI> as hereafter &s;hall be &s;hewed: therefore when I &s;ay hen&s;e forwards place the <HI>Finitor</HI> to the latitude, remember this, that I meane place the <HI>Finitor</HI> line &s;o many degrees vnder the pole, as the pole is eleuated in the region or place propo&s;ed, although I might better bidde you place the zenith point of the <HI>reete</HI> &s;o many degrees aboue the right ende of thequinoctiall, all commeth to one, but this is ea&s;ier to vnder&s;tand. And now to proceede farther, the <HI>Finitor</HI> being thus placed vnto the latitude, and &s;o remai|ning you &s;hall vnder&s;tand that your <HI>Iewel</HI> &s;ymetrially repre&s;enteth the verie &s;cituation of the globe or &s;phere to the &s;ame latitude with all their circles and furniture. For to beginne with all, the <HI>Finitor</HI> line repre&s;ents the horizon with the numbers thereof: the innermo&s;t circle of the <HI>Limbe</HI> is the meridian, repre&s;enting al&s;o the <HI>Colurus &s;olititiorum</HI> and alwayes &s;erueth the v&s;e of the meridian or noone line to euery latitude. The points in the &s;ame meridian, where all the meridians doe meete vz. A and B. are the poles that on the left hande of the handle vz. A. the pole articke or North B. the antarticke, the diametrall line lying betweene the&s;e poles videlicet AB, is the axtree line, and repre&s;enteth the <HI>Colurus equinoctiorum</HI> and the 6. of the clocke houreline to euery latitude, the line which cutteth the centre comming from the handle vz. CD, which cro&s;&s;eth &s;quare the axtree line AB, is thequinoctiall, the rule applyed thereto &s;heweth his numbers and diui&s;ions: the circuler lines meeting at the poles AB are meridians and in v&s;e &s;erue for houre lines, and circles of right a&s;cention, of which euery 15. is &s;eparated with prickes to &s;erue our common houres, the axtree line being 6. The circles of like width in the <HI>mater</HI> beginning from thequinoctiall CD waxing le&s;&s;e vnto ech pole, are called parallels or <HI>Circuli parallelli,</HI> and in v&s;e doe limit the declination of the &s;unne, moone, planets, &s;tarres, or any place or point of the heauens from thequinoctiall the 23. &frac12; parallel on ech
<PB N="22" REF="19"> &s;ide thequinoctiall &s;euered, which prickes are the tropickes, and the 23. &frac12; parallel reconed from ech pole, are the pole circles: further the line drawne from tropicke to tropicke, cutting the centre and onely there touching the <HI>Limbe,</HI> is theclipticke line: at the centre is the beginning of &Aries; &amp; &Libra;, the re&s;t in order accordingly, the rule applied to this eclipticke &s;heweth the degrees, and euery 30. degrees make a &s;igne. The axtree line being the 6. of the clocke line at morning and euening, as I &s;aid, euery 15. meridian repre&s;ents the other houre circles, the <HI>Limbe</HI> it &s;elfe being 12. of clocke at noone and night, the re&s;t in like order, as they be figured. Then to come to the <HI>reete</HI> &s;tanding &s;till in the &s;ame &s;cituation, the almicantares are the circles of altitude, reconed from the <HI>Finitor</HI> as in the la&s;t Chapter: the azimuthes are the verticall circles, the Ea&s;t azimuth pa&s;sing from the centre directly to the ze|nith, I call the zenith line, which is al&s;o thea&s;t line, and fir&s;t azimuth, and from him they are numbred towards the &s;outh rounde to 360. Some haue called the Ea&s;t azimuth &s;implie the verticall circle. Now la&s;tly to make &s;hort of all, the <HI>Finitor</HI> being &s;till at the &s;aide latitude, this <HI>Iewel</HI> repre&s;enteth in all points the verie lineaments, that you &s;hould &s;ee on a cleare plaine gla&s;&s;e placed perpendiculer, quite through the midde&s;t of the Globe in the plaine or flatte of the meridian circle, and the eye placed in the point where the Ea&s;t azimuth, and thequinoctiall do meete the horizon vz. in the centre, Or thus more plainely, if you had a Globe of chri&s;tall with all the meridians, paral|lels, azimuthes, almicantares, and the horizon drawne thereon, in the midde&s;t of which chri&s;tall globe, a plaine chri&s;tall gla&s;&s;e were placed, diuiding the globe in the plaine of the meridian into two hemi&s;pheres, and this done you did place your eye in the verie Ea&s;t, or VVe&s;t point of the horizon, and that you could drawe all the linea|ments of the hemi&s;phere again&s;t you on the plaine gla&s;&s;e as your eye there &s;eeth them, they &s;houlde be the verie &s;ame as the lineaments of this <HI>Iewel</HI> are.</P>

<P>THe &s;econd di&s;tinction of this <HI>Iewel</HI> mentioned in the 15. Chapter, is in effect agreeable to the inuentions of Sconer, and Stophler, and &s;upplieth the &s;teede of Stophlers <HI>reete,</HI> and generall horizons, which Gemma Fri|&s;ius would needs haue anexed to his A&s;trolabe, as an in&s;trument by it &s;elfe, but a great deale more effectu|al then it in many points, as hereafter wil appeare, though perhaps it &s;eeme &s;omewhat intricat at the fir&s;t blemi&s;h, yet once in v&s;e, as ea&s;ie as the other. For this &s;econd di&s;tinction &s;erueth the innermo&s;t &s;pace of the <HI>Limbe</HI> and hath two diui&s;ions, the one beginning from the point A, and &s;o leftwards rounde vnto 360. the other diui&s;ion is into twi&s;e 12. &s;eruing to the ordinarie houres: the point A which in the fir&s;t di&s;tinction was the North pole, is now 6. in the morning, an&s;t B there the South pole is nowe &s;ixe at euening, the points C and D in the fir&s;t di&s;tinction bounding the equinoctiall, are now 12. at noone and night, the re&s;t accordingly. Then to come to the lineaments of the <HI>Mater</HI> &s;eruing this part, there is a great alteration, for the innermo&s;t circle of the <HI>Limbe</HI> which in the other part was the meridian, is heere thequinoctiall, the axtree line AB, is here the Ea&s;t line and repre&s;enteth the <HI>Colu|rus equinoctiorum,</HI> and thequinoctiall line CD is heere the meridian or noone line, and repre&s;enteth the <HI>Colurus Sol|stitiorum,</HI> the centre repre&s;enteth the two poles of the world, and the meridians are here become generall horizons: the &s;ub&s;tance of the <HI>Reete</HI> &s;eruing this part is but the zodiack and the fixed &s;tars.

<HEAD><HI>Chapter 19.</HI> A farther declaration concerning the &s;econd part of this <HI>Iewel</HI> for the zodiacke, generall horizons, and fixed &s;tarres.</HEAD>
<P>I Declared before in the 17. Chapt. that the oblique horizons alter with euery degree of the poles eleuation more or le&s;&s;e, but now am to in&s;truct you in two things for your better vnder&s;ta~ding, the one is, that there is accoun|ted but 90. &s;euerall differences of horizons through the whole worlde (in re&s;pect of the latitude, becau&s;e when thequinoctiall is leuell with the horizon, then the pole being zenith can be but 90. degrees eleuated: and being there at the heighe&s;t mu&s;t needs wax le&s;&s;e againe: you will &s;ay there be 90. to the North pole, and 90. to the &s;outh, &s;o there are yet in this part of the <HI>Iewel</HI> one 90. &s;upplieth both. The &s;econd thing I am to minde you of is, that as all great circles of the &s;phere cro&s;&s;e ech other iu&s;t in halfe, as in my 5. Booke &s;halbe &s;hewed: &s;o euerie horizon how&s;o|euer he lie in the world, yet deuideth he thequinoctial becau&s;e they are alwayes both great circles of the &s;phere, in|to two equall parts, and the one halfe lieth on the North part, the other on the South part of thequinoctiall, and &s;o likewi&s;e of the zodiacke being al&s;o a great circle. Further you &s;ee that in this <HI>Iewel</HI> there be but 180. meridians, or rather halfe meridians, euerie one of them being in pro&s;pectiue a &s;emicircle, euen the axtreeline AB it &s;elfe, &s;o that in trueth they are 180. &s;emicircles which are 90. whole circles, and mu&s;t be numbred from the axtree or rather here to be called the Ea&s;t line AB, on ech &s;ide to the <HI>Limbe</HI> ending there at 90. Then &s;ati&s;fie your &s;elfe thus that you haue by this meanes 90. whole circles called horizons euerich of them taken with his match equally di&s;tant on ech &s;ide from the axtree line AB, which line AB is a whole circle it &s;elfe. Then mu&s;t you take this of almes from pro|&s;pectiue, and looke for no demon&s;tration thereof at this time of me, except my lei&s;ure were more then it is: for in trueth it is &s;omwhat holpen by this maxim: <HI>Oppo&s;itorum &s;emper eadem est ratio,</HI> otherwi&s;e it would proue but <HI>rudiori mi|nerus.</HI> I &s;ay that tho&s;e halfe horizons which lie on the North &s;ide of the axtree line AB. that is to &s;ay, next the mid|night point of the noone line, are the North parts of the horizons, that is to &s;ay, by rea&s;on of their inter&s;ection,
<PB N="23" REF="19"> lying on the North &s;ide of thequinoctiall: which here as I &s;aide is the innermo&s;t circle of the <HI>limbe:</HI> and the halfe horizons lying on the South part of AB next the handle of the <HI>Iewel,</HI> are the South parts of the &s;ame horizons: the centre of the <HI>Iewel</HI> being centre to them all: and you mu&s;t imagine, that (they all cro&s;sing thequinoctiall) the one &s;ort is on this &s;ide, the other beyond, and yet are fore&s;hortned by meanes of their erection and depre&s;sion from the eye pro&s;pectiuewi&s;e: and &s;o likewi&s;e for the zodiacke in the <HI>reete,</HI> the North halfe mu&s;t be imagined to lie north|wards, and the other halfe cro&s;sing thequinoctiall to lie &s;outhwards, and to be fore&s;hortned or thru&s;t togither as painters terme it by placing of the eye. Now by this time I hope you wel vnder&s;tand me how the&s;e 180. halfe me|ridians are become 90. whole horizons: I think you be not ignorant that the&s;e 6. &s;ignes &Aries; &Taurus; &Gemini; &Cancer; &Leo; &Virgo; are north &s;ignes that is, alwayes lying on the North &s;ide of thequinoctiall, and the other &s;ixe &Libra; &Scorp; &Sagitt; &Capri; &Aquar; &Pisces; &s;outh &s;ignes, and lying on the &s;outh&s;ide. then will I conclude the &s;cope of this Chapt. which is, that you mu&s;t know and al|wayes remember (therefore note it well) that the North &s;ignes in the zodiacke mu&s;t alwayes ri&s;e and &s;et on the North part of the horizons, &amp; the &s;outh &s;ignes on the &s;outh part, &amp; &s;o likewi&s;e the North &s;tars to ri&s;e &amp; &s;et on the north part of the horizons, &amp; the &s;outh &s;tars on the &s;outh part: note that in my <HI>Iewel</HI> for di&s;tinction &s;ake, the north &s;tarres do point outwards from the centre towards the <HI>Limbe,</HI> and the &s;outh &s;tarres inwards towards the centre. Further though I call them henceforwards north horizons, and &s;outh horizons for breuitie &s;ake, yet I meane the north part and &s;outh part of the &s;ame horizon, or horizons. For the &s;tarres magnitudes looke in the 7. Chapter. La&s;tly the verie point or tippe of any &s;tarre in the <HI>reete,</HI> I will call his apex.</P>

<HEAD><HI>Chapter 20.</HI> How to choo&s;e out which of the <HI>90.</HI> horizons &s;erueth to euery countrie.</HEAD>
<P>BY the 20. Chapter you may gather thus much that the pole articke or point A. in this &s;econd operation is the Ea&s;t point, the point B VVe&s;t: at the handle South, or noone: and at the lower part, north or midnight: &amp; are &s;o to be written in tho&s;e parts of the <HI>Iewel</HI> vz. Ea&s;t, VVe&s;t, North, and South, and nowe to choo&s;e the hori|&s;on to any place, get the latitude thereof either by tables, or el&s;e by ob&s;eruation, as &s;hall be &s;hewed: and then re|membring that the centre is now become the pole or poles, reckon &s;o many hori&s;ons from the centre on ech &s;ide as the degrees of latitude come to, and the hori&s;on there ending is your de&s;ire. For example, I would know which of the 90. horizons doth &s;erue heere for our towne of Reading: the poles eleuation or latitude (all is one) is 51 &frac23; as I &s;aid in the 17. Chapt. therefore for my horizon I reckon from the centre being here the pole, and that north|wards on the noone line 51 &frac23; degrees, and as much on the noone line &s;outhwards, the horizon there, is the &s;outh part of the &s;ame: &s;o I conclude that tho&s;e two halfe horizons are the whole horizon, &s;eruing Reading, &amp; becau&s;e I mo&s;t remaine in that place, I &s;hall haue little neede of any of the other, and therefore I di&s;tingui&s;h him out with prickes or &s;ome other deui&s;e, whereby I may readilie &s;ee him at all times from the re&s;t, and &s;o am I well for my horizon as long as I remaine at Reading, but if I trauaile &s;outhwards or northwards to Northampton, Barwicke &amp;c. then mu&s;t I choo&s;e another horizon according to the latitude of the place, as before, to &s;erue my turne as long as I am there.</P>

<P>THe <HI>Iewel</HI> in this &s;econd di&s;tinction is diuided into foure quarters by the Ea&s;t line, and noone line as you &s;ee. The fir&s;t quarter, betweene north and ea&s;t, is the north ea&s;t quarter, the &s;econd towards &s;outh, the &s;outhea&s;t quarter, the third from &s;outh to we&s;t, is the &s;outh we&s;t, and the fourth from we&s;t to north, is the north we&s;t. Now thequinoctiall alwayes ri&s;eth and &s;etteth full ea&s;t and we&s;t, that is in the points A and B, and therefore as manie &s;tarres, planets, or other points of the heauens as happe in thequinoctiall, as namely of the zodiacke the degree beginning &Aries; and &Libra;, &amp; therefore the &s;unne there being doth alwayes ri&s;e and &s;et full ea&s;t and we&s;t, euen in the points AB, but of all other &s;tarres, points, &s;ignes, and their parts or degrees that lie &s;ome north, &s;ome &s;outh from thequinoctiall, &s;ome part mu&s;t needs lie north, and &s;ome &s;outh from it, and are therefore called north and &s;outh &s;tarres, points and degrees, according as they lie: then in rea&s;on you may well conceiue that if thequinocti|all do alwayes ri&s;e ea&s;t, tho&s;e &s;tarres or &s;ignes that lie north from it, mu&s;t needes ri&s;e on the north ea&s;t quarter of the horizon and &s;et on the north we&s;t quarter. And likewi&s;e the &s;outh &s;ignes and &s;tarres mu&s;t needes ri&s;e on the &s;outhea&s;t quarter, and &s;et on the &s;outhwea&s;t of the horizon: and that which more is, if in any latitude any &s;tarres lie more north or &s;outh then thequinoctials height is, in the &s;ame countrie &s;uch north &s;tarres be continu|ally aboue the horizon and neuer &s;ette, and &s;uch &s;outh &s;tarres be continually vnder the horizon, and neuer &s;eene in that country. An example would not be ami&s;&s;e here to helpe a beginner in the fir&s;t entrance: admit I would &s;ee where about the great &s;tarre called <HI>Arcturus</HI> or Bootes ri&s;eth in our horizon, now becau&s;e I know him to be a north &s;tarre by the 19.

Nowe to know where <HI>Arcturus</HI> &s;ets, turne the <HI>reete</HI> till his apex doe touch the &s;aid horizon in the north we&s;t quarter, and there is your de&s;ire. Then admit I would &s;ee where the great &s;tarre called <HI>Foma hand</HI> being a &s;outh &s;tarre, doth ri&s;e and &s;et, I turne about the <HI>reete</HI> till his apex do touch the horizon in the &s;outhea&s;t quarter, there he ri&s;eth alwayes, then turne about the <HI>reete</HI> till his apex do touch the horizon in the &s;outhwe&s;t quarter and there the &s;tarre &s;etteth alwayes, the rule then applied to the degree of the &s;inne &s;heweth the houre. And in like manner is it with the north and &s;outh &s;ignes, and their degrees: admit I would know where aboutes the 10. degrees of &Gemini; ri&s;eth becau&s;e &Gemini; is north &s;igne, I turne the <HI>reete</HI> till the 10. deg. thereof do cutte the horizon in the northea&s;t quar|ter, and for his &s;etting in northwe&s;t.

A degree in latin <HI>Gradus,</HI> is the 360. part of a circle: <HI>Altitudo,</HI> in Engli&s;h altitude, or height: the &s;ame in all A&s;tronomical ob&s;eruation, is taken by the degrees of a circle, or a relation vnto them.

<PB N="25" REF="22">and againe in the deepe&s;t of winter, being in the winter Sol&s;tice Deduct the le&s;&s;er meridian height, out of the greater, the remainder is the di&s;tance of the tropicks: halfe that, is the Sunnes greate&s;t declination. For example.</P>
<P>In the yeare 1579. about S. Barnabies day, becau&s;e the countrie folke account that the longe&s;t day in the yeare: for two or three dayes before, and after, I watched the &s;unne comming to the &s;outh, and there I tooke his highe&s;t alitude ech day, and I found that the 13. day of Iune the &s;unne had the highe&s;t Meridian altitude, which was 62. degrees that I noted in my book. Then about &s;aint Lucies day in winter, counted the &s;horte&s;t day in the yeare, I watcht the &s;unnes lowe&s;t meridian altitude, and found it the 13. of December to be 15. degrees then of the&s;e two I &s;ubduct the le&s;&s;er vz. 15. out of 62. the greater: there re&s;teth 47. and that is the di|&s;tance betweene the tropickes, the halfe of that vz. 23 &frac12; is the greate&s;t declination of the &s;unne, and &s;o much doth the zodiacke decline from thequinoctiall, and as much doe the poles of the worlde, which are al&s;o the poles of thequinoctial, differ from the poles of the zodiacke.</P>
<P>Heere mu&s;t you note that this greate&s;t declination of the &s;unne hath not alwayes beene found one, of &s;e|uerall authors at &s;eueral times: for Ptolomeus &amp; Ari&s;tarchus, Samius and Timochares, that were 400. yeares before him almo&s;t, did finde by ob&s;eruation that this declination was 23. degrees, 51. minutes, and 20. &s;ec. and from their time hitherwards, it is founde to decrea&s;e by little and little. For <HI>mahometes Araten&s;is</HI> after Pto|lomeus 749. yeares, found it 23 degrees 35. minutes: after him 420. yeares, Prophatius Iudeus 23. deg. 32. minutes. Tho&s;e of our times, as VVernerus, and Copernicus, haue found it 23. deg. and 28. minutes, and &s;o is it thought to be at this time, of tho&s;e that haue made ob&s;eruations With large in&s;truments.</P>
<P>But now by this declination is had the latitude of any place, verie commodiou&s;lie. For example: becau&s;e be|fore I found the &s;unnes lowe&s;t meridian altitude 15. deg. adde thereto the &s;unnes greate&s;t declination nowe knowne vz. 23. degrees. 30. minutes, it maketh 38. deg. 30. minutes, thequinoctials height aboue the horizon, which you &s;hall deduct from the quadrant of a circle vz. 38. 30. out of 90. there re&s;teth 5. 1. deg. 30. minutes, the height of the pole, or latitude at Reading, where I made the fore&s;aid ob&s;eruation. But being made by &s;mal in&s;truments, I haue &s;omwhat erred, for it is heere 51. &frac23;.

<P>This pre&s;ent day being the 7. of Iune 1582.

<P>But here by the way you mu&s;t note, that the circle of the yeare conteineth but 365. dayes, where as in truth it is 6. houres more verie neare, which is a quarter of a day, therefore when you make your theoricke, you mu&s;t know to what yeare it is made, either the fir&s;t, &s;econd, or third after the leape yeare: that knowne, your theorick &s;erueth exactly ynough for that yere to which it is made, but to the next yere you mu&s;t adde a quar|ter of the next day following to your day propo&s;ed, and then take the degree of the zodiacke &s;eruing that, to the &s;econd yeare, take halfe the day following, to the third three quarters, and then the fourth is the yeare of the theoricke againe, and needeth nothing to be added: deuide the yeare of our Lord by 4. and if there remaine nothing it is leape yeare, if one two or three, as neuer it is aboue, it &s;heweth the yeares pa&s;t from the leape yeare. <HI>Example.</HI></P>

Chapter, &s;etting the <HI>Finitor</HI> to our latitude vz. 51 &frac23; deg. I marked where the 12. almicantare reconed from the <HI>finitor,</HI> did cut the 9 6/60 parallel, reconed from thequinoctiall line towards the &s;outh pole, for that the &s;unnes declination was &s;outh, and there did the houreline that cro&s;&s;ed this inter&s;ection &s;hew me that it was 3. deg. pa&s;t 8 of the clocke, that is 8. of the clocke, and 12. minutes pa&s;t. For euerie degree is 4. minutes in reconing the houre at all times, though euerie degree in euerie other re&s;pect hath 60. minutes, and euerie minute 60. &s;econds, and euery &s;econd 6. thirds &amp;c. vnto tenthes. It was 12. mi|nutes pa&s;t 8. and therefore time to go to breakfa&s;t, for him that lay not la&s;t a bedde: I made ha&s;t into the hall where I found my companions at it, and &s;o &s;harpe &s;et, that had not my <HI>Iewel</HI> beene readier then Gemma Fri|&s;ius A&s;trolabe, I had lo&s;t my breakefa&s;t with looking what it was a clocke, and therefore I had great cau&s;e to commend it at that time.</P>

This knowne, take the meridian altitude of any &s;tarre or planet by the fir&s;t Chapter, which if it be found greater then thequinoctials height, then to vs that dwell on this &s;ide of thequinoctial, the &s;tarre &s;halbe north declining, if le&s;&s;e, it &s;halbe &s;outh: therefore take the le&s;&s;er height out of the greater, the remaine, it is your de&s;ire.</P>
<P><HI>Example.</HI> Heere at Reading the latitude being 51 &frac23; the complement of 90. is 38 &frac13;. degrees, thequinoctials height. I tooke the meridian altitude of the great &s;tarre called Arcturus, or bootes, and found it 60 &frac13; degrees, out of 60 &frac23;. there re&s;teth 22 &frac13; degrees, &s;o much is the declination of Arcturus from thequinoctiall, and that, northwards, becau&s;e his height was greater then thequinoctials, and &s;o may you do for the declination of any &s;tarre, plannet, comet, or the &s;unne.</P>
<P>But there are a great many &s;tarres that to vs neuer come at the &s;outh, becau&s;e they neuer come beyond the zenith, which are tho&s;e who&s;e di&s;tance from the pole, is either le&s;&s;e, or equall to the di&s;tance betweene the ze|nith and the pole. The di&s;tance betweene the pole and the zenith, is alwayes equall to thequinoctials height, wherefore the meridian height of &s;uch &s;tarres may be northwards, twi&s;e taken, once aboue the pole and a|gaine vnder the pole. For the declination of the&s;e, take the latitude out of the greate&s;t meridian altitude, and the remainer out of 90. &s;o re&s;teth your de&s;ire. But if you will worke by his le&s;&s;er meridian altitude, &s;ubduct it out of the latitude, and the remainder out of 90. there re&s;teth then the declination &s;ought for. Againe if you li&s;t, &s;ubduct the le&s;&s;er meridian altitude out of the greater, and part the remainder in halfe, and &s;ubduct that halfe from 90. the &s;ame declination appeareth againe.</P>
<P>There be other &s;tarres which come pa&s;t the zenith, and yet neuer &s;et: their declination may be had both wayes.

<P>TO tho&s;e onely that dwell vnder thequinoctiall, all the &s;tarres of the firmament do both ri&s;e and &s;et eue|rie 24. houres: but to tho&s;e that haue either pole eleuated, by howe much the more it is eleuated, by &s;o much the more number of &s;tarres are continually aboue the horizon, and as many continually vnder, in &s;omuch that where the pole is zenith, the one halfe is euer aboue, the other vnder. By tho&s;e &s;tarres that are alwayes aboue any horizon may the latitude be thus found.</P>
<P>Take both the meridian altitudes of the &s;tarre vz. the highe&s;t and lowe&s;t altitudes in the meridian, as in the 7. there will be 12. houres betweene the&s;e altitudes, and yet oftentimes it may be done in a winters night, otherwi&s;e you mu&s;t haue certaine monethes &s;pace betweene. Adde the two altitudes, the halfe thereof is the poles eleuation.</P>
<P>Take here Gemma Fri&s;ius example.

<HEAD><HI>Chapter 18.</HI> The declination of fixed &s;tarres propo&s;ed with their latitude, which neuer altereth, how to finde their longitude in the zodiacke.</HEAD>
<Q><BIBL>Gemma Fri&s;ius. <HI>21.</HI></BIBL></Q>
<P>THe like Hipothe&s;is did Ptolomeus v&s;e, &amp; before him Hipparchus Samius, whereby they found that the &s;phere of the fixed &s;tarres, had al&s;o a motion contrary to the fir&s;t mouer, and that it is perfourmed ac|cording to the motion of the Zodiacke, and about his poles. For in&s;omuch as the latitude of all the fixed &s;tarres from the Eclipticke, hath alwayes beene found one, and neuer altering, both of old writers and al&s;o of tho&s;e which now do ob&s;erue the motions out of the heauen it &s;elfe, and that it is mo&s;t certaine that the &s;tarres do continually goe forwards (from the Equinoctiall points, de&s;cribing circles parallell to the Eclipticke) they cannot therefore performe tho&s;e motions vpon any other then his poles. And hereby it commeth to pa&s;&s;e, that although they be always of like di&s;tance from the Eclipticke, yet they come neere or depart further off from the Equinoctiall.</P>
<P>It is &s;hewed in the 7. Chapter how to get their declination from thequinoctiall: their latitude may be ta|ken out of Ptolomeus tables, or any other, becau&s;e they neuer chaunge. Let vs therefore take an example out of Ptolomeus, who &s;aith that Timochares which liued 432. yeares before him, did ob&s;erue the &s;tarre cal|led Spica, in his time to be declining north from thequinoctial 1. deg. &frac25; that is 24. minutes, but in the time of Ptolomeus, he was &s;outh from thequinoctiall halfe a degree, my de&s;ire is to knowe the true places of Spica, that is his longitude &amp; latitude for both tho&s;e times propo&s;ed. The latitude of Spica is 2. degrees &s;outh from theclipticke, therefore I place the <HI>Finitor</HI> to theclipticke, the zenith towards the &s;outh pole of the <HI>mater,</HI> for that the latitude is &s;outh: and there do I note where the latitude of Spica being here the &s;econd almicantare, and his declination for Timocharis time being 1 &frac25; parallel northwards, do cro&s;&s;e the azimuth pa&s;sing on the &s;ame cro&s;sing to theclipticke, doth &s;hew the 22. deg. of &Virgo;, the longitude of Spica for Timocharis time. In like manner working, you may finde his longitude for Ptolomeus time, to be in the 26 &frac13; degrees of &Virgo;.</P>
<P>VVhereby al&s;o Ptolomeus did gather that the fixed &s;tarres did go forwards one deg. in an hundred yeares according to the &s;equele of the &s;ignes, becau&s;e betweene him and Timocharis pa&s;&s;ed 432 yeares. But nowe &s;in&s;e Ptolomeus ob&s;eruations, the fixed &s;tars haue gone forwards 21. deg. almo&s;t, for now Spica is in the 17. of &Libra; 36. minutes. Therefore to one degree there cannot alwayes be giuen an 100. yeare: &s;ince there are but 1406. yeares pa&s;&s;ed, but making e&s;timation according to this rate, the &s;tarres &s;hould bee mooued one deg. in 67. yeares, yet we mu&s;t account of ancient writers, as we would haue ours accounted of, and confe&s;&s;e that there is a certaine <HI>Anomalion</HI> or inequallitie of motion in the fixed &s;tarres, which no man hath hither vnto better coequated then Copernicus.</P>

<P>The climates are parallel circles on the earth corre&s;pondent to the parallel of the &s;phere, in whiche the longe&s;t day of the yeere is increa&s;ed or &s;hortned halfe an houre. The Geographical parallels are the like cir|cles, encrea&s;ing the longe&s;t day a quarter of an houre. The Climates begin from the fourth of the&s;e parallels, of which the Equinoctial is the fir&s;t, &s;o that the midde&s;t of the fir&s;t climate hath his longe&s;t day, 13. houres which midde&s;t the 5. of the&s;e parallels doth determine. Looke hereof in my 1. Booke, chap. 10.</P>
<P>Therefore by the quantitye of the longe&s;t daye, you maye knowe vnder what parallell or cly|mate any countrey is &s;cituate in this manner. Out of the number of the houres of the longe&s;t day, take 12. the remainder, reduce to quarters of houres, to which adding one the number and order of the parallel de&s;ired, is knowen.</P>
<P>As in example, here at Reading the longe&s;t day is 16. houres, and quarter of an houre long, &amp; &s;omwhat

<P>But if any man would proceede beyond the pole circle, to know the latitude where the longe&s;t day is two monethes, or 60. dayes, take halfe that number videl. 30. and in theclipticke line, reckon &s;o many vz. 30. from &Cancer; towards the centre, it endeth at 0. in &Leo;.

Likewi&s;e for his &s;etting the &s;ame day (or rather night I might &s;ay) I laide the &s;tarres apex on the Southwe&s;t part of the &s;ame horizon, and the <HI>Label</HI> to the &s;aide degree of the &s;un, it &s;heweth in the <HI>Limbe</HI> 3. of the clocke and 8. degrees pa&s;t, that is 32. minutes after 3. of the clocke in the morning, at which time <HI>Canis maior</HI> did &s;et againe vnder our horizon that day.</P>
<P>But if you would know the ri&s;ing and &s;etting of any &s;tarre that is not made or placed in the <HI>Reete,</HI> then by the 21. get his &s;emidiurnall arch, and reckon the &s;ame on the <HI>Limbe</HI> from the noone point Ea&s;twards, and thereto lay the rule, then turning about the <HI>Reete,</HI> place euen with the rule the deg. of mediation, or culminati|on of the &s;tar, that is, the deg. of theclipticke, ri&s;ing with the &s;ame &s;tarre in a right horizon by the 11. Chap|ter: that done, turne the rule without mouing the <HI>Reete</HI> vnto the degree of the &s;unne, &amp; it &s;hall &s;hew as before, the houre &s;ought for.</P>
<P>Admit for example that <HI>Canis maior</HI> were not in my <HI>Reete,</HI> therefore I gette his &s;emidiurnall arch, which by the 21. Chapt. I finde to be in 68. deg. &frac34; or 4 houres, and 8 &frac34; degrees all is one, which being reckoned on the <HI>Limbe</HI> from noone Ea&s;twards, I lay thereto the rule, then by the 11. finding that the degree of culmination of <HI>Canis maior</HI> is the 6 &frac12; deg. of &Cancer;, I lay the &s;ame euen with the rule, and there the <HI>Reete</HI> re&s;ting, I turne the rule to the degree of the &s;unne, as before vz. 21. of &Capri;, there I finde in the <HI>Limbe</HI> 5. degrees after 6. of the clocke, as be|fore, the ri&s;ing of <HI>Canis maior:</HI> and for his &s;etting I reckon 68 &frac34; deg. from noone we&s;twards, and thereto lay his culmination vz. 6 &frac12; of &Cancer;, and thence turning the rule to the 21. of &Capri; it &s;heweth there in the <HI>Limbe</HI> 8. deg. pa&s;t 3. in the morning, his &s;etting, as before.

<PB N="37" REF="28"> A&s;tronomers haue held opinion that the &s;euen planets in order haue dominion, the&s;e houres giuing that pla|nette to the fir&s;t houre of the day, after which hee is called as on &s;unday, &Sun; hath the fir&s;t houre the next &Venus; then &Merc; &Moon; &Saturn; &Jupit; &Mars;, which endeth in the 7. houre, and then beginne agayne the 8. houre with &Sun;, and then forwards &Venus; &Merc;, &amp;c. as before with the 12. night houres al&s;o, and you &s;hal finde that &Moon; will hitte righte to begin the 1. houre of the day following, whereof the day hath his name, which is the cau&s;e that the week dayes are not named according to the order of the planets.</P>
<P><HI>Blagraue.</HI> Gemma Fri&s;ius appoynteth a particuler quadrant on the backe of the A&s;trolabe for the plane|tary houres, eyther the &s;ame, or very like it which Stophler appointed, but I like not to haue any thing parti|cular to one latitude, in &s;o general a <HI>Iewell.</HI> I would rather doe thus: deuide the &s;emidiurnall arch by 6. and by the quotient, deuyde the arche of the houre &s;ought from Sun ri&s;ing: as for example, the Sun being in the beginning of &Cancer; the &s;emidiurnal arch is 124. deuide that by 6. the quotie~t is 20. 4/6 deg. admit at 10. a clocke before noone, I would know the planetary houre, the arch thereof to the <HI>Finitor</HI> is 94. deuide that by 20. &amp; let the 4/6 alone, thence commeth 4 14/20 that is to &s;ay, the 4. planetary houre, and 14/20 pa&s;t, that is as good as &frac23; partes.</P>
<P>But for tho&s;e that canne no Arithmeticke, an ea&s;ier waye is thus, and for that cau&s;e chieflye did I di&s;tin|gui&s;h all my meridians by &s;ixes, with great &s;trokes: beginne from the <HI>Finitor</HI> with the next fixt meridian that cutteth the paralel of the &s;un, and thence tell euery 6. on the &s;ame parallel with a &s;ticke as they &s;ay, vnto the <HI>Limbe,</HI> and count how many they be, and looke how many fixes you haue on that parallel, &s;o manye degrees reckon to euery planetary houre on the &s;ame parallel, as before in the la&s;t example: you &s;hall finde 20. &s;ixes, and foure degrees ouer: re&s;pect not tho&s;e 4. but go on with 20. for the fir&s;t planetary houre from the <HI>Finitor,</HI> and 20. for the next: and &s;o on till you come to the 10. houre de&s;ired, and if you will work exqui&s;itely for e|uery planetary houre reckoned, account 4. and then &s;ee how oft you can take out 6. &amp; &s;o many degrees, adde to the end of your reckoning, and &s;o haue you the planetary houre exactly, as in example before, at 10. of the clocke, it was found the fourth planetary houre, almo&s;t the 5. therfore I heape 4. together 5. times, it maketh 20. thence, I can take 6. 3. times: which 3. I adde to the planetary houre before found: &s;o that now it is the 4 17/20 houre, that is almo&s;t the fift.</P>
<P>Al&s;o the <HI>Finitor</HI> being &s;et to the latitude, he that would deuide the 3. arches of the Equinoctiall, and the two tropicks, into &s;ixe equall partes betweene the <HI>Finitor</HI> and the <HI>Limbe,</HI> and &s;o draw arches from tropicke to tropicke, by helpe of eche of the&s;e 3 pricks, might &s;o haue the planetary houres for that latitude, but this be|ing particuler, is not conuenient in the <HI>Iewell.</HI> But if any man did deuide euery 3. parallel betweene the tro|picks in 6. parts, and did but only &s;et great perceiueable pricks at euery part, it would &s;erue and not muche hurt.

<Q><BIBL>Gemma Fri&s;ius. <HI>40.</HI></BIBL></Q>
<P>BY the Sun you may doe it any houre, fir&s;t getting the azimuth by the 6. and then lay the rule to the lyke degree Ea&s;twards, or VVe&s;twards on the <HI>Limbe,</HI> as the Sunne &s;hall then be, and the rule there fixed, lay the <HI>Iewell</HI> flat on a &s;toole, or by &s;ome deui&s;e leuell with the horizon, and turne him about till the Sunne &s;hine through both the &s;ight holes, and then will the noone line of the <HI>Iewell,</HI> lye euen in the Meridian, by which you may draw your line, but here had you neede of a wyre &s;et vp plumme in the furthermo&s;t &s;ight hole, and &s;o lette his &s;hade couer the other, becau&s;e the Sunne beyng aloft cannot pearce the &s;ightes, as in the &s;euenth is &s;aid.</P>
<P>Another way. Erect a &s;tile or wyre plum on any horizontall plaine in the forenoone, and hang the <HI>Iewell</HI> that the Sunne pearce the &s;ight holes, and marke both what deg. the rule cutteth in the <HI>Limbe,</HI> and where the &s;hade of the top of the &s;tyle endeth on the plaine, and there &s;et a pricke, let the <HI>Iewell</HI> hang &s;till, till the Sun in the after noone pearce agayne the &s;ights, then &s;et another pricke where the &s;tiles &s;hade endeth, then fro~ the &s;tile draw a line iu&s;t betweene tho&s;e prickes, the &s;ame is the Meridian, and cro&s;&s;e the &s;ame &s;quare with a|nother, and that &s;heweth Ea&s;t and VVe&s;t.</P>
<P>Another way. Make a conuenient circle on a plain in the centre, &s;tick a &s;tile plum, marke both in the fore|noone and after noone, where the &s;tiles &s;hade toucheth that circle, then draw a lyne from the centre to the midde&s;t of that arche betweene the touches, the &s;ame is the Meridian.</P>
<P>Another. The A&s;trolabe placed on an horizontall plaine, as before, and the Sunne &s;hining, at Sunne ry|&s;ing, and likewi&s;e at sunne &s;etting through the &s;ight holes, the degree betweene both, &s;heweth the Meridian line.</P>
<P>Another. Get the amplitude of the Sun by the 19. chap. number it on the <HI>Limbe</HI> from the noone line, and therto lay the rule and the <HI>Iewel</HI> leuel with the horizon, marke at Sun ri&s;ing, that the beames pearce the &s;ights and then is the noone line your de&s;ire.</P>
<P><HI>Blagraue,</HI> Though Gemma Fri&s;ius hath &s;et downe wayes inough to find the Meridian, yet all of them de|pend vpon the &s;hining of the Sun, and in the day time. Therefore I wil &s;hew two other wayes in the night, by the &s;tarrs, nothing inferior to the other. For, in like maner as you did the fir&s;t way by the Sun, may you do by any &s;tarre hauing gotten his azimuth by his houre di&s;tance from the South by the 26. or 32. the deg. of the azimuth, reckoned on the <HI>Limbe,</HI> and the rule fixed therto, laying the <HI>Iewel</HI> flatte, as before in the Sun, turne him til you may &s;ee the &s;tarre, euen with the &s;ightes which here had neede be wyres both.</P>
<P>The &s;econd way is that which I v&s;ed, before I knew any other almo&s;t to &s;et dyalles by, and in my opinion is nothing inferior to anye of tho&s;e before. Thus woulde I do whe~ I had made my horizontal dial, &amp; &s;odered on the cocke or <HI>Gnomon,</HI> I wold choo&s;e a bright &s;tarry night, &amp; then bring forth my dial, &amp; &s;et him on the po&s;t where he &s;hould &s;tand, then had I a playne &s;quare little boorde, or rather then fayle, a fayre &s;quare trencher, this &s;quare boord would I fa&s;ten or hold perpendiculer, clo&s;e to the cocke, and &s;o turne about cocke, dyall, boorde and all together, till I might &s;ee the la&s;t &s;tarre of the tayle of <HI>Vr&s;a minor,</HI> which they commonly cal the pole &s;tarre, euen with the boord, and then was I &s;ure the cocke &s;tood North and South, and &s;o would I naile my dyal on.</P>
<P>But in this way you mu&s;t not neglect two things, one is that the boord &s;tand plumme vp with the cocke, at the time of view. The other which truely in tho&s;e dayes I tooke no regard vnto, becau&s;e I knew it not, for I could make dyalles before I &s;tudied A&s;tronomy: and that is this: you mu&s;t by helpe of your <HI>Iewel,</HI> choo&s;e your time, &s;o that the beginning of &Aries;, or &Libra;, be in, or neere the meridian either aboue or vnder the earth. For

<P><HI>Blagraue.</HI> VVherefore I will &s;hew an example, whiche I my &s;elfe for mine owne delight and experience did ob&s;erue. The nienth of October 1580 walking foorth at night, as I commonly dyd, to behold the con|&s;tellations, I perceiued Southwardes a &s;himering or dimme light, in bigne&s;&s;e to &s;ight, about an hand breadth, but becau&s;e the skyes were cloudie, I coulde not well iudge wheather it were a Comet or &s;ome &s;tarre, with his light di&s;sipated by the clowdes. The tenth of of October, being a cleere &s;tarry night, I perceiued wel that it was a Comette, or rather of &s;ome called a crinitall &s;tarre: it was then placed vnder the three &s;tarres of the <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> light, called <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> to fight about two yardes, &s;o that it made an equicrurall trian|gle, with the two vttermo&s;t of tho&s;e three &s;tarres. The eleuenth of October, the nyghte was cloudie and no &s;tarres &s;eene: the twelfth of October, a cleere &s;tarrie night againe, and then I &s;awe the Comet was gotten aboue the &s;aide &s;tarres about an ell to &s;ight, and there made an equicrurall triangle, with the midlemo&s;t of the &s;ame three &s;tarres and the vtter &s;tarre VVe&s;twardes, wherefore &s;eeynge I was too wryte this Chapter: &s;hortlye after &s;eeynge the skyes &s;o deere, I thought good too take a little paynes for that cau&s;e.</P>
<P>But hauinge on that &s;odaine no meridian readie founde, neither my A&s;trolabe furni&s;hed wyth wyer &s;ights, nor placed as in the 33. and 34. to get the Azumuth, I pre&s;ently deui&s;ed by help of two long poles, &s;et &s;omewhat a &s;lope, vnderteeled wyth two forkes, too hang from the toppes of eache of them a corde with a plummet pitching them too and fro, tyll at the la&s;t &s;tanding South from them a pretie way off, I might &s;ee the pole &s;tar euen with both the cordes, which deui&s;e here &s;erued me in &s;teed of a meridian line, for then I went on the North &s;ide of the cordes, and watched tyll the Comet came euen with them: whiche hap|pened pre&s;ently after I was readie for him: then was I &s;ure that he was in the meridian or South azimuth, which done, I pre&s;ently tooke the height of the Comet 38 &frac12;. deg. al&s;o of the great &s;tar called Aldebura<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="2 letters">, the bulles eye, by whiche according to the 26. I founde it eyght of the clocke the &s;unne then beeing in the 29. degree, 10. minutes of &Libra;.</P>
<P>Nowe becau&s;e the Comets height, videlicet, 38 &frac12;. was equall in manner to the Equinoctials height by the 7. I concluded his declination was 0. videlicet, in the Equinoctiall it &s;elfe, and by the 29. his degree of culmination 24 &frac12;. degree of &Aquar;, and by the 10. his right a&s;cen&s;ion 327. And then hauing his right a&s;cen&s;i|on and declination, I &s;eeke them out on the <HI>Mater</HI> by the 17. and marked where they cro&s;&s;e, and there make a pricke with ynke, for it was the Comets place at the time of my ob&s;eruation. La&s;tly, I turned the <HI>finitor</HI> to the Eclipticke, and there by the &s;euenteenth chapter, the azimuth cutting the pricke or place of the Comet, &s;hewed his longitude 329. and better, whiche more plainelier is the 29 degree of &Aquar;, and the Al|micantare cutting the &s;ame pricke &s;hewed me 12 &frac23;. degree, the latitude of the Comet Northwardes from the Eclipticke. By this chapter and the 17. a man might make a globe, with his con&s;tellations truer then &s;ome are that are &s;olde.</P>
<P>Note that I &s;awe the &s;ame Comet or crinitall &s;tarre, about the Ea&s;t circle, and about 12 degrees high as neere as I coulde ge&s;&s;e vpon the &s;ixe and twentie day of Nouember next following, for in truth, his proper motion was a mayne towardes the Sunne, though wandering, and then the Sunnes motion being towardes it, they had met and pa&s;&s;ed by eche other.</P>

<HEAD><HI>Chapter. 40.</HI> Howe to knowe the quantitie of the angles which the Eclipticke maketh with the meridian at any moment.</HEAD>
<Q><BIBL>Gemma Fri&s;ius <HI>48.</HI></BIBL></Q>
<P>IT hath been &s;hewed before that theclipticke doth alwayes diuer&s;ly or vnequally pa&s;&s;e ouer as well a ryght horrizon or the meridian of any place, as the oblique horrizon, yet wyth a more diuer&s;itie and vnlikene&s;&s;e in the la&s;t, then in the fir&s;t. The cau&s;e (as it hath been &s;aide) is the deformitie of the angles or inclinations of the Eclipticke to the meridian. The determination of this chapter therefore is to teache how too knowe this inclination, which is very commodious in many re&s;pectes as &s;hall bee &s;hewed in their place.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t you mu&s;t vnder&s;tande that as oft as two great circles deuide, or cro&s;&s;e one another, they make either 4. right angles, or els 4. angles equall vnto foure right angles. Further the 2. oppo&s;ite angles, at eyther point of the inter&s;ection are alwayes equal which in the Theoremes before my &s;pericall triangle is manife&s;ted. VVherefore one of them beeynge knowen, all the re&s;te are knowen lykewi&s;e, for doubling the angle, known, &amp; then taking that out of 360, degrees, which is the quantitie of foure right angles, there remaineth the other two angles, the halfe thereof is one of them: as too the purpo&s;e, when &Cancer; is in the meridian, all the foure angles are right angle when &Aries; or &Libra; is there, then the twoo le&s;&s;er angles are alwayes equall to the complement of the Sunnes greate&s;t declination: the other twoo, then are ea&s;ily knowen as before. Know al&s;o that the degrees of the Eclipticke alike di&s;tante from eyther of the Equinoctial points, do make like angles of inclination, but in &s;undry partes of the heauen. In this Chapter &s;halbe &s;hewed to find the two le&s;&s;er angles.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t therefore by the 29. learne the degree of culmination (that is the degree of the Ecliptick) in which you de&s;ire to learne the angles that he maketh with the meridian, then marke howe farre this degree is di&s;tant from the next Equinoctiall point: the like di&s;tance number on the artike circle from the poynt
<PB N="42" REF="31"> where it toucheth the meridian or <HI>limbe:</HI> for at the ende of this reckoning mu&s;t needes bee the pole of the Zodiacke when &Aries; or &Libra; is in the meridian. Then applying the rule to the &s;ame poynt in the pole circle, it &s;heweth on the <HI>limbe</HI> the le&s;&s;er angle &s;ought for, if you reckon from the Equinoctiall to the rule.</P>

<P>For example, I would knowe the angles which the 6 &frac13;. of &Capri; maketh with the meridian, the di&s;taunce thereof from &Aries; is 82 &frac23;. the right a&s;cention of that di&s;taunce from &Aries;, by the 10. chapter, is 81 &frac23;.

I turn about the rule tyll the 82-&frac23;. degrees thereof doe cut the 81 &frac23;. parallell, and then doth the rule in the <HI>Limbe</HI> &s;hew 87. deg. the quantitie of the le&s;&s;er angle.</P>

<P>THE powers of the planets and &s;tarres, as thy differ in re&s;pect of their nature, &s;o are they either increa|&s;ed or decrea&s;ed according to their cituation in the heauens. For we &s;ee dayly that tempe&s;tes are chief|ly eyther rai&s;ed or &s;tayed by the Sunnes ri&s;ing, &s;etting or comming to the meridian, &amp; that the moone by commyng to tho&s;e foure place, doth rule the ebbyng and flowing of the Seas, and &s;ometimes ray&s;e tem|pe&s;ts. Be&s;ides that, he that wyll marke it well &s;hall finde, that the ri&s;ing and &s;ettyng, and comming to the meridian, of the great &s;tarres, and &s;pecially with the Sunne, as in the 25. woorketh great effects in altering the ayre.</P>
<P>And therefore olde writers called the&s;e 4. places, the Cardines, and other newer call the angles or points, of the 4. Cardines or angles. Ptolomeus appointeth the midheauen to be chiefe and &s;ignifieth glory and honour. The next too bee the a&s;cendent, and &s;ignifieth life. Then the de&s;cendent, and &s;ignifieth deathe.

<P>But nowe to the matter againe: the horo&s;cope or a&s;cendent is the degree of the eclipticke ry&s;yng vppon the horrizon at any time propo&s;ed, or in the beginning of any thing, and chiefly in the natiuitie of a man, and is very ea&s;ily founde by helpe of the <HI>Reete</HI> thus.</P>

<P>Admit a childe were borne the 12. of October 1580. at eight of the clocke at night in our latitude, and that you woulde knowe the a&s;cendent of this natiuitie. The Sun was then in the 29. degree 10. minutes of &Libra;, whiche degree, lay vnto eight. of the clocke among the afternoone houres in the <HI>limbe,</HI> and then looke vnto the 51 &frac23;. horrizon what degree cutteth him on the Ea&s;t part, I finde the 1. degree of &Cancer;, whiche is the a&s;cendent. In this example the North halfe of the Zodiacke cro&s;&s;eth both the North and the South parts of the horrizon, but becau&s;e it is not the North halfe of the Zodiacke that ri&s;eth on the horrizon, therfore you mu&s;t take the degree which lyeth on the Northea&s;t part of the horrizon, which is as I &s;aye, 1. degree of &Cancer;. For on the South part of the horrizon, there lieth the 10. degree of &Taurus;. whiche is not too bee accounted of. But to proceede further in the example you may al&s;o (the degree of the Sunne &s;tanding at eight of the clocke as before) &s;ee the fir&s;t degree of &Capri;, in the VVe&s;t parte of the horrizon de&s;cendente, where al&s;o the South halfe or the Zodiacke lyeth cro&s;&s;e both halfes of the horri&s;on, &s;o that the tenth degree of &Scorp;. cutteth the North parte of the horri&s;on, whiche mu&s;te bee refu&s;ed, remembrynge alwayes that the North halfe

<P>ANtiquitie which ought to be imbraced, hath appointed 12. hou&s;es or places, wherein the &s;tarres &amp; pla|nets haue great powers, of which 12. the 4. angles or <HI>cardines</HI> are chiefe&s;t. For euen as the Suns recour&s;e doth not only alter the yeere beyng in the two equinoctiall points and &s;ol&s;tices, but al&s;o in euery of the 12. &s;ignes, which cau&s;eth euery moneth to differ from other: euen &s;o rea&s;on and experience teacheth in di|&s;tingui&s;hyng the 12. hou&s;es. But now all writers agree in &s;etting out the 4. <HI>cardines,</HI> and greatly di&s;agree in the other 8. For &s;ome beginning from the a&s;cendent, deuide the Zodiacke into 12. equall partes by circles meetyng together at the poles of the Zodiacke, and to the&s;e doth Ptolomeus agree, Other &s;ome deuide the equinoctiall by circles from the poles of the world into 12. equall partes, as Alkabitius, &amp; Iohannes de Sax|onia. Other&s;ome (which in deed is the be&s;t) according to Regiomontanus, deuide the equinoctiall into 12. equall parts, by circles meeting together at the two inter&s;ections of the meridian with the horrizon, and this way &s;ayth he, &s;tandeth with mo&s;t rea&s;on, &s;ince they are di&s;tingui&s;hed by circles, like vnto tho&s;e which appoint the 4. <HI>cardines,</HI> and meeting together with them at the &s;ame points. A fourth way did Campanus a famous mathematician appointe, deuiding the verticall circle of the Ea&s;t into twelue equall partes from the &s;aid in|ter&s;ection of the meridian with the horrizon. VVel, how&s;oeuer the hou&s;es bee deuided, tho&s;e circles which di&s;tingui&s;h them, or rather &s;emicircles (for twelue &s;emicircles do perfourme it) are called circles of po&s;ition and the like &s;emicircles may bee drawen by anye &s;tarre, degree or poynt of the heauen, and are called al&s;o circles of po&s;ition. Therefore in &s;hort, a circle of po&s;ition according too <HI>Io. Regiomontanus,</HI> whome wee meane to followe, for that all menne nowe doe &s;o, is a &s;eemicircle pa&s;sing from the twoo inter&s;ections of

<P>But nowe for the order of the 12. hou&s;es, therein they all agree. The fir&s;t hou&s;e beginneth in the a&s;cen|dent, and &s;o proceedeth vnder the earth, and the re&s;t in order by the <HI>Imum coeli</HI> vntoo the de&s;cendent, and thence by the <HI>medium coeli</HI> vnto the a&s;cendent againe, where the 12. hou&s;es end. Euerye hou&s;e hath 25. de|grees forwardes, and fiue degrees of the hou&s;e that went before.

Two of tho&s;e &s;ixe are the horizon and the meridian which limit out the foure angles, the other 4. are two of ech &s;ide alike di&s;tant from the meridian, bending to|wards the horizon alike, and haue like equations ech to his match, and ech of them boundeth two hou&s;es. So that euen as the meridian doth bound the midde heauen, and angle of the earth, &s;o doth the circle of po&s;i+tion next the meridian on thea&s;t part, appoint the 11. and 3. hou&s;es, the &s;econd next the horizon, the 12. &amp; 2. likewi&s;e two circles on the we&s;t part, &s;heweth the other foure hou&s;es.

Therefore 4. hou&s;es knowne with the Horo&s;cope and midheauen, there needeth no more for this turne: &amp; tho&s;e 4. are knowne if the two circles of po&s;ition of the 12. hou&s;es, which al&s;o is of the 2. &amp; of the 11. which al&s;o is of the 3. be knowne by their depre&s;sions vnder the pole in this manner.</P>
<P>Place the zenith line to the latitude as in the la&s;t Chapt. and then marke what azimuth cutteth euery 30. deg. of thequinoctiall line, the &s;ame is the circle of po&s;ition of euery &s;uch hou&s;e, to which get the eleuation of the pole by the la&s;t Chap.

<P>Some haue had a delight to place diuer&s;e of the great &s;tars in the figure being &s;et, which mu&s;t thus be done.

The meridian is alwayes the beginning of the 10. hou&s;e, wherfore &s;o many times 30. as the &s;tars circle of po&s;ition is di&s;tant from the meridian on thequinoct. line, &s;o many hou&s;es it lacketh, or is beyond the 10. hou&s;e: &s;o that by knowing in which quarter of the skie the &s;tar is, the hou&s;e, &amp; part is ea&s;ily reckoned.</P>
<P><HI>Blagraue.</HI> He that vnder&s;tandeth al before, needeth no example here, but thus much farther, I wil &s;hew you as in the 45. you may plainly &s;ee that 4. circles of po&s;ition with the <HI>Finitor,</HI> &amp; the meridian, do &s;hew the whole 12. hou&s;es, which are as there is &s;aid, the 47. and 19 &frac34; azimuthes or circles of po&s;ition, reckoned on ech &s;ide of the zenith line as he is there placed: wherefore if you did di&s;&s;euer out with &s;ome di&s;tinction by prickes or o|therwi&s;e tho&s;e 4. azimuthes, and &s;et their figures to them, namely at the zenith line, 1. becau&s;e hee being the horizon beginneth the 1. hou&s;e at the 19 &frac34; azimuth vnder him: or leftwards two, for the 2. hou&s;e: at the 47. azi|muth 3. at the 90. which is the <HI>Limb.</HI> 4. and &s;o round backe againe by the &s;ame circles ending at 12. in the 19 &frac34; azimuth aboue the zenith line. The&s;e circles being thus di&s;tinct &amp; numbered, are in truth your 12. hou&s;es, the zenith line being at the latitude. So that now the &s;tar or &s;unnes di&s;tance from the meridian reckoned on their

<P>TO direct &s;aith Io.

Fri&s;ius <HI>Dimi&s;sion,</HI> or <HI>Emi&s;sion,</HI> becau&s;e one place of the heauens by turning of the &s;phere is emi&s;ed or &s;ent forth vnto the &s;ite of another place. Whereby Ptolomeus doth call tho&s;e places which hee termeth chiefe, that is to &s;ay, tho&s;e which may receiue, the chiefe &s;ignifiers of our life, and adde power to tho&s;e &s;ignifiers <HI>Topous Apheticous:</HI> and al&s;o calleth tho&s;e &s;ignifiers <HI>Aphetae,</HI> as it were Dimi&s;&s;aries, or Emi&s;&s;aries. The Arabians call them <HI>Hylech Plilippus,</HI> prorogators. To be &s;hort, <HI>Apheta</HI> called commonly both in latin &amp; engli&s;h, <HI>Significator,</HI> or &s;ignifier, is either a &s;tar, or &s;ome notable place in the heauens, hauing the chiefe&s;t dominion ouer the life of man, and Ptolomeus hath 4. almo&s;t, the Sun, Moone, the pars Fortune, &amp; the Horo&s;cope. There be other pla|ces al&s;o accepted of authors, as the midheauen, and any planet hauing gotten &s;ome notable dominion: and are called <HI>Apheta</HI> and &s;ignifiers, vnto whom other place of the planets, or places filled with the beames of planets are dimi&s;ed or &s;ent, that is to &s;ay, dyrected.</P>
<P>For declaration hereof, take G. F. own example of the natiuity of King Philip, &s;omtime hu&s;band to Queene Marie. He was born 1527. at a quart. pa&s;t 4. of the cloke in the afternoone, the &s;un being 9. deg. in &Gemini;, &amp; the lat. of the country being 40. The figure thereof being &s;et there, is found 2 &frac12; deg. of &Scorp; in the a&s;cendent, and in the midheauen 8 &frac12; deg. of &Leo;. And now to the purpo&s;e, the Horo&s;cope is alwayes a notable place. For hence do they take their iudgement of the helth of the body, of life and of iourneying, wherefore it is called <HI>Apheta,</HI> or a &s;ignifier. And Mars which then was in the 2. hou&s;e, is called the promi&s;er, &amp; the 2. place, which by the mo|tion of the &s;phere is brought vnto the fir&s;t place, that is to &s;ay, vnto the horizon which is the circle of po&s;ition of the horo&s;cope, &amp; this is called direction or emi&s;sion. The que&s;tion is chiefly how many deg. of thequinoct. &s;hall pa&s;&s;e ouer the circle of the horizon or the meridian, in the meane time, while the place of &Mars; be brought vnto the place of the <HI>Apheta.</HI> For it is &s;ignified that there are &s;o many yeres to come before the effect of the pro|mi&s;er &s;halbe performed on the <HI>Apheta.</HI> This matter is ea&s;ily done by the <HI>Iewel</HI> for any region or point of the heauens. Seeke the circle of po&s;ition of the fir&s;t place or &s;ignifier, and his horizon by the 44. and 45. or rather 47. and vpon the &s;ame horizon lay the deg. of the <HI>Apheta</HI> in the zodiacke, and marke then what deg. is in the midheauen. And then turne about the <HI>Reete</HI> vntil the 2. place of the promi&s;er come to the &s;ame horizon of the &s;ignifier, by and by moue the rule vnto the deg. which before was in the midheauen, it &s;heweth on the <HI>Limbe</HI> the degrees pa&s;&s;ed of thequinoctiall, which &s;ignifie the yeares of the direction.</P>
<P>As in the &s;aid example, place the Horo&s;cope being the &s;ignifier of life vnto his circle of po&s;ition, that is, vnto the 40 horizon, you &s;hal &s;ee on the line of midheauen &Leo; 8 &frac12; deg. then turning the <HI>Reete</HI> vntill the place of &Mars; which then after Alphon&s;us, was in the 29. deg. 17. min. of &Scorp; be brought vnto the &s;ame 40 horizon, and then &s;etting the rule vnto the 8. deg. 30. min of &Leo;, you may &s;ee that the <HI>Reete</HI> hath gon forwards on the <HI>Limbe</HI> 34. deg. &frac16; almo&s;t, and &s;o many are the deg. of emi&s;sion or direction of &Mars; vnto the horizon. But heere mu&s;t you diligently note that for Aphetaes placed in thea&s;t halfe of the heauens, that the horizons be taken on thea&s;t part of the <HI>Iewel,</HI> &amp; for tho&s;e of the we&s;t halfe, on the the we&s;t part, the re&s;t may be performed as before. Nei|ther mu&s;t you here neglect the latitudes and declinations of the planets, for which I taught you remedie in my addition to the 23. Chapt. And here another way to remedie the latitude of any planet, is thus: Get the deg. of right a&s;cen. and thereto lay the rule, whereon reckon his declination from the <HI>Limbe</HI> inwards &amp; there is the true place of the planet: this rule al&s;o &s;erueth for all &s;tars not being in the <HI>Reete,</HI> and al&s;o for &s;tarres in the <HI>Reete</HI> in workings for time long pa&s;&s;ed or to come, becau&s;e fixed &s;tarres go forwards in long. a deg. at the lea&s;t, in an. 100. yeares.</P>

<P>WHen as the &s;ignifier is on thea&s;t part Ptolomeus, always emi&s;eth or bringeth the 2. place vnto the fir&s;t circle or place, or to the Aphetaes place, &amp; reckoneth the deg. pa&s;t in the meane time.

<P>IT hath beene plainely and exqui&s;itely &s;hewed in what time the Dymi&s;sion or direction of any place is per|formed. But oftentimes the que&s;tion is before al the Dymi&s;sion be performed, into what deg. of the zodiack the direction &s;hall come, and he that hath wel vnder&s;tood the premi&s;es, &s;hal performe this Chapt. with lit|tle adoe: for the que&s;tion it &s;elfe hath a certaine difficultie by the manner of pronuntiation, which I thinke be&s;t fir&s;t to expound, for many either pronounce ill, or el&s;e vnder&s;tand not the matter wel: for whe~ as we &s;ay, how farre commeth the direction of the Hori&s;cope this yeare. It &s;eemeth to be vnder&s;toode that the Horo|&s;cope (which now we cal the <HI>Apheta</HI>) &s;hould be moued in the heauens: but the matter is otherwi&s;e when the <HI>Apheta</HI> is in thea&s;t part. For then we do not emit or &s;end forth the Horo&s;cope, or any <HI>Apheta,</HI> but do mooue the places following, or promi&s;ers vnto him. Therefore when it is demaunded how farre the emi&s;sion of the <HI>Apheta</HI> placed on thea&s;t part, hath gone forwards: the que&s;tion is, what deg. of the zodiacke &s;hal come vnto the &s;emicircle of the <HI>Apheta</HI> in this or that yeare. But the <HI>Apheta</HI> &s;tanding on the We&s;t part: It is more right|ly &s;aid that his Dymi&s;sion doth occupie this or that deg. of theclipticke, becau&s;e the <HI>Apheta</HI> is knowne to be moued towards the We&s;t. Now therefore togither with an example will we explaine the matter.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t in direct direction. Therefore in the natiuitie of king Philip, let vs appoint the <HI>Apheta</HI> to be the Horo|&s;cope it &s;elfe, let vs &s;ee then vnto what degree of the zodiacke the Dymi&s;sion, or direction &s;hall come that yeare 1554, that is to &s;ay, what part of the zodiack &s;hal then come vnto the Horizon circle by Dymi&s;sion vid. vnto the <HI>Aphetaes</HI> place. Fir&s;t con&s;ider how many yeares be pa&s;&s;ed from the natiuitie it &s;elfe, which are 27. for he was born, anno 1527. Secondly, place the <HI>Apheta</HI> vnto his place, which is the Horizon, &amp; note the deg. of culmination, then remoue the &s;ame deg. of culmination 27. degrees forwards in the <HI>Limbe,</HI> and there &s;hall appeare in the 40. horizon &Scorp; 23. deg. 40. minutes almo&s;t, therefore this deg. of the zodiacke then commeth vnto the Horo&s;cope.</P>
<P>But now let the <HI>Apheta</HI> be in the we&s;t part of the heauens, as the part of Fortune is in the &s;aid natiuitie, let vs &s;eeke his Dimi&s;sion for the &s;ame yeare 1554. place the deg. of Culmination in the midheauen videl. &Leo;, 8. deg. 30. minutes: and numbering thence 27. deg. in the <HI>Limbe,</HI> and thereto laying the rule, place there the degree of Culmin, videl. the 8 &frac12; of &Leo;. Now then marke diligently the di&s;tance of the part of Fortune from the &s;outh, numbering the degree of the <HI>Limb</HI> betweene the nooneline and the rule placed on the part of For|tune. In our example they are 45. deg. 45. minutes almo&s;t, with the di&s;tance therefore, and the declination of the <HI>Apheta</HI> found before videl. 22. deg. 25. minutes north, &s;eeke the circle of po&s;ition of the &s;ame <HI>Apheta</HI> for that time, and theleuation to it, and how many degrees of thequinoctiall the &s;ame &s;emicircle is di&s;tant from the meridian. Therefore by the 44. or 47. Chapt. the circle of po&s;ition is found di&s;tant from the meridian in thea&s;t circle 41. deg. 48. minut. Theleuation of the pole is 25. 40. The &s;ame &s;emicircle doth cutte off from the we&s;t quadrant of thequinoctiall 34 deg. 30. minutes as neere as may be gathered by a &s;mall in&s;trument. Now therefore we haue the circle of po&s;ition of the part of Fortune for 27. yeares pa&s;&s;ed, the que&s;tion now is, what deg. of theclipticke was in this circle of po&s;ition in the beginning of this natiuitie. For it may right|ly be &s;aid that the Dymi&s;sion or direction of the part of Fortune is come vnto it. But &s;eeing this is a generall rule, it is better to &s;hew it in a Chap. following.</P>

<Q><BIBL>Gemma Fri&s;ius. <HI>62.</HI></BIBL></Q>
<P>THis chap. is very profitable about the occultations and appearing of &s;tarres, and al&s;o for the deforma|tion of Eclip&s;es. Fir&s;t therefore place the deg. propo&s;ed vnto the horizon on the Ea&s;t, then reckon the de|grees of the Eclipticke betweene the a&s;cendent and midheauen, if they exceede 90. then take the deg. betweene the midheauen, and the de&s;cendent, or take the fir&s;t out of 180. all is one: next get the meridian al|titude of the degrees of midheauen. The&s;e had, reckon on the rule that di&s;taunce betweene the horizon and mydheauen outwards from the centre, and moue the rule vp and downe till the &s;ame poynt do cut the pa|rallel an&s;werable to the height of midheauen, and &s;o doth the rule &s;hew in the <HI>Limbe,</HI> reckoning from the E|quinoctiall the quantity of the angle &s;ought for: which is al&s;o the le&s;&s;er angle, as in the 39. and therfore &s;ub|ducted out of 180. leaueth the greater, and this le&s;&s;er angle is alwaies the height of the Ecliptickes 90. deg. or <HI>nonage&s;s. gradus</HI> from the horizon.</P>
<P>Example. In the yere of our Lord 1590. the 20. of Iuly the 19. houre 30. min. which is at halfe an houre pa&s;t 7. the next morning (for A&s;tronomers begin the day at noone, and reckon agayne til noone vnto 24. in their tables) there &s;hall be a great Eclip&s;e of the Sun, the Sun and moone both being in coniunction in the 7 &frac12;. deg. of &Leo;: wherefore placing the deg. of the &s;un vnto 7. &frac12;. of the clocke 30. min. I &s;ee 10. &frac23;. of &Virgo; in the a&s;cendent, and in the de&s;cendent 10 &frac23;. of &Pisces;, and in the mydheauen 4. &Gemini;, I would now know the quan|tytie of the le&s;&s;er angle made betweene the Eclipticke and the horizon. From the a&s;cendent to the mydhea|uen, are 96 &frac23;. deg. take tho&s;e out of 180. there re&s;teth 83. &frac13;. the meridian altitude of the degree of culminati|on, vz. of 4. of &Gemini;, by the 28. is 59. &frac12;. deg. This done, reckon the degrees betweene the midheauen and the de&s;|cendent, vz. 83 &frac13;. on the rule from the centre, and lay the &s;ame degree on the 59 &frac12;. parallel, &amp; &s;o doeth the rule &s;hew in the <HI>Limbe,</HI> reckoning from the Equinoctiall 60. deg. the quantity of the angle &s;ought for, which is the height of the <HI>nonage&s;. grad.</HI> or 90. deg. of the Eclipticke aboue the horizon.</P>
<P>By this angle many things are brought about, as &s;halbe touched hereafter.</P>
<P><HI>Blagraue.</HI> It may be that Gemma Fri&s;ius tooke the cour&s;e before about this chap. for better vnder&s;tanding of the chap. following, or els I mu&s;t &s;ay hee ouerclipt another more ea&s;ie way, as hee him&s;elfe &s;aieth, learned men do many times, which I wil here &s;hew you.</P>
<P>Place the deg. at which you require the angle, to be a&s;cendent: thence reckon vpwards 20. deg. on the Zo|diacke, therto lay the rule, which &s;heweth in the <HI>Limbe</HI> the di&s;tance of that 90. deg. from the South by the 30. and betweene the <HI>Limbe</HI> and this 90. deg. of the Zodiacke, rckoning on the rule, is the declination thereof by my addition to the 4. chapter. The&s;e had, &s;eeke on the <HI>Mater</HI> where this declination and di&s;taunced do cro&s;&s;e by the 26. and the Almicantare (the <HI>Finitor</HI> beyng at the latitude) cutting there, &s;heweth the angle &s;ought for.</P>
<P>As in example before, the 10 &frac23;. of &Virgo;, being a&s;cendent, I reckon on the Zodiacke vpwards 90. deg. it ligh|teth on the 10 &frac23; of &Gemini;, thereto I lay the rule, where I finde the di&s;tance of the &s;ame 10 &frac23;. of &Gemini;, from the &s;outh to be 7. deg. &frac14;. and his declination by reckoning the deg. on the rule betweene it and the <HI>Limbe,</HI> to be 22. and better, North. The&s;e two being had, I &s;et the <HI>Finitor</HI> to the latitude, and then marke where the 7 &frac14;. houre line reckoned from the <HI>Limbe,</HI> and the 22. parallel do cro&s;&s;e, and there I &s;ee cutteth the 60. almicantare, as before, the angle &s;ought for, with le&s;&s;e trouble.</P>

<P>THe houre giuen, with the Sunnes place: the a&s;cendent is knowen by the 41. and by the 52. the altitude of the <HI>nonag. grad.</HI> or 90. degrees from the horizon, which I reckon of the <HI>Limbe</HI> on the <HI>Reete,</HI> and thereto lay the labell: this done, note how many degrees the Sun, or point giuen, is from the a&s;cendent or de&s;ce~|dent, &s;o many deg. reckon on the rule from the centre, where the Almicantare cutting, &s;heweth the altitude &s;ought for.</P>

<P>THis chap, &s;erueth chiefly to delay the &s;unnes Eclip&s;es, wherein is almo&s;t the greate&s;t labour and diffy|culty of A&s;tronomie and Arithmeticke but &s;hal be ea&s;ily performed by helpe of this <HI>Iewel.</HI> Fir&s;t note that Gemma Fri&s;ius meaneth by the circle of altitude, the vertical circle or azimuth, wherein the &s;un or any other deg. propo&s;ed, is. Then to proceede, gette the di&s;taunce of the point propo&s;ed from the zenith, by &s;ub|ducting his height learned by the la&s;t chap. out of 90. Likewi&s;e learne by the 52. the di&s;tance of the <HI>nonage&s;t. grad.</HI> or 90. deg. the Eclipt. from the zenith: the&s;e 2. being known, reckon the greater of the&s;e on the rule from the centre, &amp; then moue that note on the rule vnto the paral. of the le&s;&s;er di&s;tance, and &s;o doth the rule &s;hew in the <HI>Limbe</HI> the quantity of the angle, reckoning from the Equinoc. As if in the la&s;t que&s;tion of the E|clip&s;e, I wold know of the angle which the circle of altitude pas&s;ing by the Sun, doth make with the Eclipt. I &s;eeke the di&s;taunce of the Sun from the zenith, by &s;ubducting 28 &frac13;. from 90. 61 &frac23;. Likewi&s;e &s;ubducting the height of the 90. deg. vz. 60. from 90. there re&s;teth 30. his di&s;taunce from the zenith al&s;o. Now doe I reckon on the rule 61 &frac23;. deg. and there make a note which I lay vnto the 30. parallell, and &s;o is the angle &s;ought for found to be 34 &frac12;. &s;hewed on the <HI>Limbe</HI> by the rule.</P>
<P>This is alwaies one of the le&s;&s;er angles, as in the 39. chapter, and is towardes the Ea&s;t, when the poynt of the Eclipticke a&s;signed, is on the Ea&s;t part of his 90. degree, and on the VVe&s;t if otherwi&s;e. Wherefore this angle found, vz. 34. &frac12;. &s;ubducted out 180. there re&s;teth 145 &frac12;. the qu~atity of the gteater angle as in the 39.</P>
<P>Furthermore know this for a certain truth, that the angle found in this chap. is that which they cal the an|gle of latitude, becau&s;e the parallaxis or diuer&s;ity of a&s;pect, which happeneth in latitude is &s;ubtended or ly|eth vnder it, and this angle if we &s;ubduct him out of 90. there &s;hall bee le&s;t the angle which they call the an|gle of longitude: but whereto the&s;e belong, and to what v&s;e they are &s;ought, &s;hall bee &s;hewed here following.</P>
<P><HI>Blagraue.</HI> In this chap. the Equinoctiall repre&s;enteth the Ecliptick, and the rule, the vertical circle of the &s;un, the poynt noted in the rule the zenith, or rather the like di&s;taunce from the Sunne: the other way or down|wards the centre of the <HI>Iewell</HI> repre&s;enteth the point of inter&s;ection with the &s;unne: the line between the note in the rule (which as I &s;aide is the zenith) and the Equinoctial, is the di&s;tance betweene the zenith, and the 90. deg. but rather between the like deg. on the azimuth beneath the &s;un. The rea&s;ons hereof I will &s;hew &s;ome|what more large in my 5. booke, and omit them here, both becau&s;e too much tedious matter together might cloy a young &s;tudent, and al&s;o for that I meane to &s;hew, how to find al &s;pherical triangles on the <HI>Iewel,</HI> which Gemma Fri&s;ius in&s;trument could neuer doe.</P>

<HEAD><HI>Chapter 56</HI> How to finde the parallaxis or diuer&s;ity of the &s;ight of the moone in the circle of altitude.</HEAD>
<Q><BIBL>Gemma Fri&s;ius. <HI>65.</HI></BIBL></Q>
<P>IT is by demon&s;tration affirmed in Ptolomeus works &amp; other famous authors, that the globe of the earth is but a point in re&s;pect of the heauen it &s;elfe: that is to &s;ay an vn&s;en&s;ible bigne&s;&s;e in compari&s;on to the hea|uens. And that whether a man be in the centre of the earth, or on the circumference, there commeth ther|by no diuer&s;ity of any apparents in the heauens: heereof it commeth that all dialles are made, as though we dwelt in the centre of the worlde, neyther hath any man found diuer&s;ity therein, were he neuer &s;o ingeni|ous or practick. But as the&s;e things are mo&s;t true, and &s;tand vpon good demon&s;tration, yet in &s;ome of the pla|nets it is not &s;o. For although the fixed &s;tarres, and the highermo&s;t planets, becau&s;e of their vnmea&s;urable di|&s;tance from vs, make no diuer&s;ity of &s;ight to vs, from that which is &s;eene in the centre of the worlde: yet in the lowermo&s;t planets how much the neerer they be vnto vs, &s;o much the more is perceiued the euariation of their place appearing from that which thy haue vnto the centre of the world. For you mu&s;t vnder&s;tand that all calculations of the motions of all the &s;tarres and planets perfourmed by tables or Ephimerides, are done &amp; made to the centre of the world. Now becau&s;e the &s;peere of the moone is neere&s;t vnto vs, there is perceyued a manife&s;t diuer&s;ity betweene her place, which we &s;ee dwelling here on the circumference of the earth, &amp; her place which a line drawn from the centre of the world through the moon, doth &s;hew: becau&s;e the &s;emidiame|ter of the earth, according to which quantity we dwel from the centre, hath a &s;en&s;ible bigne&s;&s;e vnto the dy|&s;taunce of the moones &s;peere from vs. This diuer&s;itie is perceyued not only in the moone, but al&s;o in <HI>Mercury</HI> and <HI>Venus,</HI> and &s;omewhat in the &s;unne, though verye little, and &s;carce perceiuable: this diuer&s;ity of &s;ight called of <HI>Ptolomeus, Parallaxis,</HI> is greate&s;t in the moone: in the re&s;t it is almo&s;t neglected, neither is it alwaies a|like in the moone: which is a &s;ure argument that the moone is not carried in Homocentre &s;peeres, as &s;ome woulde haue auouched. But how much the more the moone departed from the centre of the world, and be|commeth. <HI>Apogea,</HI> &s;o much the le&s;&s;e happeneth this parallexis, and how much the neerer &s;he commeth to the earth being <HI>Hypogea.</HI> &s;o much the greater is this parall. &s;o that the greate&s;t parallaxis of all, is one degr. 6. min. And the lea&s;t which happeneth, the moon being in perig. is but 50. min. omitting a few &s;econds: in the &s;unn this parall. is 3. min. onely. This parallaxis, when it is &s;imply &s;poken of, it is meant the moone or planet beyng in the <HI>Finitor</HI> or horizon, in the zenith they can haue no parallaxis: for there the beame proceeding from our &s;ight, is all one with that which commeth from the centre of the world, but the more neere to the horizon, the greater. The&s;e things are plaine to tho&s;e that vnder&s;tand the theorickes, and are excellently demon&s;trated by Ptolomeus.</P>
<P>The &s;cope therefore of this chap. is by the greate&s;t horizontall parallaxis, giuen how to get the parallaxis of the moone for the altitude &s;he is in.</P>
<P>Gette therefore out of &s;ome tables of Eclip&s;es, or out of Copernicus, the moones greate&s;t or hory|zontall
<PB N="51" REF="35"> parallaxis for the fight, &s;he is in her &s;peeres, and likewi&s;e the moones height aboue the horizon by the fir&s;t or 32. though commonly in an Eclip&s;e, &s;he differeth not from the &s;unnes height. Then number the horizontall parallaxis on the <HI>Limbe</HI> from the Equinoctiall vpward, and therto lay the rule: which done, rec|kon on the rule from the centre, the moones di&s;ta~ce fro~ the zenith, or inwards from the <HI>Limbe</HI> the moones alti|tude all is one, the parallel cutting the rule there &s;heweth your de&s;ire.</P>
<P>This in&s;titution bicau&s;e it is mo&s;t plea&s;ant, by the which not without admiration of mo&s;t men, Eclip&s;es are progno&s;ticated long time before they happen, de&s;erueth an example.</P>
<P>As in the Eclip&s;e like to be 1590. mentioned in the 50. chap. the &s;un &amp; the moone &s;hall he in the 7 &frac12;. de. of &Leo;, this I &s;ay is their place calculated to the centre of the world: in the which luminaries &s;halbe coniun. Now therefore the que&s;tion is, what the &s;un &amp; moones vi&s;ible place &s;halbe, thereby to gather the euariation of the Eclip&s;e. For by rea&s;on of the euariation of the &s;ight or parallax. they &s;hall not be &s;eene here coniunct, as they are found to be in re&s;pect of the centre of the world: the altitude of the &Moon; is found 28 &frac13;. as well her latitude being 20. min. North, as her longitude accounted of, the greate&s;t parallaxis I found 52. min. Therfore in the <HI>Limbe</HI> I number not 52. min. as I &s;hould doe, but I reckon 5. deg. &frac14;. almo&s;t: &s;o that ech deg. &s;upplieth 10. min. the 5. deg. being here for the 50. min. and the other &frac14;. almo&s;t for 2. min, which is done becau&s;e els a huge in|&s;trument would be too little to perform this matter exactly. The rule being &s;o &s;et al 5 &frac14;. deg. almo&s;t, I rec|kon inwards thereon the height of the moone. vz. 28 &frac13; and there I &s;ee to cro&s;&s;e the rule the 4 &frac12;. parallel, now taking for ech of the 4. parallel 10. min. and for the half 5. min. the moones parallax|is according to that height and place: that is to &s;ay, the moone &s;hall be &s;eene here 45. min. lower then in truth &s;he is, in re&s;pect of the centre of the world in that Eclip&s;e.</P>
<P><FIGURE>

<P>Likewi&s;e appointing 5. deg. for 3. min. the greate&s;t parallax. of the &s;un, euery deg. is 40. &s;econdes: there place the rule, &amp; rec|kon the &s;aid 28 &frac13;. deg. inwards it &s;heweth the 4 &frac14;. parallel, whi+che commeth to 8. &s;core and ten, or 170. &s;econds, deuide that by 60. there commeth 2. min. &amp; 50. &s;econds, the parallaxis of the &s;un. Here you mu&s;t take heed that you &s;eeke not to work grea|ter angles in this manner: and in the&s;e le&s;&s;er, that you exceede not 10. deg. on the <HI>Limbe:</HI> for this ea&s;e &s;erueth but in &s;mall an|gles, Where the que&s;tion is of minutes, which in greater wil not holde proportion, but if a third or 4. part of a minute be wan|ting the errour is not much, but &s;o much of a degree is not al|lowable.</P>
<P><HI>Blagraue.</HI> Gemma Fri&s;ius &s;aith before in this chap. that the moones greate&s;t horizontall parallaxis is 1. deg. 6. min. beeyng in her Perigeon, and that the lea&s;t horizontall parallaxis is the moone being in her Apogeon 50. min. For the re&s;t he referreth you to tables. But now becau&s;e I woulde nor haue any de&s;irous hereof, to be &s;talledr of lacke of rabies or &s;ight in the Theorickes: I will &s;hew you after a blunt &s;ort how to gette the horizontall paral. of the moone according to her &s;ight between her apogeon and perigeon, by helpe of an Almanacke.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t I would haue you vnder&s;tand that at euery change and full of the moone, &s;he is in, or very neere her apogeon, and at euery quarter, in, or neere her perigion, therefore when as if it be true as Gemma Fri&s;ius &s;ai|eth, that the greate&s;t paral. in the perigeon is 1. degree 6. min. and the lea&s;t in the apogeon 50. min. &s;ubdu|cting the le&s;&s;e from the greater, there re&s;teth 16. min. the difference. The &s;pace of time betweene the quarter and full, or change, is 7. dayes, 9. houres or thereabouts, which maketh 177. houres, but account it here (for it hurteth not greatly) 180. houres. Now therefore this knowen, reckon the difference of the&s;e horizontall pa|ral. vz. 16. min. on the <HI>Limbe</HI> from the Equinoctiall, or rather as you were wont 8. deg. &s;o euery deg. repre&s;en|teth 2. min. thereto lay the rule: and by helpe of an Almanacke learne howe to any houres the moone is di|&s;taunt from the next ful or change, and reckon on the rule for euery two of tho&s;e houres one deg. on the rule from the <HI>Limbe</HI> inwards, and there marke what parallel cutteth: for it &s;heweth the minutes to be added to the moones lea&s;t horizontall paralaxis, videlicet 50. I would needes knowe her horizontall parallaxis, I looked in the almnacke, and there I &s;awe &s;he was at the full the 22. of October, at 6. of the clocke at nighte. I ca&s;te howe many houres were pa&s;&s;ed and found 50. houres, then laying the rule on 8. deg. in the <HI>Limbe,</HI> which here repre&s;ent ech 2. minutes. I reckoned thereon from the <HI>Limbe</HI> inwardes, for tho&s;e 50. houres 25. deg. there I &s;aw the 7 &frac14;. parallel to cut, which here repre&s;enteth but 14 &frac12;. min. to be added to 50. it maketh 64 &frac12;. min. or 1. deg. 4 &frac12;. min. the horizontal parallaxis for the time &s;ought for. VVhich being had, I might therby as before get the moones parallaxis for the height, &s;he was at <HI>&s;ed haec rudiori Minerua,</HI> by rea&s;on of the moones Epicircle, which cau&s;eth &s;ome errour.</P>

<P>THE parallaxis beyng now found in the circle of altitude, in whiche circle his mu&s;t needes happen: You
<PB N="52" REF="36"> &s;hall vnder&s;tand that &s;ometime it happeneth in longitude, whereby the &s;tarres &s;eem to haue another longi|tude then is found in tables calculated to the centre of the world, in&s;omuch that if the &s;tarre &s;halbe from the a&s;cendent, le&s;&s;e then 90. deg. he &s;hal &s;eeme to haue a greater longit. the~ in truth he hath, but being &s;ituate VVe&s;t wardes from the 90. degree he appeareth to &s;ight in le&s;&s;e longitude: but in the midde&s;t or 90. deg. of the E|clipticke, he maketh no parallaxis in longitude, but all in latitude. For then the circle of altitude is all one wyth the cyrcle of Longitude of the &s;tarre y&s;&s;uyng from the pole of the Zodiacke, by the Zenyth. But when the parallaxis falleth wholly in Latitude then the Eclipticke mu&s;te of nece&s;&s;itye cutte the Ze|nith and bee made one circle with the circle of altitude, this happeneth only to them that dwel either vnder one of the Tropickes, or betweene both. In other places the parallaxis doeth partly alter the longitude, and partly the latitude, &s;o that the neerer the moone &s;hal be to the 90. deg. of the Eclipticke, &s;o much the greater is the parallaxis of latitude and of the longitude le&s;&s;e: and contrariwi&s;e the further &s;he is from the 90. degree, the greater is the parallax of longitude, and the le&s;&s;e of latitude. And how much either of them is, may thus be had.</P>
<P>Seeke by the 54. the angle which the circle of altitude maketh with the Ecliptick in the place of the moon or of the &s;un: and by the la&s;t chapt. the parallaxis in the circle of altitude, reckon the quantity of the angle on the <HI>Limbe</HI> from the Equinoctial, and thereto lay the rule, then on the rule from the centre outwards, reckon the parallaxis found by the la&s;t chap. reckoning for euery 5. minutes therof one deg. on the rule, as you there did on the <HI>Limbe,</HI> the parallel cutting there, &s;heweth the parallaxis of latitude, accounting accordingly euery paral|lel for 5. min. Likewi&s;e following the houre line cutting the point of the rule with the &s;ame parallel vnto the Equinoctial line: it &s;heweth the parallaxis of long reckoning from the centre, taking euery houre line for 5. min. al&s;o. As in the 54. chap. the angle of the Eclipticke with the circle of altitude was found 34 &frac12;, the paral|laxis in the &s;ame circle by the la&s;t chap. was then 45. min. I reckon on the <HI>Limbe</HI> 34 &frac12; deg. and thereto lay the rule: then on the rule I reckon from the centre 45. min. or rather 9. degrees, &s;o that euery deg may heere re|pre&s;ent; 5. min. then doe I finde to cut the rule in that 9. degrees, the 5. parallel which here repre&s;enteth but 5. times 5. min. videlicet 25. &s;o many min. is the parallaxis in latitude.

<Q><BIBL>Gemma Fri&s;ius <HI>67.</HI></BIBL></Q>
<P>FIr&s;t &s;earch diligently when the time of the Suns Eclip&s;e &s;hall be, which then in truth is, when as the Sun and the Moon are &s;eene in one longitude. It hath byn already &s;aide in generall if the coniunction of the lights happen between the a&s;cendent and the 90. degr. of the Eclipticke. that the vi&s;ible coniunction go|eth before the true, as much as the parallexis in longit. commeth to: but if the place of coniunction be VVe&s;t from the 90. deg. then the vi&s;ible coniunctions (that is the mid&s;t of the eclip&s;e) &s;hal follow the true coniuction according to the proportio~ of the parallaxis in longitude. Therfore the time of the Eclip&s;e is gathered by the parallaxis in longitude. At in the example before, the parallaxis is found 39. min. in longitude, &s;o much the moone doth exceede the Sun almo&s;t at the houre of the true coniunction. The que&s;tion is now, how muche time it wil come too, while the moone is ouergoing the Sun this little &s;pace. Therefore we mu&s;t gather how muche the Sunne and how much the Moone doe goe in an houres &s;pace, and howe much the motion of the Moone is greater then the Sunnes in an houre, and that according to &s;ight, if a man wil handle this mat|ter curiou&s;ly. The houre motion of the moone is thus had. The time of the true coniunction of the &Sun; and &Moon; knowen by tables for that purpo&s;e, and the parallexis in long found by the la&s;t chap. if the coniunction be to come, adde one hour vnto the time of the true &conjunction;: and againe for that houre &s;eek the altitudes &amp; parallaxis of
<PB N="53" REF="36"> the &Sun; and &Moon; as before. Let the parallaxis of longitude be added to the true place, if the moone be Ea&s;twards from the 90. deg. of the Eclipticke, but &s;ubduct it out of the true place, if the &Moon; be VVa&s;twards, and &s;o &s;hall you haue theyr <HI>loca vi&s;a,</HI> places &s;eene. But if the true coniu~ction be pa&s;t which happeneth when the place of the true &conjunction;, is in the oriental quarter: then &s;ubduct one houre, &amp; &s;eek the <HI>loca vera</HI> the true places of the &Sun; &amp; &Moon;, for that time, and their parallaxes in longitude and latitude. And againe, adde or &s;ub&s;tract the parallaxes of long to or from the <HI>loca vera</HI> the true places of the light, and &s;o haue you their <HI>loca vi&s;a</HI> their places &s;een. The~ &s;ubduct the &s;eene place of the time going before out of the &s;een place of the time following, &s;o haue you the <HI>morus vi&s;ua</HI> the motion &s;een: that is, how much the planet goeth forwards in the Eclipticke according to &s;ight. But if you delight curious calculating, you mu&s;t do this, as well in the Sun as in the moon. And the you mu&s;t take the Sunnes motion &s;eene, out of the moones motion &s;eene. So &s;hall remaine the &s;uperation or exceeding of the moone aboue the Sunne in one houre according to &s;ight. Now therefore by the proportion of the pa|rallaxis in longitude vnto this houre &s;uperation you may gather the time between the true and &s;eene con|iunction or Eclip&s;e: appointing the fir&s;t number of the proportion, the houres outgoing or &s;uperation of the moone. The &s;econd one houre or 60. min. The third, the parallaxis in longitude. So &s;hall come forth the min. of the time &s;ought for, which being added too or &s;ubtracted from the time of the true coniunction, &s;heweth the time of the Eclip&s;e. The&s;e min. are added when as the place of the coniunction happeneth in the We&s;t quadrant of the Eclipticke, and are &s;ubducted in the Ea&s;t quarter. But this profitable in&s;titution mu&s;t needes haue an example.</P>
<P>VVherfore, in the Eclip&s;e hitherto intreated of the parallaxis of the moone in longitude, is found 39. min. The&s;e I adde becau&s;e they are in the Ea&s;t quarter, vnto the true place of the moone, which is 7 &frac12;. or &Leo;, and &s;o the place of the moone according to &s;ight, which I call the place &s;eene, or <HI>locus vi&s;us,</HI> &s;hall be 8. deg. 9. mi. &amp;, 0. &s;econds in &Leo;. The parallaxis in longit. of the &Moon; I will here omit for breuities &s;ake, whereby the place of the Sun &s;hall &s;till remayne 7. deg. 30. in &Leo;, being both the true place and here allowed for the &s;eene place. Nowe becau&s;e it is mo&s;t certaine that the middle of the Eclip&s;e which as before &s;ayd, is the vi&s;ible coniunction, doth goe before the true, we are againe to get the true places of the &Sun; and &Moon;, with their parallaxes for one houre before the true coniunction, that is, for 6. of the clocke 30. min. And then is the Sunnes true place 7. deg. 28. min. of &Leo;, the true place of the moone 6. deg. 56. min. of &Leo;: becau&s;e the houre motion of the moone is 34. min. The Horo&s;cope or a&s;cendent for this tyme is 0. deg. 20. min. in &Virgo; the deg. of culmination 19. degr 30. min. of &Taurus;, who&s;e meridian altitude is 56. Further, the di&s;tance of the deg. of culmination from the horo&s;cope is 100. deg. 50. min. of the Eclipticke, whereby the angle made betweene the horizon and the Eclipticke, is found to be 57. degrees 10. min. by the 51. Likewi&s;e the Sunnes altitude againe to bee 18. deg. &frac12;. and the moons altitude to be 18. deg. 20. mi. The angle of the Ecliptick with the circle of altitude is 53. almo&s;t by the 53. &amp; this is the angle of latitude, therfore &s;ubducting fro~ 90. there re&s;teth 55. the angle of longit. of the moone. The parallaxis of the moone in her circle of altitude is found 52. min almo&s;t by the 54. and in the &s;un 2. min. 30. &s;econds: therefore by the 55. the Sunnes parallaxis in longitude is almo&s;t 2. min. which beeing ad|ded to the true place of the Sunne, maketh for this houre the Sunnes place &s;eene 7. deg. 30. min. of &Leo;. La&s;tly, the moones parallaxis in longitude is 42. min. and better, by the 55. Therefore her place &s;eene, is by addying tho&s;e min. found to be 7. deg. 38. min. of &Leo;. Now therefore let vs take the place &s;eene of the Sun going be|fore, vz. 7. deg. 30. min. of &Leo;, out of the place following, vz. 7. 30. &Leo;, &s;o there remaineth 0. This nowe is the Sunnes houre motion appearing or &s;eene, which for want of paines commeth to nothing. In the like manner &s;ubduct the former motion of the moone appearing. vz. 6. deg. 56. of &Leo; out of the later which were gathe|red to be 7. deg. 38. min. of &Leo;, and &s;o is the houre motion of the moone founde to bee 42. min. For &s;o muche &s;hall the moone goe forwardes in one houre according to her motion appearing or &s;eene. And becau&s;e the Sunne maketh 0. his houre motion &s;eene, and the moone 42. min. taking 0. out fo 42. the moone &s;hal ouer|goe the Sunne 42. min. in an houre. The parallaxis of the moone in longitude at the time of the true coniun|ction was found 39. min. and of the &s;unne (if I had re&s;pected it) about 1. min. 20 &s;econds, but you mu&s;t take this but as an example, and worke it exactly your &s;elfe, therefore the moone had ouergone the Sunne then 38. min. 40. &s;econds according to fight. La&s;t of all, becau&s;e the moon doth ouergo the Sunne in an houre 42. min. &s;he &s;hall make 1. deg. 20. &s;econds (which is the difference of the Sunne and moones place &s;eene at the time of the true coniunction) in 2. min. 6/2. of an houre, with 6/42. of a min. ouer. This time therefore be|cau&s;e the coniunction &s;eene, goeth before the true, we mu&s;t take out of the time of the true coniunction, &s;o &s;hall remayne the time of the coniunction or Eclip&s;e, appearing vnto vs. vz. 7. of the clocke and almo&s;t 28. min.</P>

<Q><BIBL>Gemma Fri&s;ius <HI>69.</HI></BIBL></Q>
<P>VVHen as the Synode or coniunction of the lights happeneth neere one of the knots called <HI>Caput</HI> and <HI>Cauda draconis,</HI> then is there greate likelihood of an Eclip&s;e of the Sun to be. But it is a more certayne token if the place of the middle coniunction called <HI>Synodus media,</HI> happen le&s;&s;e then 20. deg. 40. min. before the <HI>Cauda,</HI> or after the <HI>Cauda</HI> le&s;&s;e then 11. deg. 20. min. Likewi&s;e if it happen before the <HI>Caput</HI> within the &s;pace of a 11. deg. 22. min. or after it within 20. deg. 40. min: then is it pos&s;ible that the Sun may be eclyp&s;ed, without the&s;e boundes there can be no Eclip&s;e. But the mo&s;t certaine token of all is, if the latitude &s;eene of the moone doe exceede the quantity of both the &s;emidiametres of the &s;unne and moone &s;eene, at the time of the Eclip&s;e &s;eene, then &s;hall the Sun &s;uffer no Eclip&s;e. Of the&s;e things the whole inqui&s;ition of the greatene&s;&s;e of the Eclip&s;e doth depend, vz. of the &s;emidiametres of the lights, and the latitude &s;eene at the time of the con|iunction <HI>vi&s;a,</HI> as well of the &Sun; as the &Moonlast;. But as much as belongeth to the inuention of the &s;emidiametres ap|pertayneth not properly to this in&s;trume~t, but is gotten by their proper tables. And here generally it is inough to &s;hew, that the &s;emidiameter <HI>vi&s;us,</HI> of the Sun neere his Apogeon, that is in &Cancer;, is &s;eene to be 15. min. &amp; 49. &s;econds almo&s;t, for which you may take 16. min. in &s;leight calculating, the &s;unnes Semidiam. <HI>vi&s;us,</HI> in the pe|rigeon is 17. min. Therefore when as the greate&s;t differeth from the lea&s;t but one min. there is no cau&s;e to &s;eek ouer curiou&s;ly for the other places, althogh the <HI>mutatio occentrotetis,</HI> maketh a litle diuer&s;ity in this behalf, but being almo&s;t in&s;en&s;ible, is here by me neglected. Now for the mnones <HI>Semidiametri apparentes,</HI> the lea&s;t is 15. min. and the greate&s;t that may happen in the coniunctions 17. min. 49. &s;econds, which differ little from 18. min. The&s;e therefore make ynough for our purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>For this take Gemma Fri&s;ius owne example, fir&s;t mentioned in his 62. he recyteth of an Eclip&s;e of the Sun to be anno 1560. the 21. day of Augu&s;t, at one of the clock 22. mynutes after noon, by Stophers tables, the Sun and Moone then being 7. deg. 45. min. in &Virgo;, the latytude at Louan beeing 51. degrees almo&s;t, where Gemma Fri&s;ius remayned. Nowe becau&s;e the &Sun; in this Eclip&s;e is more neere his apogeon beyng &Cancer;, then his perigion beeyng &Capri;, take for his Semyademetre &s;ixteene mynutes. The Moone is from hir Apogeon 5. <HI>dodecatemoria,</HI> that is 5. common &s;ignes and three degrees, and by that account beyng neere her perygeon, hath for her Semidiameter apparens 17. min. The&s;e Semidiametres therefore gathered into one &s;umme, make 33. mynutes: and if now the <HI>Latitudo vi&s;a</HI> of the moone were greater then this Sunne, then as I &s;ayde before, there coulde be no Eclyp&s;e. The <HI>Latitudo vi&s;a</HI> of the moone is thus gotten. You mu&s;t by the 55. gette the pa|rallaxis in latitude for the time of the <HI>Coniunctio vi&s;a:</HI> and likewi&s;e of the &s;unne, if there be any. Al&s;o the la|titude of the Moone for the &s;ame in&s;taunt, calculated as in the la&s;t Chapter by her true place and di&s;taunce from the neere&s;t knotte. If therefore this <HI>Latitude vera</HI> be North, and the parallaxis of latitude le&s;&s;e then it, deduct this from the true latitude, and &s;o remayneth her <HI>Latitudo vi&s;a</HI> Northwardes: but if the parallaxis of Latitude, be greater then the North Latitude, &s;ubducting the North latitude out of the parallaxis of latitude, there &s;hall be left the <HI>Latitudo vi&s;a</HI> Southwardes. But if the <HI>Latitude vera</HI> &s;hall be South, adde the parallaxis of Latitude to the <HI>Latitudo vera,</HI> and &s;o &s;hall you haue the <HI>Lititudo vi&s;a</HI> Southwardes. This therefore beyng got|ten, you mu&s;t take regarde al&s;o to the Sunnes paralaxis in Latitude, that is alwayes Southwards, becau&s;e the Sunne is alwayes in the Eclipticke, and all parallaxis happen downewardes. This therefore is all one wyth the parallaxis of Latitude. And it is alwayes added, when as the moones <HI>Latitudo vi&s;a</HI> is Northwardes, and is &s;ubtracted in her South <HI>Latitudo apparens,</HI> vnle&s;&s;e the &s;ame be le&s;&s;e. For then it is taken from the <HI>Latitudo vi&s;a</HI> of the Sunne, and &s;o remayneth the moones latitude from the Sunne appearing to our fight: which if you &s;ubduct from the number gathered of the Semidiametres of the &s;un &amp; moone, there &s;halbe left the part of the &s;unnes diametre darkened: and multiplying that by 12- and deuyding the product by the &s;unnes diametre, you &s;hal haue the poynts or dygites (as they cal them) of the Sunnes diametre darkened, as in this example the <HI>Coniunctio apparens</HI> or <HI>vi&s;a,</HI> by the 56. is at one of the clocke and 16, minutes, the horo&s;cope 3. degrees in &Sagitt;, the angle of the horizon: and the Eclipticke 44. deg. and 45. mynutes by the 51. the angle of latitude 88. degr. almo&s;t by the 53. The altitude of the &s;unne 44. degrees 42. minutes almo&s;t by the 31. whereby the paralax|is in latitude of the moone is 43. mynutes almo&s;t by the 55. So al&s;o the paralaxis of the &Sun; in latitude is two minutes, the <HI>Latitudo vera</HI> of the moone is 23. mynutes Northwardes, Nowe becau&s;e the parallaxis of laty|tude is 43. minutes, and the <HI>Latitudo vera</HI> 23. minutes North, &s;ubduct it out of 43. there remayneth 20. minut. the moones <HI>Latitudo vi&s;a</HI> Southwardes: but the Sunne al&s;o is &s;eene di&s;taunt from the Eclipticke 2. minutes <HI>per a&s;pectum.</HI> Therefore the Moone is &s;eene more Southwardes then the Sunne eighteene mynutes: thys is the <HI>Latitudo apparens</HI> of the Moone from the Sunne, which &s;ubducted from the number gathered of the &s;emy|diametres gotten before to be 33. minutes, there are left 15. minutes for the part of the &s;unnes diametre dar|kened.</P>

<P>MAke therefore a circle about the centre A, according to the bigne&s;&s;e of the Sunne, &s;o that AB, bee 15. min. and the whole diameter BC, 30. min. and AE. The <HI>Latitudo apparens</HI> of the Moon from the &s;un being in this la&s;t example 18. min.

And &s;o placing the one poynt of the compa&s;&s;e in the centre A, let the other touch the line EF in the poynt F.

<P>He therefore that woulde performe this matter curiou&s;ly &s;houlde as in the 56. get the <HI>motus apparens</HI> of the moone for one houre before the Eclip&s;e, and al&s;o for one houre after the midde&s;t of the Eclip&s;e, and the~ mea|&s;ure the &s;pace of the beginning of the eclip&s;e vnto the middle called <HI>&s;pacium incidentiae,</HI> by the <HI>motus horarius,</HI> go|ing before, and the &s;pace between the midde&s;t, and the end of the Eclip&s;e called <HI>redditus luminis</HI> by the houre motion of the houre following.

<Q><BIBL>Gemma Fri&s;ius <HI>71.</HI></BIBL></Q>
<P>THe Eclip&s;e of the moone hath an ea&s;ie calculation, the cau&s;e whereof is, that it dependeth not vppon the difference of &s;eeing it in any re&s;pect (as before in the &s;unne.) For as oft as there happeneth an E|clip&s;e of the moone, becau&s;e that &s;he beyng oppo&s;ite to the Sunne, lighteth into the &s;hadow of the earth, which extendeth it &s;elfe farre beyond the &s;peere of the moone, and taketh away the light which &s;he had of the Sunne: &s;he by this meanes eclip&s;eth in like bigne&s;&s;e and manner to all places of the world: and continueth like time, and is &s;eene euery where at one moment, although that it be accounted at diuers houres in dyuers places, according to the di&s;taunce and difference of the meridians, as hereafter I will &s;hew in the longitude of places.</P>
<P><HI>Blagraue.</HI> It appeareth here that Gemma Fri&s;ius had a meaning to intreate of the longitude of places whi|che Oh would God he had liued to haue performed, that it might haue beene my good happe to haue &s;een his vttermo&s;t, in that behalfe, by which meanes I &s;hould haue eyther &s;pared altogether the greate endeuour which I of neces&s;itie mu&s;t now for the credites &s;ake of my Iewell employ in that behalfe, or at the lea&s;t haue receyued &s;uch light from his doynges, that I might with ea&s;e haue gone through, with it. But now Gemma Fri&s;ius is gone, lamenting will not helpe: he left his &s;onne Cornel. Gemma behynde, who publi&s;hed his Fa|thers woorke of the Catholicon, and &s;tryued to augment it by his owne indu&s;trye: but God knowes, again&s;t the &s;treame. For a man may ea&s;ily knowe by the very matter and manner of it, his doyngs (of whi|che I haue omitted the mo&s;t part) from his fathers.</P>
<Q><BIBL>Gemma Fri&s;ius.</BIBL></Q>
<P>But now to come againe to the matter, as the Eclip&s;e of the moone is vniuer&s;all at one in&s;taunt, it is farre otherwi&s;e in the Sunne: for one &s;elfe &s;ame Eclip&s;e of the Sunne to &s;ome appeareth great, and la&s;ting: to other &s;ome little and gone in a moment: to &s;ome the North part, to &s;ome the South part of the Sunne is &s;eene to be darkened: and that in infinit diuer&s;ities.

<P><HI>Tho&s;e that dwel on this &s;ide of the earth do &s;ee the Sun eclip&s;ed.</HI></P>
</FIGURE> The cau&s;e of &s;o great variety, is the diuer&s;ity of the places whence the &s;un is beholde~: bicau&s;e that in the eclip&s;e of the Sunne he loo&s;eth not his light, as the common &s;ort do imagine: but only that the moone commeth betweene vs and the &s;un. VVhereby all countries &s;ee not the Eclip&s;e in one maner. In&s;omuch that &s;ome doe &s;ee the &s;unne in his ful light, when that others &s;ee him almo&s;t wholly eclip&s;ed. For the &s;ee|ing of it, according to the &s;cituation in &s;un|drye places, is the greate&s;t cau&s;e of the diuer&s;ity of the Eclip&s;e of the &s;unne. But in the Eclip&s;e of the moone, the view euery where doth vary it nothing, neyther in lo~|gitude nor latitude, for the moone is darke|ned indeede, where there the &s;un is not (as is already &s;aid:) and therfore are we forced to &s;eek &s;o many variations of a&s;pect in the &s;unne which in the moone needeth not. It &s;halbe &s;ufficient here to take the time of the true oppo&s;ition of the &s;un and moone for your meridian, either out of their proper ta+bles, or out of Ephimerides, rightly calcula|ted: &amp; for that time to get the true place of the &s;un in the eclipticke, who&s;e oppo&s;ite is the iu&s;t place of the moon: &amp; then &s;eek the latit. of the mooue very diligently, as is &s;hewed in the 58. chapter. La&s;tly you mu&s;t gette the diameter or &s;e|midiameter of the moone: and likewi&s;e the &s;emidiameter of the &s;hadowe of the earth, of what quantity it is in the place of the moones pa&s;&s;age. The &s;ame is &s;omtime greater, &s;omtime le&s;&s;e, for two cau&s;es: for when the &Moon; is neere her perig. &s;he findeth the &s;hade of the earth greater then in other places: the &s;hadow of the earth runneth out taperwi&s;e vnto a point at the la&s;t, &amp; becommeth le&s;&s;er by &s;o much the further as it extendeth fro~ the earth. Secondly, the &s;hadow of the earth may be greater in the &s;elf&s;ame place of the moons pa&s;&s;age, by rea|&s;on of the di&s;tance of the &s;un from the earth. For the neerer the &s;un commeth toward the centre of the earth, &s;o much the &s;hadow of the earth groweth the narrower &amp; &s;horter, contrarywi&s;e, by the &s;unnes bearing backe from the Earth, it is extended and enlarged in the &s;ame place of the &s;peere of the moone, in which it was nar|rower before, as by the&s;e figures you may &s;ee.</P>
<P>Therfore to our purpo&s;e you mu&s;t know by tables the time of the true oppo&s;ition of the &s;un &amp; the moone in the Eclip&s;e: and the place of the &s;un &amp; the moon for the &s;ame time, together with the latitude of the moon. And then the &s;emidiameter of the moon, &amp; of the &s;hadow, through which the moons pa&s;&s;age is. And here wil I &s;hew in brief as much as &s;hal &s;uffice the learner to get the &s;emidiamet. of the &s;un, the moon, &amp; of the &s;hade by the <HI>motus horarii,</HI> or diurnall motions of the Sunne and the moone. It is found out by the indu&s;try of ar|tificial men, that what proportion 20. beareth to 11. the &s;ame doth the &s;uns diurnal motion vnto his diamet, appering. Therfore multiply the &s;uns diurnal motio~ gotte~ out of any tables into 11. &amp; deuide the product by 20. &s;o haue you the diam. of the &s;un. The cau&s;e is, for that both the greatnes of the diamet. <HI>apparens</HI> of the &Sun;, &amp; <HI>y^e</HI> &s;wiftnes of the &s;uns motio~ are increa&s;ed &amp; dimini&s;hed in like proportion, according to <HI>y^e</HI> &s;ite of the &Sun; in his excentricke.</P>

La&s;tly the diametre of the &s;hadow of the earth you &s;hal thus get. Multiplie the diametre of the moone founde as before into 13. the product deuide by 5. and &s;o &s;hall you haue the greate&s;t quantitie of the &s;hadowe in that pa&s;&s;age of the Moone, that is to &s;ay, the &s;unne being in the Apogeon: but the &s;unne being in other places, the &s;hadow abateth in the &s;ame con&s;titu|tion of the &Moon;, as is &s;aid, by &s;o much the more as the &s;un commeth neare to the earth: and how much the diametre of the &s;hade is in another place, that is found by the <HI>motus horarius</HI> of the &s;unne, for by how much greater it waxeth in other places, the &s;hade of the earth is made le&s;&s;e, by &s;o much ten times told: The&s;e rules are both generall, exact, &amp; mo&s;t excellent, which by a familiar ex|ample I will manife&s;t.</P>
<P>In the yeare 1555. the 4. of Iune the 24. houre, and 42. min. there is like to be a great eclip&s;e of the Moone, which is to be knowne in that the place of the &Moon;, at the time of the true oppo&s;ition is not farre from <HI>Cauda Draconis.</HI> For the place of the &s;unne is according to com|mon tables &Pisces; 22. deg. 46. minutes, whereby the Moones place is &Sagitt; 22. 46. al&s;o the <HI>Caput Draconis</HI> is in &Pisces; 23. deg. 8. minutes, therefore <HI>Caeuda</HI> is in &Sagitt; 23. 8. &s;o that the true place of the Moone is but 21. minutes from <HI>Cau|da Draconis,</HI> wherby there is not onely knowne that an Eclip&s;e &s;hall be, but al&s;o a verie great one: for as oft as the Moone is aboue one deg. 8. min. in latitude any way, then &s;hall the Moone auoide the &s;hadow in her race. But heere the latitude of the Moone is &s;carce two min. which is a token that the Moone &s;halbe verie neere the centre of the &s;hadow of the earth in this Eclip&s;e. Now to know the quantitie &amp; continuance of the &s;ame, we mu&s;t know the &s;emidiametre of the Moone, &amp; of the &s;hade of the earth by the rules before &s;hewed. The <HI>Motus Diurnus</HI> of the &Moon; in that place is 13. deg. 5. therefore her <HI>Motus horarius</HI> &s;halbe 32. min. 40. &s;ec. and &s;omwhat le&s;&s;e: then this &s;halbe the diametre of the moone: but if you wil know it exqui&s;itly, multiply 32. min. 40. &s;ec. by 47. &amp; deuide the product by 48. &amp; &s;o &s;hal you haue 32. min. 20. &s;ec. almo&s;t, &amp; the &s;ame is the iu&s;t diametre of the Moone: halfe that vz. 16. min. 10. &s;ec. is her &s;emidiameter: which multiplie by 13. and the product deuide by fiue, you haue the diametre of the &s;hade of the earth in the place of the Moones pa&s;&s;age in her &s;phere, the &s;un being in his apogeon, the multiplication of the diametre maketh 25 220. &s;ec. the diui&s;ion produceth 5044. &s;ec. that is 84. min. 4. &s;ec. &s;o that the &s;emid. of the &s;hade is 42. min. 2 &s;ec. And becau&s;e the &s;un is neare his apoge|on, the &s;hadow of the earth cannot be dimini&s;hed any quantity, to be accounted of by rea&s;on of the &s;uns com|ming neare vnto the earth, otherwi&s;e you &s;hould heere &s;eeke the <HI>motus horarius</HI> of the &Sun; being in his apogeon and al&s;o for the place where he now is, and the difference of the&s;e motions decuplied, that is multiplied by 10. &s;hould be taken from the greatne&s;&s;e of the &s;hade here found, &amp; &s;o &s;hall you haue the exqui&s;ite bigne&s;&s;e of the &s;hade of the earth, but here for methodes &s;ake we thinke not good to pro&s;ecute euery lea&s;t matter, but leaue &s;uch curio&s;itie to tho&s;e that haue more lei&s;ure, or who are whollie addicted to the&s;e &s;tudies. By the&s;e things found, you may onely by drawing of a figure knowe the greatnes and duration of theclip&s;e, draw therefore the &s;treight line AB, which &s;hall be the 22. deg. of &Sagitt; deuided into 60. min. Then in the 46. min. in which &s;hall be the centre of the &s;hadow of the earth, that is to &s;ay, oppo&s;ite to the &Sun; at the time of the true oppo&s;ition, place the one foote of your compa&s;&s;e, and there according to the quantitie of the &s;emidiametre of the earth now founde videlizet 42. minutes, make a circle for the &s;hadow of the earth, the centre being C, whereon draw the line DE perpendiculer to AB, which is the circle of the latitude of the Moone, and becau&s;e the latitude of the &Moon; is found 2. min. northwards, take in your compas 2. of the 60. parts of AB, &amp; place the &s;ame from C. towards D in the point E. &amp; that is the centre of the Moone: in this centre according to the &s;emidia|metre of the &Moon; vz. 16. min. 10. &s;ec. make the circle of the moone, which being done you &s;hal &s;treight &s;ee before

And if you deuide the whole diametre of the moone into 12. digits, you &s;hall apparantly &s;ee how many digits or points theclip&s;e of the moone &s;hall be. For looke how many digits of the moones diametre DF. &s;hall con|taine (with the di&s;tance from the vttermo&s;t &s;hade of the earth vnto the edge of the moone farthe&s;t drenched within the darkne&s;&s;e) &s;o many digits or points as they now call them &s;hall theclip&s;e be &s;aid to be. For D is the point of the &s;hadow of the earth, mo&s;t bending from thecliptick towards the which the moone departeth, but by numbers we &s;hall thus proceed. Becau&s;e EF is 16. min. &amp; 10. &s;ec. and the latit. of the Moone EC. 2. min. therfore CF &s;halbe 14. min. 10. &s;ec. to which there being added CD, being 42. min. 2. &s;ec. the whole DF &s;hal be 56. min. 12. &s;ec.

The moone her &s;elfe conteineth not aboue 12. points, but the depth of the moone within the &s;hadow of the earth &s;halbe almo&s;t 20. dig. wherby you &s;hal vnder&s;ta~d that when as the greatnes of theclip&s;e exceedeth 12. digits, then &s;hal there be an eclip&s;e with tarriance, as they call it, that is, the moone &s;hal tary a certaine &s;pace in the darknes before &s;he &s;hal receiue her light againe of the &s;un: &amp; how many the more digits there &s;halbe found, by &s;o much the longer &s;hall the tariance of the moone be in the darkne&s;&s;e, &amp; the whole eclip&s;e endure: both which exactly to de&s;crie, thus mu&s;t you do. Open your com|pa&s;&s;e to the quantitie of the &s;emidiam. of the earth and the &Moon; ioyned togither as in this example, vnto 58. min. 12. &s;ec. and on the centre of the &s;hadow of the earth vz. C. de&s;cribe a hidden or blind circle, and note wel the touching of this circle with the way of the Moone. I cal the way of the moone a line drawne by the centre of the moone vz. E, parallel if you li&s;t to the line AB. or if you be di&s;po&s;ed to pro&s;ecute the&s;e matters more nar|rowly: let this line make with DF the blunt angle DEM. of 95. deg. as heere the line LEHM. is, for this is the true way of the Moone whereby H is the place of the next knot. This line is cut of the blind circle in the points L &amp; M, in which points the Moone being, maketh the beginning and end of theclip&s;e. La&s;tly, from the 2. inter&s;ections of the &s;hadow of the earth, and the way of the moone, &s;et the &s;emid. of the moone by helpe of your compa&s;&s;e in the way of the Moone vz. in N and O. For in the one of the&s;e places the Moone is altoge|ther entred into the &s;hadow of the earth and in the other, beginneth to get out thereof. Therefore you haue 5. moones if you li&s;t, the fir&s;t on the centre L. where the &Moon; begins to eclip&s;e: the next on the centre o, when &s;he is wholly darkned: the third on the centre E, when &s;he is in the middle of theclip&s;e, the fourth on the centre N. when &s;he beginneth to get light againe: the la&s;t on M. where theclip&s;e endeth, &s;o that LO is the &s;pace, that the moone goeth from the beginning vntill &s;he be all darkned, and ON of her whole darkning, which they call the tariance in Latin <HI>Mora:</HI> therefore OE is halfe her tariance called <HI>(Dimidia mora.)</HI> All which parts you may mea&s;ure with your compa&s;&s;e by the parts of theclipticke before made: and deuiding ech of them by the <HI>Supe|ratio horaria</HI> of the moone you &s;hall haue all the times &s;ought for, or the whole taken togither vz. LM. And by numbers may thus be performed. For that EC is 2. min. in latitude, and &s;tandeth almo&s;t perpendiculer on LM. the way of the &Moon;, therfore the &s;quare of LC &s;hal be equal to the &s;quares of LE, and EC. therfore taking the &s;quare of EC out of the &s;quare of LC, there &s;hal remaine the &s;quare of LE by the la&s;t propo&s;ition &s;auing one, of the fir&s;t booke of Euclide: For LC is the &s;um gathered of the &s;emidiametres of the moone, and the &s;hade vz. 5. 8. minutes, 12. &s;econds, but letting pa&s;&s;e the &s;econds, the &s;quare of LC &s;hall be equall to 3364- herehence taking the &s;quare of CE, vz. 4. there is left 3360. the &s;quare of LE, who&s;e &s;ide is &s;omwhat le&s;&s;e then 58. and that is the line LE, &s;o much al&s;o is EM. Let no man carpe heere becau&s;e we &s;aide that CE was perpendicular to the Moones way, when as before we drew him perpendiculer to theclipticke, the be&s;t learned men will neglect &s;o much, becau&s;e it bringeth no perceiueable error. Therefore the line LE be|ing knowne to bee fiue 58. minutes almo&s;t, take out of that the &s;emidiametre of the Moone vz. 16. minutes 12. &s;econds, the line LO &s;halbe 41. min. 48. almo&s;t, which they call <HI>minuta incidentiae,</HI> and NM is almo&s;t equal vnto it, called <HI>minuta repletionis.</HI> La&s;tly &s;ubduct LO being the minuts of theclip&s;e waxing out of LE, there &s;hal be left OE halfe the tarriance vz. 17. min. 12. &s;econds almo&s;t.

<P>BY this Chap. and others following is &s;hewed to find the di&s;tance of &s;tars, &amp; al&s;o of townes, cities, &amp; pla|ces as ea&s;ily, and redily as on the globe it &s;elfe, which no doubt mu&s;t needs make the in&s;trument very de|lectable. The longit. and latit. of any two &s;tars had, &s;ubtract the greater long. out of the le&s;&s;e, &s;o haue you the difference, which being had, number in the <HI>Limbe</HI> from thequinoctial the greate&s;t latitude of the two &s;tars &s;outhwards, if the latit. be &s;outh, or northwatds, if north: and thereto lay the Zenith point of the <HI>Reete,</HI> then in the meridian reckoned from the <HI>Limbe</HI> an&s;werable to the difference of longit. number the lat. of the other &s;tar and that from thequinoctiall accordingly, and the azimuth cutting there, &s;heweth the di&s;tance &s;ought for, if you reckon thereon thence to the zenith point.</P>
<P><HI>Example.</HI> I would know how many degrees <HI>Canis maior</HI> is from <HI>Oculus tauri</HI> I finde by Stophler (for any ta|bles will &s;erue the turne, as well old as new for that their difference of long. and their latit. neuer alter) that the longit. of <HI>Oculus tauri</HI> was then in &Gemini; 2 18/60 deg. that is from 0. in &Aries; 62 18/60 deg. and his latitude, 5. deg. 10/60 &s;outhwards. Likewi&s;e <HI>Canis maior</HI> in &Cancer;. 7 18/60 which commeth to 97 18/60 deg. from &Aries;, and his latit. to be 36 10/60 &s;outhwards al&s;o. Now &s;ubducting the le&s;&s;e longit. vz. 62 18/60 out of the greater vz. 97 18/60 there re&s;teth 35. the difference of longitude. Fir&s;t therefore I reckon in the <HI>Limbe</HI> from thequinoct. line, the greate&s;t latit. of the&s;e vz. 39 10/60 towards the &s;outh pole, becau&s;e the latitude is &s;outh, and thereto I &s;et the zenith of my <HI>Reete</HI> then in the 35. meridian counted from the <HI>Limbe,</HI> I reckon the le&s;&s;er latitude from thequin. line vz. 5 10/60 deg. &s;outh|wards, al&s;o becau&s;e that lat. was likewi&s;e &s;outh: this done, I &s;ee the 52 &frac14; azimuth to cut the place of the &s;econd &s;tarre who&s;e deg. betweene the &s;ame place and the zenith by helpe of the almicantaries, I finde to bee 46 &frac14; therfore I boldly pronounce that the di&s;tance betweene <HI>Oculus tauri</HI> and <HI>Canus maior</HI> is 46 &frac14; degrees.</P>

<P>THis may you do by the 38. Chap. getting their longit. and latit. out of the heauens, &amp; then proceeding by the la&s;t Chap. But yet an ea&s;ier way without al that circum&s;tance is thus: take the altitude and azi|muthes of both &s;tarres at one in&s;tant, or at the lea&s;t the di&s;tance of their azimuthes without re&s;pect of the meridian: the&s;e had the working is all one with the la&s;t Chapt. but onely chaunging the names, the dif|ference of their azimuthes, for the difference of longitude: and their altitudes for their latitudes, and where as the equinoctiall did in the la&s;t Chapter repre&s;ent the Eclipticke, hee mu&s;t heere repre&s;ent the horizon and the parallels, circles of altitude, &amp;c. This needeth no example, for if you will &s;uppo&s;e the altitudes
<PB N="61" REF="40"> of two &s;tarres equall with the latitudes in the la&s;t Chapt. and the di&s;tance of their azimuthes equall to the difference of longitude there, the matter is already performed.</P>

<P><HI>Blagraue.</HI> Truely the&s;e are very prettie conclu&s;ions &amp; plea&s;ant, but yet not &s;ufficient to correct and amend the places of fixed &s;tarres and planets, and the whole globe, as G.F. affirmeth, except they be performed by a very huge in&s;trument at the lea&s;t of 10. foote diametre. But the onely way in&s;trumentally to performe the&s;e things in my opinion <HI>(Saluo meliori iudicio)</HI> is by their cro&s;&s;e &s;taffe to take their di&s;tances, and thereby to rectifie their places of longitude and latitude, vpon a great quadrant, as I will &s;hewe you hereafter in my booke of logitudes if God giue me leaue and lei&s;ure once to come to it, to the which no doubt the&s;e Chapters are good preambles and introductions, notwith&s;tanding for tho&s;e that take delight in varieties, I will &s;omwhat helpe to fit their fancies. If you would know the di&s;tance of any two &s;tarres placed in my <HI>Reete,</HI> turne it about till &s;ome one meridian touch the apex or point of either &s;tar, and the degrees of the &s;ame meridian included be|tweene them, numbred by helpe of the parallels &s;heweth your de&s;ire, but then you mu&s;t be &s;ure that the&s;e &s;tarres be both North, or both South, declining from thequinoctiall. In my <HI>Reete</HI> I appointed all the North &s;tarres to point outwards from the centre, and the South inwards.</P>
<P><HI>Example. Oculus tauri,</HI> &amp; <HI>Canis minor</HI> are north &s;tars, and in my <HI>Reete</HI> their apex pointeth outward, turne the <HI>Reete</HI> about &amp; at la&s;t you &s;hal find the 17 &frac13; meridian to touch both their apex &amp; the di&s;tance betweene them on the &s;ame meridian 46 &frac12; deg. But if one &s;tar be North &amp; the other South, yet wil I wi&s;h you wel: then turne about the <HI>Reete</HI> vntill the apex or points of either &s;tarre do touch ech a &s;eueral meridian, but equally taken on ech &s;ide of the axtreeline, and then mu&s;t you reckon from the one of them to the pole, and from the pole backe againe to the other, and &s;o haue you your de&s;ire.</P>
<P><HI>Example.</HI> Of <HI>Oculus tauri</HI> &amp; <HI>Caris maior,</HI> the one in my <HI>Reete</HI> pointeth outwards, the other inwards, wherfore I turne the <HI>Reete</HI> till at the la&s;t I finde <HI>Oculus tauri</HI> to cut the 46. meridian on the left &s;ide of the axtreeline, and <HI>Canis maior</HI> the 46. meridian on the right &s;ide of the axtree, where I finde from <HI>Oculus tauri</HI> to the pole 23 &frac14; deg. and from the pole to <HI>Canis maior</HI> 23 &frac12; deg. the&s;e put togither make 46 &frac34; deg. the di&s;tance of the&s;e two &s;tarres.</P>

<Q><BIBL>Gemma Fri&s;ius <HI>82.</HI></BIBL></Q>
<P>THE Philo&s;ophers affrme that a Comet is ingendered of a &s;oft clammie &s;lime, or vi&s;cous &s;ub&s;tance, apt to nouri&s;he fire drawen vp into the higher mo&s;te region of the ayre, and there is &s;et on fire, by the firy element, to whiche he is very neer: &amp; that his taile co~meth of the flowing or dragging of <HI>y^e</HI> matter, like as in &s;tarres that &s;hoote, where the matter of exhalation is, by his &s;hutting drawen in length. But as concer|ning the tayle, that cannot bee &s;o, both becau&s;e his motion is verye &s;lowe, and al&s;o for that it hath alwayes been ob&s;erued of learned men, as namely, Apian and others, that the tayle of euery Comet extendeth it &s;elfe directly from the Sunne, &s;o that the Comet his taile, and the Sun are in one great circle, as at all times by the la&s;t chapter, you may proue when any Comet happeneth.</P>
<P><HI>Cornelius Gemma.</HI> It hath plea&s;ed God, as it &s;hould &s;eeme, to take away Gemma Fri&s;ius, when he hadde perfourmed thus farre, and before he had furni&s;hed this chapter, whiche his &s;onne Cornelius G. took in hand to acco~pli&s;h &amp; pro&s;ecute the &s;ame very tediou&s;ly, to little purpo&s;e, as hee doth all the propo&s;itions &amp; chap|ters afterwards, which I mean to abreuiate in as much as &s;halbe nece&s;&s;ary, &amp; the rather becau&s;e I &s;hall &s;tuffe out this worke with &s;uch &s;tore of matter, that there will be no place for &s;uperfluities. Hee taketh occa&s;ion here vtterly to condemne all the Philo&s;ophers, who &s;ay that there is a firie region or clement next aboue the ayre, affirming that all fire and heate remayneth in the Sun. And further, that Comets are &s;et on fire by the Sunne only: his greate&s;t rea&s;on is, for that if the comet were &s;et on fire by force of the firy element, then mu&s;t of nece&s;&s;itie his taile bee rounde about alike, but becau&s;e the tayle is alwayes found directly from the Sunne, therefore it is manife&s;t, that the Sunne is the only cau&s;er of his flamme, appoint the Sunne, the Comet and his taile, in&s;teede of the three &s;tarres in the la&s;t chapter, and the working is all one, if you li&s;t to make expe|rience thereof.</P>

NO is not much vnlike to KI: yet for fa&s;hions &s;ake it is made &s;omewhat like the cocke of a qualifier or gunne, and &s;tandeth an inche aboue the rule AB with a foote, his office is to hold a penne or a &s;teele poin|ter fa&s;t, being put in the hollowe riuet A, that it &s;tirre not in grauing, to which purpo&s;e one checke mu&s;t bee thicke, and the other thinner, as KI was.

<P>THough this inuention with three rules bee &s;o excellent to drawe great arches in great in&s;truments that all other deui&s;es be almo&s;t friuolous, yet wyll I &s;hewe you a great &s;ecret or two, whiche I v&s;ed for my helpe before the &s;ame was knowen, not becau&s;e I woulde haue you v&s;e it in that behalfe: but for that I haue founde great plea&s;ure, &amp; nece&s;sitie of it in working other inuentions and proiections of the &s;pheare, For A&s;tronomicall dials, mappes, and other matters more then I will &s;peake of till time &s;erue: in the meane &s;ea&s;on make account of it. If you remember, in the &s;econde booke and eight chapter, I &s;hewed you to deuide the two halues of the Zodiacke from their &s;euerall poles: a&s;&s;ure your &s;elfe in very lyke manner, prooue it when you will, may you deuide any meridian of the <HI>Mater</HI> into the &s;ame diui&s;ions that any of them is deui|ded by the parallels, and that without drawing the parallels, if in the noone line you &s;eeke the center or ra|ther pole of any &s;uche meridian as farre backwardes within the center of the <HI>mater,</HI> as the meridian that &s;houlde bee deuided lyeth within the <HI>limbe.</HI> For example, if you woulde deuide the 30. meridian, counted from the <HI>Limbe</HI> on the South halfe of the <HI>mater,</HI> &s;eeke then where the 30. meridian, from the center on the North halfe of the <HI>mater,</HI> doth cro&s;&s;e the noone line: and there is your pole or center mo&s;t a&s;&s;uredly, wher|on keeping the one end of a rule, and laying the other ende on euery of the deg. of the South halfe of the <HI>limbe,</HI> eache after other: you may thereby deuide the &s;aide 30. meridian, euen as eyther halfe of the Zodiacke was deuided from their &s;euerall poles in the &s;aid &s;econd book and eight chapter. And when this 30. meridi|an is thus deuided, you &s;hall finde tho&s;e diui&s;ions equall to tho&s;e, which are made by the cro&s;&s;ing of the pa|rallels, which you may &s;ufficiently gather by the la&s;t way, which I taught in the &s;econde booke and nienth chapter, to deuide your Zodiack by. I &s;ay in this maner may you denide any of the meridians if you &s;eek his pole in the noone line, as farre beyonde the center as the meridian is within the <HI>limbe,</HI> and thereon as from a center deuide him by the oppo&s;ite halfe of the <HI>limbe.</HI> For in very truth, as I &s;ay, that point is the very pole of euery &s;uch meridian, as in my next booke of &s;pherical triangles will appeare. And thus may you not onely deuide the meridians but generally euery arche what&s;oeuer, repre&s;enting a great circle or &s;emicircle of the &s;pheare, which is &s;pecially to bee accounted of, and wil, beyng ioyned to the 4. and 6. chapter of the &s;econde booke, yeeld exceeding fruite and plea&s;ure in proiecting of the globe. Before the inuention of the &s;aid three rules I was determined in making of great in&s;truments to deuide euery 5. or 10. meridian in this manner and then by &s;hort &s;treight lines to drawe the parallels.</P>

VVherefore if you cro&s;&s;e this eclipticke line &s;quare on the center, with a blinde line it &s;hall touch in the <HI>Limbe</HI> the one ende of eyther pole circle, where doubt you not, but the poles of the eclipticke are. Therefore from eyther of tho&s;e points you may deuide him, by lay|ing the rule on euery degree of the halfe <HI>Limbe</HI> farthe&s;t off from the &s;ame point, as in the &s;econd booke, and fourth chapter, the Equinoctiall line was deuided from one of his poles: then &s;et too the Caracters of the Signes, the beginning of &Aries; and &Libra;, to be at the center: &amp; of &Cancer; at the <HI>Limbe</HI> or end of the Eclipticke on the right hand, &Capri; at the left: the re&s;t in order as I hope you knowe by this time.

<P>BEcau&s;e in the fir&s;t chapter of this booke I coun&s;ailed you to adde vnto your great <HI>Iewell</HI> the cro&s;&s;e &s;taffe, I thought good to &s;hew you, partly by this chapter, that he will &s;erue you to nece&s;&s;ary purpo&s;e. VVhere|fore according to Gemma Fri&s;ius in&s;truction in his booke <HI>de radio A&s;tronomico,</HI> you &s;hal by the cro&s;&s;e &s;taffe take the di&s;tance of any planet you &s;hal &s;ee in the heauens, who&s;e longitude you de&s;ire, fro~ &s;ome one knowe~ fixed &s;tarre, that is to &s;ay, &s;uch a &s;tare who&s;e longitude and latitude is knowen: which had, you &s;hall then re|&s;ort to the <HI>Ephemeris</HI> or &s;ome other like tables, and get the latitude of the planet for that day, nowe place the Zenith poynt of your <HI>reete</HI> &s;o many degrees of the <HI>limbe</HI> aboue the equinoctiall, as the latitude of the fixed &s;tar commeth to: the <HI>reete</HI> there fixed, marke where the Almicantare counted from the zenith point, equall to the di&s;tance taken by the cro&s;&s;e &s;taffe, doth cut the parallel counted from the equinoctiall, equall to the planets latitude had in the <HI>Ephemeris,</HI> and the meridian cro&s;sing there with them, followed too the equinoctiall line &s;hall &s;hewe you theron the deg. and min. of the difference of longitude betweene the &s;tarre and the planet, which if the planet be Ea&s;twardes of the &s;tarre, you &s;hall adde to the &s;tarres longitude, if VVe&s;twardes, &s;ub|duct it, and &s;o &s;hall you haue the longitude of the planet de&s;ired: remembring this by the way, that if the la|titudes both of the &s;tarre and planet be one way, that is to &s;ay both North or both South, then mu&s;t you af|ter you haue placed the zeneth point at the <HI>Limbe</HI> fixed as before, take the &s;aid parallel on the &s;ame &s;ide of the equinoctiall, as the zenith point is: but if the one bee North, the other South, then take the &s;aid parallell on the further &s;ide of the Equinoctial.</P>
<P>For example. The 14. day of October 1582. about 6. of the clocke in the morning, I tooke the di&s;ta~ce of the firie redde planet, &Mars;, from the great &s;tarre of the light called <HI>humerus dexter orionis,</HI> Oriones right &s;houl|der, by a cro&s;&s;e &s;taffe of my fa&s;hion for want of G.F. and founde the &s;ame 31. degrees 37. minutes. and 30. &s;econdes, for my &s;taffe was large. The latitude of the &s;aid &s;tarre of Orion, is, and euer hath been, and there|fore this working is the more certain, 17. degrees &s;outhwardes from the eclipticke, which by my tables of fixed &s;tarres, you may finde: the latitude of &Mars;, by <HI>Leouitius Ephemeris</HI> was then one degree verye neere North|wardes, the&s;e had, I reckon on the <HI>Limbe</HI> from the equinoctiall towardes the South pole of my <HI>Iewel,</HI> the &s;aid 17. degrees, being the latitude of Orion: thereto I place the zenith point of the <HI>reete</HI> fixed: then among the parallels towardes the North pole, I reckon one degree beeyng the latitude of Mars, found in the <HI>Ephemeris.</HI></P>
<P>Nowe then where the 31. 37/60. almicantare counted from the Zenith doth cut the &s;aide fir&s;t parallel (for I leaue out the &s;econdes in &s;mall io&s;truments) there doe I &s;ee the 26 &frac14;. meridian counted from the <HI>Limbe</HI> to cro&s;&s;e, the &s;ame was the difference of longitude betweene the &s;aid &s;tarre of Orion and Mars at that in&s;tant. The longitude of that &s;tarre after Stadius is 23. degrees in &Gemini;, and at that time I &s;awe Mars Ea&s;twardes of this &s;tar. Therefore I adde this difference here found, vz. 26 &frac14;. to this longitude of the &s;aide &s;tarre being 23. in &Gemini;, and counting it according to the &s;equele of the &s;ignes, it falleth out too bee the 19. degree &amp; 15. min. of &Cancer;. which I conclude to be the place of Mars, his longitude at that in&s;tant. But &s;ome will here &s;ay to what purpo&s;e is this if wee goe to the <HI>Ephemeris</HI> for the latitude of the planet, then were it as good to take the lon|gitude there al&s;o. True it is in &s;ome re&s;pect, but yet &s;hall you &s;ee commonly that <HI>Ephimerides</HI> will differ in the longitude of the planets one from another, be&s;ides, when <HI>Ephemerides</HI> are made by diuers men to diuers lon|gitudes, then may they differ, and yet be both true. VVherefore by this chapter you may with greater &s;peede then Gemma Fri&s;ius or any other hath before taught, for ought that I euer read, both examine the truth of your <HI>Ephemeris,</HI> and of diuers of them, which is the true&s;t &amp; mo&s;t neer to the longitude of your countrie. And though in their <HI>Ephemerides</HI> they &s;houlde differ muche in the longitudes of the planets, yet they cannot erre greatly in the latitude, if they doe, a little cannot hinder your purpo&s;e in working after this chapter, &s;o you take your di&s;taunce truely, as for the purpo&s;e you &s;hall finde there that &Mars; goeth but 2 minutes in latitude e|uery day, &s;o that where before you tooke one degree or 16. minutes: if you had taken 60. minutes, which is the latitude of &Mars; two dayes before, and wrought as before, you &s;houlde haue committed no &s;en&s;ible errour in the longitude. Though this experience be mo&s;t plea&s;ant to examine the places of the planets, yet med|dle not with the Moone: for her tickle &s;wift cour&s;e found in tables, and her vntowarde parallaxe in takyng her di&s;tance, will di&s;appoint you. But if it plea&s;e God to lend mee life, and that this wrangling worlde alow mee lea&s;ure, wherein the&s;e &s;ixe or &s;euen yeeres I haue fared like a tenni&s;e ball to&s;t vp and downe, I wyll in my boke of longitude of the places, &s;o &s;ufficiently prouide you for euery &s;huttle nycitie of the Mone, that he &s;hall haue no &s;tarting hole to deceiue you. You &s;hall be fully in&s;tructed to meete her at euery turne, yea e|uen to leade her in a &s;tring, as they &s;ay, and that at plea&s;ure.

<P>HOw to get the altitude of the &s;unne, or any point of theclipticke, by this con&s;titution hath beene taught by G.F. as in my 3. book 54. Chap. appeareth, but for any planet, &s;tar or point of the heauens hauing lat. you are there neuer the neare, nor yet for the azimuth although it be had in the 11.

Now therefore by the houre and minute propo&s;ed, hauing &s;et your <HI>Iewel</HI> to the con&s;titution of this la&s;t Chapt. you &s;hall by the 3. booke 20. Chapt. learne the amplitude of the a&s;cendent for that in&s;tant, which if it be of a North &s;igne, you &s;hall reckon on thequinoctiall line, which heere repre&s;enteth the <HI>Finitor</HI> from the centre rightwards towards noone, and there is your Ea&s;t point, and the me|ridian or houreline cutting there, repre&s;enteth the Ea&s;t azimuth, but if your a&s;cendent be a &s;outh &s;igne, then count the amplitude leftwards towards <HI>Medianox,</HI> and there &s;halbe your Ea&s;t point and your Ea&s;t azimuth, which point and azimuth being found, you may ea&s;ily reckon from then&s;e your azimuthes, and that alwayes rightwards towards the <HI>Limbe,</HI> and then&s;e backwards againe, and &s;o round as occa&s;ion &s;hall &s;erue, remem|bring that the 90. azimuth from this Ea&s;t point &s;o counted mu&s;t needs be your meridian.</P>
<P>As for example, in the natiuity of our vertuous king Edward, the altitude of the <HI>Nonage&s;simus gradus</HI> was 58 2/4 deg. by the 11. or 15. wherefore that reckoned on the <HI>Limbe</HI> from thequinoctiall and the <HI>Finitor</HI> thereto laid, then doth it repre&s;ent theclipticke circle placed to this &s;aid con&s;titution, the a&s;cendent and de&s;cendent being in the centre of the <HI>Iewel</HI> by the 16. but becau&s;e the a&s;cendent is of a north &s;igne in this natiuitie vz. the 5. of &Virgo; and the amplitude thereof by the 3. booke 20. Chapt. 16 &frac12; deg. I reckon on thequinoct. which now repre&s;en|teth the <HI>Finitor,</HI> the &s;ame 16 &frac12; deg. and that from the centre rightwards towards noone, and there I conclude to be the ea&s;t point and that the 16 &frac12; meridian is thea&s;t azimuth, and then if from this 16 &frac12; meridian you rec|kon to the <HI>Limbe,</HI> and then&s;e backe againe vntill your reckoning come to 90. the houreline there ending repre&s;enteth the meridian or &s;outh azimuth, being here the 16 &frac12; counted from the <HI>Limbe</HI> backe againe, &s;o that hereby you may ground this generall rule, looke howe much the amplitude or ea&s;t point goeth rightwards from the centre, &s;o much the meridian commeth backe from the <HI>Limb</HI> leftwards, and how much the amplitude goeth leftwardes &s;o much the meridian commeth &s;hort of the <HI>Limbe</HI> in reckoning, wherefore when you haue &s;et theclipticke circle to the con&s;titution of the 16.

Chapter I reckon 46. deg. on the <HI>Limbe</HI> from thequin. towards the north pole, thereto I place the <HI>Finitor</HI> with his almicant. downewards towards the &s;outh pole, becau&s;e the latit. of &Venus; was &s;outh: the a&s;cendent then by the 3. booke 42.

I being nowe in Glo&s;ter &s;hire in the Chri&s;t|ma&s;&s;e time with the good knight and my deare vncle Syr Iohn Hungerforde, who departed this worlde the 19. of March, Anno 1582. there chaunced a great &s;now a day or two before, and therewithall followed ri|mie dayes, by which meanes although there were no cloudes to be &s;eene in the whole &s;kie, yet by rea&s;on of the rimie thinne vapours that did hang in the lower region of the aire that much brake the force of the &s;unne beames, I did perceiue the &s;unne, the moone, and Venus who then was betweene the &Sun; and &Moon;, all three of them at two of the clocke in the afternoone the &s;ame day: or rather &s;omwhat before, and &s;o all the day af|ter, which I &s;hewed there to diuer&s;e of my friends and kin&s;men which were there as I was, to pa&s;&s;e the time with that wor&s;hipfull knight, who&s;e ho&s;pitalitie was mo&s;t bountifull. Wherefore admitte the tenth of October 1580. were &s;ome &s;uch like day, if you will graunt no ab&s;urditie, and that then I had taken the alti|tude of &Venus; 31 &frac13; deg. and her azimuth 79 &frac12; at 10. of the clocke &s;hee being to &s;ight Ea&s;twards of the <HI>Nonage&s;simus gradus</HI> and woulde thereby knowe her longitude and latitude, which to doe, I lay the degree of &Sun; videlicet &Libra; 27. degrees 8. minutes vnto 10. of the clocke in the <HI>Limbe,</HI> where I finde the a&s;cendent &Scorp; 29 &frac12;, his ampli|tude 33 &frac12;, the <HI>Nonage&s;simus gradus</HI> &Leo; 29 &frac12;, his altitude 46. by which I &s;et the <HI>Finitor</HI> to the con&s;titution of the 16.

<P>_A Quadrant is in briefe the quarter of a circle, encluded with two &s;emidiame|ters, as you &s;ee here this figure ABC. The arch thereof, vz. BC, I call the <HI>Limbe</HI> which is deuided as the order is, into 90. degr. The &s;emidiameter erected, vz. BA is the &s;ide of the quadrant, the other &s;emidiameter, vz. AC is the groundline or ba&s;e of the quadrant, from which the <HI>Limbe</HI> beginneth to be numbred, vz. from C towards B.</P>
<P>An arch in Latine <HI>Arcus,</HI> is any porcion of the circumference or rynge of a circle, as here, BO, OP, PD, BC, &amp;c.</P>
<P>A Chorde in Latine <HI>Chorda,</HI> is as it were the diameter to the arche, or the &s;tring to the bow, as here the &s;treight line BGP, is the chorde of the arch BOP, and the line DC of the arche DC.</P>
<P>The Complement of an arch in Latine <HI>Complementum arcus,</HI> is that portion of a circle, which any arch lacketh of a quadrant or 90. degrees, as the com|plement of the arch BD is the arch DC, and the compleme~t of DC, is BD. So that alwayes the arche and his complement make a quadrant.</P>

<P>A Syne in Latine <HI>Sinus,</HI> is a &s;treight line commen&s;urable ey|ther in length or power vnto the diameter of a circle, and to be mea&s;ured by his parts.</P>
<P>The Syne totall in Latine <HI>Sinus totus,</HI> is the &s;ide or ba&s;e of the quadrant, as AB, or AC, deuided into an 100. equall parts at the lea&s;t, but rather into a 1000. 10000. or 100000. parts for the more the better.</P>
<P>A right Syne in Latine <HI>Sinus rectus,</HI> is anye perpendicular fal|ling from the arch or <HI>Limbe</HI> of the quadrant on his ba&s;e, as here you &s;ee DF is the right Syne of the arch DC, and OM of OC, and is denominated of tho&s;e parts of the Syne total, whi|che he contayneth or more briefly a right Syne is halfe the cord of any arch doubled, as the right Syne of BO is the line BG.</P>
<P>A backe Syne in Latine <HI>Sinus ver&s;us,</HI> is any perpendicular fal|ling from the arch or <HI>Limbe</HI> of the quadrant on his &s;ide, as you &s;ee DE, which is called the backe &s;ine of the arch DC. By thi you may &s;ee and learne if you marke it, that the backe Syne of any arch, is the right Syne of the &s;ame arches complement, for DE is the backe Syne of the arch DC, but it is the right Syne of BD. VVherefore in briefe, a backe Syne is halfe the chorde of the arches complement doubled.</P>
<P>The Supplement of a Syne is that which any Syne lacketh of the quadrantes &s;ide or Syne totall, as BE is the &s;upplement of the right Syne FD, or AE, which is equall vnto it: likewi&s;e FC is the &s;upplement of the backe Syne ED, for ED and FC make the Syne totall.</P>
<P>Note that &s;ome Authors make but three di&s;tinctions of Synes, as I haue here done, vz. <HI>totus rectus</HI> &amp; <HI>ver&s;us,</HI> O|ther &s;ome as namely <HI>Apian</HI> and <HI>Mun&s;ter</HI> make foure, vz. <HI>Sinus totus,</HI> then <HI>Sinus rectus primus,</HI> which here I call the right Syne, and <HI>Sinus rectus &s;ecundus,</HI> which I call the backe Syne, and then <HI>Sinus ver&s;us</HI> to be that which I call the Supplement of the backe Syne, videl. FC, being as the arrow to the bow: but truely I like not thereof, and therefore I haue thought good to call both FC and EB Supplementes as before, for if &s;o be that FC be <HI>Sinus ver&s;us,</HI> then may EB be as wel <HI>Sinus ver&s;us &s;ecundus.</HI> The matter is not great for the names, &s;o you vnder&s;tand the

</FIGURE> chapter, get the &s;ide BC, yet without any exact certaintie, becau&s;e the angle A is &s;o lit|tle, and that the &s;ide BC, wyll fall out to bee but certaine minutes, whiche except your <HI>Iewell</HI> be mon&s;trous cannot be di&s;cerned any thing neere. To helpe this you &s;hall in&s;teed of one degree tenne minutes, whiche are 70. minutes in the whole, reckon on the <HI>Limbe</HI> of your <HI>Iewel</HI> from the Equinoctiall vpwardes 7. degrees, and thereto lay the rule as in the nienth chapter, for &s;o doth euery degree of the <HI>limb</HI> repre&s;ent 10. minutes. In this ca&s;e then, as in the 9. reckon on the rule from the center, the &s;ide AB, vz. 15, degrees, and there &s;hall you finde the 14 6/7. meridian to cut, who&s;e degrees betweene the cro&s;sng of the rule, and the Equinoctiall are 2 &frac15;. degrees, the &s;ide BE, after the 9. chapter. But here you mu&s;t allowe each degree, but 10. minutes, as you did at the <HI>limbe,</HI> &s;o that this 2 &frac15;. deg. repre&s;ent but 22. minutes, &s;o much is the &s;ide BC. And in this working you mu&s;t in no wi&s;e exceede 10 or 15. deg. in the <HI>Limbe</HI> at the mo&s;t, yea and that where the angle propo&s;ed exceedeth not two degrees, for in the&s;e &s;mall or minute angles, as I may terme them, there is kept a Geometricall propor|tion betwene the parts of the triangle, whiche in greater, the nature of the &s;pheare alloweth not: neither yet in the&s;e, but that the error is vn&s;en&s;ible, this helpe did Gemma Fri&s;ius inuent, as in my 3. booke 56. chapter appeareth, from whom I woulde be loth to derogate: but in my next edition I will &s;upply it farre better, &amp; more exact, by another deui&s;e euen vnto 30. degrees, which heere you can &s;cant extend to three degrees.</P>

<P>THis propo&s;ition had I once half giue~ ouer as vnpo&s;sible on my <HI>Iewell,</HI> which made me greatly to mi&s;like him: but in re&s;pect hee made mee amendes in perfourming another that Regiomont. left impos&s;ible, as by the fifteen chapter appeareth, I thought it a le&s;&s;e fault, yet &s;till where&s;oeuer I went or &s;ate alone, I coulde not choo&s;e but be deui&s;ing vppon it: and at la&s;t while I was abroad, in my eueninges walke, whiche I commonly v&s;ed, it came into my head on the &s;odaine, but then was it no neede too bidde me trudge a pace home to my <HI>Iewel</HI> to &s;ee it in experience. All the skill thereof is too make the right angle too lye among the cro&s;singes of the meridianes and azimuthes within the <HI>limbe</HI> in maner as the one angle of all triangles, not right angled doth, &s;o that when the con&s;titution of the triangle is founde on the <HI>Ie|well</HI> his &s;ide, which lyeth on the <HI>Limbe</HI> betweene the Zenith, and the pole may be the &s;ide &s;ubtending the right angle giuen: which you &s;hall thus do.

</FIGURE> Let there be pro|po&s;ed the right angled &s;phearicall triangle ABC, who&s;e three angles are giuen vz. C. 69. degrees, B 55. and A 90. I reckon one of the angles not right, vz. 69. among the azimuthes of my <HI>Iewell,</HI> and the other vz. 55. among the meridianes alwayes counted from the <HI>limbe:</HI> this done, all the mi&s;terie of this matter is, how in turning a|bout the <HI>Reete</HI> to know when this 69. azimuth, and 55. meridian doe cro&s;&s;e another &s;quare, which can neuer be by the 3. def &amp; 3. theoreme except they cut one anothers poles, which poles I may ea&s;ily know where to finde by the 12. theoreme. By which I &s;ay that the poles of euerie meridian of my <HI>Iewell</HI> are to be found in the Equinocti|all line, and not els where. For as it is apparaunt by the third def. and the third theoreme, that the pole or poles of the vttermo&s;t meridian, beeing the innermo&s;t cir|cle of the <HI>limbe,</HI> lyeth in the Equinoctiall line, in the center of the <HI>Iewel:</HI> So looke how muche euery other meridian lyeth within the <HI>limbe</HI> on the one hand, euen as much doth one of his poles lye di&s;taunte from the center on the other hande. As for ex|ample, the pole of the fifth meridian, next the <HI>limbe</HI> on the South part, is the 5. degree of the Equinoctial line from the center towardes the North parte, and &s;o of all the re&s;t, as in my fourth book and fourth chap|ter doth al&s;o appeare, yet thus much more plainely cho&s;e out any meridian who&s;e pole you require, then reckon from him on the Equinoctiall line towardes the center, and beyonde till you come to 90. degrees, and there &s;hall bee his pole: as for example, if from the fift meridian on the South part next the <HI>Limbe,</HI> you count on the Equino|ctiall Northwardes 90. degrees, the &s;ame &s;hal end at 5. de. beyond y^e center, this matter now I hope is plain enough for you to gather that in the very like maner the poles of all the azimuthes are to bee founde in the <HI>Finitor,</HI> and not els where, wherefore to goe forwards with our triangle you &s;hall by the rules heere la&s;t mentioned, reckon on the <HI>Finitor</HI> from the 69.

<P>I Haue hytherto for the plea&s;ure &amp; delight of the learner, &s;et downe diuers A&s;tronomicall que&s;tions, and conclu&s;ions to be re&s;olued by the&s;e triangles in &s;undrie chapters before: lea&s;t otherwi&s;e, if I &s;hould haue gi|uen the bare preceptes, as Regiomontanus and others haue done, this work beyng of all the re&s;t mo&s;t pro|fitble might happily haue been neglected, &amp; thought on the fir&s;t blu&s;h of &s;mall account: knowing that no|thing draweth on mens minds more to any &s;tudie the~ that they may at the fir&s;t entrance perceiue their rules to &s;erue to good purpo&s;e. And as I haue hitherto touched a fewe &s;leight que&s;tions: &s;o might I haue witten a number, and therewith filled great volumes, the matter beeing in manner endles, were it not that I both ha&s;t the end of my trauaile too too long alreadie looked for of diuers of my familiars, and pre&s;ume that by tho&s;e, any man may performe all other that be of no greater waight. But now there are in like maner an in|finite number of intricate que&s;tions more harder far then any yet propounded, which by Regiomont. Co|pernicus, and others doctrine, grow to great toile with their Synes, calculations, &amp; proportions, wherin fir&s;t they hunt about for one Syne, which they call <HI>inuentum primum,</HI> then for another, which they call <HI>inuentum &s;e|cundum,</HI> &amp; co~monly <HI>inuentum tertium,</HI> &amp; perhaps <HI>quartum,</HI> &amp; &s;o foorth.

<P>The 14. day of October 1582. about 6. a clock in the morning, &amp; 30. min. pa&s;t, &s;eeing the morning cleer &amp; &Mars;, &Earth;, &amp; the Moone all 3. aboue our horrizon, according to my accu&s;tomed maner, I could not choo&s;e but haue a ca&s;t at them for my recreation, wherefore with a large cro&s;&s;e &s;taffe that I had made after my fa&s;hion, as in my next edition I will &s;hew, I tooke the di&s;tance between Mars &amp; the great Star in the right &s;houlder of Orion, &amp; found it 31. deg. 37 &frac12;. min. Likewi&s;e the &s;ame in&s;tant I took the di&s;tance between &Mars;, &amp; y^e Nor|thermo&s;t of the 2. &s;tars of &Gemini;, called Apollo, &amp; fou~d that 10, de. 25. mi. &Mars; being orient. of the~ both.

But now the better to conceaue howe to
<PB N="91" REF="54"> bring this matter to pa&s;&s;e, my be&s;t way is fir&s;t to make a &s;light pattern of the thing I pretende in this maner: I make a circle at aduenture, vz. AB, CD, who&s;e diametre AB, &s;hall repre&s;ent the Ecliptike, the point C, beeing his North pole, and D the South: this done, I goe to Stadius Tables, and there I finde the longitude of the &s;aid &s;tar of Orion, 23. deg. 0. min. in &Gemini;, his latitude, 17. deg. 0. min. South of the Ecliptick, and the lon|gitude of Apollo 14. deg. 20. min. in &Cancer;, his latitude 9. degrees 40. min. Northwards: this knowen, I appoint the arche CAD, to bee the circle of Orions longitude: that is to &s;ay, the great circle of the &s;pheare, cutting the 23 0. of &Gemini; i&s;&s;uing from the Ecliptickes poles, then taking 23. 0 of &Gemini; out of 14.20. in &Cancer;. there re&s;teth 21, deg. 20. min. for whiche I ame out a portion of the Eclipticke AB, containing by e&s;timation 21 &frac13;. &s;uch partes as AF, containeth 90. vz. AE, and then opening my co~pa&s;&s;e I draw the arch or &s;emicircle CED, which is the circle of Apolloes longitude, vz. of the 14. 20 of &Cancer;.
<FIGURE>
<FIGDESC>geometrical diagram</FIGDESC>
</FIGURE> After this from A towardes D, I ame 17. &s;uche partes as AE, containethe 21 &frac13;. or AF, 90. and there I &s;et M, or make a &s;tarre, for there is the place of Apollo, according to his lon|gitude and latitude, then in the arch CED, fro~ E towards the North pole D, I &s;et by ame 9 &frac23;. of &s;uch like partes being the latitude of Orion, vz. in N: and &s;o are the&s;e knowen &s;tarres placed: which done, I open my compa&s;&s;e as neere as I can ge&s;&s;e to 31. degrees 37 &frac12;. min. of &s;uch like parts, vz. the di&s;tance taken by the cro&s;&s;e &s;taffe betweene Orion and &Mars;, and &s;et the one foote in Orion, vz. M and with the other make a blinde arche cutting the Eclipticke AB, towardes the center: that is to &s;ay, with the &s;equele of the &s;ignes, for that &Mars; was orientall. Againe I take 10 25/60. lyke partes by ge&s;&s;e, al&s;o in my co~pa&s;&s;e: that is to &s;ay, the di&s;tance taken be|twene Apollo &amp; &Mars;, &amp; &s;etting the one foot in Apollo, vz.

Then with my compa&s;&s;e at the width of AF at the lea&s;t, I draw the arches MN, MO, and NO, but with no great curio&s;itie: la&s;tly I drawe the arche COD, which is the circle of the longitude of &Mars;, and then is my platforme laid, whereupon I de&s;cant in this manner.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t to begin with CA, the &s;ame is 90. de. and AM, 17. the latitude of Orion: therefore CAM is 107. al&s;o CE is 90. degrees by the &s;econd def. and NE, but 9. degrees 40. min, the latitude of Apollo: therefore taking NE, out of CE, there re&s;teth CN, 79. deg. 20. minutes. Al&s;o the angle MCN, being the difference of Orion and Apolloes longitude is knowen to bee 21. degrees 20. minutes by the 4. def. Therefore nowe hauing two &s;ides of the &s;phearicall triangle MNC, vz. MC, 107. and NC, 79. 20/60. encluding the knowen angle MCN, 21 20/60. degrees, you &s;hal ea&s;ily by the 13. chap. find both the 3. &s;ide MN, to be 34 &frac23;. deg. and al&s;o the angle CMN, to be 39 &frac13;. Then haue you the triangle MNO, of all three &s;ides knowen. vz. MN. 34 &frac23;. NO, 10 25/60. and OM 31. degrees. 37 &frac12;. min. VVherefore by the the 11. chapter you &s;hall ea&s;ily finde the angle NMO to be 17 &frac12;. deg. which added to the angle CMN, vz. 39 &frac13;. maketh 57. almo&s;t the quantitie of the angle CMO, and yet you will &s;ay, what am I the neere for all this. Soft a while, not too fa&s;t for falling: nowe are you pa&s;t your <HI>Inuentum primum &amp; &s;ecundum,</HI> which in Synicall workyng, perhaps would haue myred you twi&s;e ere this, &amp; yet you &s;cant half way ouer.

CMO, who&s;e two &s;ides CM, 107. and <HI>M</HI>O, 31. deg. 37 &frac12;. min. are knowen, containing the knowen angle CMO, 57. degrees: wherefore by the 13. chapter you &s;hall ea&s;ily finde the &s;ide CO, 88 &frac34;. degrees, which take~ out of CP, vz. 90. leueth OP. 1 &frac14;. degrees, the latitude of &Mars;. You &s;hall likewi&s;e by the 13. find the quantitie of the angle MCO, 26. degrees, which is the difference of longitude of &Mars; from the &s;aid great &s;tar of Orion, and in reckoning forwardes according to the &s;equele of the &s;ignes: that is &s;ay, from the 23. de. of &Gemini; being the longitude of Orion 26. degrees forwardes on the Eclipticke, falleth out too bee the 19, degrees of &Cancer;, the longitude of &Mars; de&s;ired: and &s;o is this bu&s;ie matter at the la&s;t brought too good pa&s;&s;e by the &s;in|guler v&s;e &amp; help of &s;phearicall triangles, &amp; thus &s;hal you be able to performe any other matter of the &s;phere what&s;oeuer, for you &s;hall not lightly finde any que&s;tion &s;o harde, but if you once drawe your platfourme you &s;hall deui&s;e how to adde &s;ome arches or angles, yeelding &s;ufficient helpe too accompli&s;h your pretence, and many times after you are a little exerci&s;ed, you &s;hall &s;et your platfourme more expre&s;ly by the lineame~ts of your <HI>Iewel,</HI> then with your pen, <HI>V&s;us promptos facit, foemina ludificantur viros:</HI> but tarry, I had almo&s;t forgot the de|clination and right a&s;cen&s;ion of &Mars;, for which you had neede make another platfourme, as heere you &s;ee A<HI>B</HI>CD, is the great circle or colure cutting the ecliptikes poles GH, and the poles of the worlde AB, CD: the Equinoctiall KL, the ecliptick RS, the circle of Mars his latitude, and GOPH, of his longitude: GA. is the di&s;ta~ce of the clip. poles fro~ <HI>y^e</HI> poles of <HI>y^e</HI> world vz. 23 &frac12;. deg.

Now haue you the &s;phearical triangle GAO, who&s;e &s;ide GA, 23 &frac12;. and GO, 79 &frac23;. are knowen containing the angle AGO, being the difference of longitude of &Mars; from the beginning of &Cancer;, vz. 19. deg. wherefore by the 13. you may ea&s;ily get the &s;ide AO, and the angle GAO, which had, take AO, out of AX, being 90. leaueth OX, the declination of &Mars;, then take the angle GAO, out of CAD, vz. 180. it leaueth the angle DAX, the difference of the right a&s;cen&s;ion between &Mars;, and 0. in &Cancer;, &s;o that the right a&s;cen&s;ion of &Cancer;, being alwayes 90. of Mars, it was more at that time by the arch DX.</P>

<P>_HOw profitable, how plea&s;ant, &amp; how nece&s;&s;ary dials are, there is none &s;o &s;imple a &s;oule but &s;eeth it, neither any I thinke &s;o &s;otti&s;h to &s;ay again&s;t it, &s;ince no order could be kept in things, if di&s;tinctio~ of times were not. For what is the co~&s;eruation, grace, &amp; vpholding of all good ordinances, but euery thing to be done in his due houres. The trauailer by land is not a lit+tle co~forted, whe~ he may with a &s;mall toy &s;ee how the day goeth away before him: and al&s;o may &s;ee to what place he may reach before nyght o|uertake him. The Seama~ without dials, or &s;uch like in&s;trume~ts to know their houres and times, coulde not trauaile at all. Chir&s;te him&s;elfe made often mention of houres and times. Therefore &s;ince their commodities are &s;o manife&s;t, no doubt but the inuentours were much to be accounted of, and the inuention highly to bee e&s;teemed. Some will &s;ay what then? VVhy &s;hould wee nowe bee troubled with more bookes thereof, &s;ince &s;o many are alreadie extant, a man may haue too much of his mothers ble&s;|&s;ing. But yet &s;ir, if you will follow mee, I may happily leade you a plea&s;ant path, where others are &s;tumbled with many a &s;tile, and were it not that my worke doth for ea&s;e &s;peede, and plaine&s;&s;e excell all the authours that euer wrote heereof, yet woulde I not leaue it out, becau&s;e it wonderfully &s;etteth foorth the &s;inguler ver|tue and efficacie of my <HI>Iewell,</HI> which as I haue often &s;ayd, &amp; manife&s;tly &s;hewed, will needes &s;upply all v&s;es of A&s;tronomie. For as hee hath in the la&s;t booke made &s;mooth all the rockie intricacie of &s;phearicall trian|gles: &s;o heere with no le&s;&s;e &s;ingularitie he expre&s;&s;eth the making of tho&s;e Dials, which all other Authours haue left lyke a Labyrinth to the learner, as if you reade Mun&s;ter Oro~tius and others, and e&s;pecially Andre|as Sconerus, of declining or reclining Dials, you will confe&s;&s;e. VVherefore I doubt no but this woorke of myne &s;hall bee both acceptable too the be&s;t, &amp; longed for of the re&s;t, of which I am too prepo&s;e the&s;e pream|bles following.</P>
<P N="1">1 The whole Globe of the earth in compari&s;on to the circuit of the &s;peere, wherein the &s;unne is carried
<PB N="93" REF="55"> eareth a very &s;mall bigne&s;&s;e, but a centre pricke to &s;peake of, and in re&s;pect of the other heigher, as the 8. 9 and 10. &s;peeres, it carieth no acount at all. For which cau&s;e all Dials are made, euen as though we dwelt in the centre of the earth. And betweene a flat heere on the circuit of the earth, and a flat cutting the centre of the earth, &s;o they be parallel, there is no difference in this behalfe.</P>
<P N="2">2 All plaine flats what&s;oeuer and how&s;oeuer they decline, recline, or incline, doe repre&s;ent &s;ome one ho|rizon in the world.</P>
<P N="3">3 Euerie Horizon what&s;oeuer, repre&s;enteth a great circle of the &s;phere by his definition.</P>
<P N="4">4 Euerie great circle hath his two poles, euen as thequinoctiall hath by the 2. definition.</P>
<P N="5">5 The poles of any horizon are his zenith, and his Nadir.</P>
<P N="6">6 But to auoyd confu&s;ion of vnder&s;tanding henceforth in this worke of Dyals, when I &s;hall &s;peake of the pole or poles, I will meane onely the pole or poles of the world.</P>
<P N="7">7 And when I &s;peake of the Zenith or Nadir, I will meane it &s;implie for the Horizon of the place wher|of I &s;peake, as the common order of &s;peech is.</P>
<P N="8">8 And for that the poles of any Horizon repre&s;ented by any wall, bancke or flatte what&s;oeuer, are in truth the Zenith and Nadir of the &s;ame horizon, therefore I will call the vppermo&s;t the pole Zenith, and the vn|dermo&s;t the pole Nadir of any &s;uch horizon, wall, bancke or flatte.</P>
<P N="9">9 Euery Flat what&s;oeuer imagined hath two faces, as I may call them, on ech &s;ide one, as in a Counter, (which though it be a &s;olide and &s;orie <HI>&s;imile</HI>) the one face is cro&s;&s;e, the other pile.</P>
<P N="10">10 In euery great circle there is a flat to be imagined of two faces, or two flats I might &s;ay, re&s;pecting &s;e|uerall parts of the heauens: as for example, If you imagine a flat in thequinoctiall circle, the &s;ame &s;hall haue two faces, the one re&s;pecting the North Pole, the other the South Pole.</P>
<P N="11">11 You &s;hall finde no great circle of the Sphere how&s;oeuer imagined, but that looke how much the north pole is eleuated aboue his one flat, &s;o much is the &s;outh pole eleuated aboue his other flat, or rather depre&s;&s;ed, to &s;peake it more aptly to my purpo&s;e, and &s;o contrariwi&s;e, which on your <HI>Iewel</HI> you may mo&s;t euidently &s;ee. For placing the <HI>Finitor</HI> to our latitude vz. 51 &frac23; degrees fixed vnder the north pole, you &s;hall &s;treight &s;ee the &s;outh pole depre&s;&s;ed 51 &frac23; deg. vnder the <HI>Finitor,</HI> which is the eleuation of the &s;outh pole to tho&s;e people which be Antypodes to vs, an &s;o forth in any other latitude.</P>
<P N="12">12 Sythens euery flat what&s;oeuer repre&s;enteth &s;ome one horizon in the worlde, and euerie horizon &s;ome one great circle of the &s;phere, as is before &s;aide: therefore euerie flat not being a right horizon, lieth in &s;ome one great circle, aboue which one of the poles is eleuated, hauing al&s;o an other Antypodall flatte imagined on the back&s;ide, vnto which the other pole is as much depre&s;&s;ed, or to &s;peake it Antypodally I may &s;ay ele|uated: for you mu&s;t note that euery right horizon hath neither pole eleuated as &s;halbe &s;hewed.</P>
<P N="13">13 In euerie latitude you &s;hall finde both the poles to be eleuated aboue the flats of the Verticall circle, or Ea&s;t Azimuth (which repre&s;enteth alwayes the North and South wals) as much as the latitude lacketh of 90. As for example, &s;et the <HI>Finitor</HI> to our latitude videlicet 51 &frac23;: you &s;hall &s;ee that the zenith line which alwayes repre&s;enteth the &s;aid verticall circle hath the North pole eleuated 38 &frac12; deg. aboue his one flatte, and the &s;outh pole as much aboue his other flat.</P>
<P N="14">14 Note that when you finde this word (Latitude) &s;implie in this 6. Booke, I meane the Latitude of the place where you remaine, and that to all other walles and flats, I will v&s;e this word Eleuation, or poles Eleua|tion for di&s;tinctions &s;ake.</P>
<P N="15">15 Al&s;o I wil v&s;e this word Horizon &s;implie but to the place of your biding, the re&s;t I wil cal wals or flats when as I meane the Horizons or great circles repre&s;ented by them.</P>

<HEAD><HI>Chapter 2.</HI> Of the di&s;tinction on Dials into two kinds, In&s;trumentall and Sphericall.</HEAD>
<P>THe &s;hapes, formes, fa&s;hions, and deui&s;es for Dials are very many in generall: yet in particular they are but of two &s;orts, for either they are made to de&s;crie the houre by the altitude of the &s;unne, of which &s;ort are Quadrants, Rings, Circles, Shippes, Cilinders, and &s;uch like: and therefore rather to be called in&s;truments then Dials: Or el&s;e they are to &s;hew the houre by the &s;hade of a cocke, &s;tile, or Gnomon without re&s;pect of &s;unnes altitude, of which &s;ort are your common Horizontall and Murall Dials of all &s;orts: your portable Dials with needles: your Equinoctiall, your conuex, concaue, and &s;uch like.</P>
<P>Of the fir&s;t &s;ort the deui&s;es are &s;o manifolde, which euerie learned A&s;tronomer may and hath deui&s;ed to his fancie, that a great volume would not contane them. VVherefore &s;ince they be troble&s;ome and bu&s;ie to make, and being made &s;eldome &s;erue but to one latitude, and withall cannot be v&s;ed but of the learned &s;ort: I do not meane to entreate any whit of them, but will &s;et ouer tho&s;e that are de&s;irous of &s;uch fancies vnto Mun&s;ter, &amp; Orontius <HI>de horologiis:</HI> to Apian, who hath made a bu&s;ie Horo&s;cope: to Sconer, not inferiour to any of them: to Stophler, and &s;uch ancient writers, where they &s;hall &s;ee deui&s;e ynough to werie them. And the rather I omitte the&s;e in&s;trumentall Dials, becau&s;e all their v&s;es are farre more reddily performed by my <HI>Iewel:</HI> Yet knowne that the vnder&s;tanding of my <HI>Iewel,</HI> &s;hall cau&s;e any man almo&s;t at the fir&s;t in&s;pection to make any of them: for the onely and chiefe&s;t matter in their fabrication dependeth on the knowing of the Sunnes true altitude for euery houre through the yeare: which by my 3. Booke 31. Chap. is had for the looking on. And &s;o I leaue all Dials of that &s;ort, to them that like better of them then euer I did. For I neuer loued to ca|rie a Diall about me, whereon I mu&s;t bee driuen to hunt after the houre when I had neede of him: which minde of mine, was the onely cau&s;e that made me to deui&s;e the furniture of the <HI>Iewel</HI> as you &s;ee: For that as I haue often &s;aid by Gemma Fri&s;ius, Regula, Cur&s;or, and Brachiolum, I could get nothing without hunting after it, and &s;omtimes the Cur&s;or led me &s;uch a cour&s;e that I haue beene faine to giue ouer the cha&s;e, or not fully pur&s;ued it to the very point. Thus much of in&s;trumentall Dials. The &s;econd &s;ort which are more aptlie called Dials, I meane at large to pro&s;ecute in this volume, becau&s;e they depende altogither <HI>Ex protractione Spe|rica,</HI>

<HEAD><HI>Chapter 3.</HI> Of the definition and deriuation of Dyals and the grounde of them all.</HEAD>
<P>A Dyall in verie trueth, might be called a plaine &s;phere: but onely that it wanteth parallels: for the lines drawne thereon to di&s;tingui&s;h the houres, are the verie meridians or hourelines of the &s;phere pro&s;pe|ctiuely proiected on a plaine <HI>Superficies,</HI> by the Sunnes acce&s;&s;e vnto them: as here following I wil as much as I can, make manife&s;t, bicau&s;e the mo&s;t part will hardly beleeue it. But fir&s;t to define an oblique Dyall which chiefely commeth in que&s;tion more artifically: An oblique Dyall is mo&s;t commonly a rounde <HI>Superficies</HI> or flatte, lying equiballance to &s;ome one horizon, concentricke to his circumference, from who&s;e centre, i&s;&s;ue out certaine &s;treight lines, vnto the inter&s;ections of euerie 15. meridian or houreline of the &s;phere with the Horizon: cutting al&s;o the circuite of the &s;ame Dyall flatte, into like and proportionable parts vnto the &s;aide inter&s;ections of the Horizon. For the plainer demon&s;tration of this definition, take my <HI>Iewel</HI> in your hand and &s;et the <HI>Finitor</HI> to thequinoctiall, which repre&s;enteth an Horizon where one of the poles is Zenith: now if in this horizon you imagine a rounde plate to make a Dyall on: the &s;ame mu&s;t needs be equiballance, and con|centricke, both to thequinoctiall and <HI>Finitor,</HI> becau&s;e they are in this con&s;titution of the &s;phere all one circle: and for as much as the parallels grow le&s;&s;e and le&s;&s;e, euen vnto nothing at the pole, and that the pole is here the zenith, therefore it mu&s;t needes be that &s;ome one of the&s;e parallels is equall and equidi&s;tant, to this round plate for your Dyall, &s;o that a perpendiculer line let downe from the zenith or pole, &s;hall cut the centres both of the Horizon, parallel, and plate. Then who knoweth not that thequinoctiall, and likewi&s;e all the parallels are deuided into 360. equall parts by the meridians of the &s;phere, of which 360. the 24. part is 15. therefore euery 15. meridian are commonly called hourelines. The&s;e hourelines (or rather &s;pherically called houre circles) doe nowe deuide the <HI>Finitor</HI> in this con&s;titution into 24. equall and euen parts: wherefore if you imagine 24. lines i&s;&s;uing from the centre of the <HI>Finitor,</HI> (which is al&s;o the centre of the Dyall plate, and repre&s;ented here by the centre of the <HI>Iewel</HI>) vnto the 24. inter&s;ections of the &s;aid houre circles with the <HI>Finitor:</HI> they &s;hall deuide the Dyall plate into 24. equall parts, becau&s;e the inter&s;ections in this horizon are equall, e|uen as the parallel that &s;tandeth directly ouer the plate is deuided: &s;o that by this definition you may con|clude that a Dyall, made to that Horizon, where the pole is zenith, is onely a circle deuided into 24. equall parts which is called an equinoctiall Dyall.</P>
<P>As this demon&s;tration is mo&s;t manife&s;t in the equinoctiall Horizon, where the &s;aide 15. meridians cut the Horizon into 24. equall parts: &s;o falleth it out plaine ynough in any other horizon, where one of the poles is eleuated aboue the &s;ame otherwi&s;e how&s;oeuer. For euery &s;uch Horizon, is al&s;o deuided by tho&s;e &s;elfe&s;ame 24. meridians, into 24. partes, but vnequall: and by how much le&s;&s;e the pole is eleuated, the more vnequall they are. For demon&s;tration whereof, &s;et the <HI>Finitor</HI> of the <HI>Iewel,</HI> vnto our latitude here at Reading, vz. 51 &frac23; deg. vnder the pole.

</FIGURE> Now to &s;ee the proportion of the &s;paces for the hourelines of a Dyall to the &s;ame Hori|zon, marke how the 15. prickt meridians or houre circles of the <HI>Iewel,</HI> doe cut the <HI>Finitor,</HI> for if you tell the degrees on the <HI>Finitor,</HI> be|tweene ech cutting you &s;hall haue thereon the degrees &s;eruing to the &s;euerall di&s;tances of the hourelines of your Dyall, &s;o that if as before, you &s;ituate in this horizon, a rounde plate for your Dyall, the &s;ame &s;hall be con|centricke thereto, and equall to one of the Almicantares, which grow le&s;&s;e and le&s;&s;e to nothing at the zenith, euen as the parallels do at the pole, wherefore if from the centre of your plate you imagine 24. lines i&s;&s;uing vnto the inter&s;ections at the worlds end, as they &s;ay, of the 24. houre circles with the <HI>Finitor,</HI> they &s;hal cut the round plate into 24. like vnequall parts vnto tho&s;e, made on the horizon or <HI>Finitor</HI> in all re&s;pects proportio|nably an Symitrially agreeing, &s;o that whi|ther your Dyall plate be great or little, his diui&s;ions are proportionable.</P>
<P>For better explanation heereof vnto the young learners: admit that you had 24. wyers, of equal length, made iu&s;t &s;emicircle|wi&s;e, and all of them ioyned at two points or poles: the&s;e 24. wyers being &s;et ech of like di&s;tance from o|ther, would make 12. whole circles: whereof you might appoint any one of them for the meridian circle, then if you did prepare a round plate, or thinne boorde, with a hole in the centre, of equall circuit to one of the&s;e 12. wyer circles, and did put him within the&s;e wyers, like a bird in a kage, but &s;o that the one pole where the&s;e wyers meete, might be iu&s;t 51 &frac23; deg. reckoned on the meridian wyer aboue this plate, and the other pole as much vnder: and la&s;tly thru&s;t a &s;treight wyer through both the &s;ame poles, &amp; the centre of the
<PB N="95" REF="56"> plate, as in this figure appeareth: you haue a plaine ocular demon&s;tration of the grounde and rea&s;on of all Dyals, for if now you fa&s;ten a threede at the centre of the plate, to the axtree line: or el&s;e a ruler, and lay the &s;ame from place to place, where the 24. wyers do touch the round plate, you may thereby drawe the houre lines for your Dyall, as many as &s;hall &s;erue your turne, as I haue done in this figure, which hath but 12. houre circles, or wyers here repre&s;ented, becau&s;e the whole 24. could not wel be drawne, but the other 12. you mu&s;t imagine to lie &s;o oppo&s;ite and directly one to another, that euery one hideth his match. Now if you place this plate within the wyers, neere or farther off from the pole, according to the latitude of any countrie what&s;oeuer: you may thereby make a Dyall thereunto. So that a man might make a pretie in&s;trument of 24. wyers, to make all manner of Dyals by, if there were no other &s;hift, but you &s;hall haue my <HI>Iewel</HI> about you when the wyers will be to &s;eeke, neither can the wyers be exactly bent true compa&s;&s;e, nor being bent, keepe their iu&s;t places long.</P>

<HEAD><HI>Chapter 4.</HI> What the cocke or Gnomon of euery Dyall is, and by what rea&s;on they giue the true &s;hade to the Dyall.</HEAD>
<P>FIr&s;t you &s;hall vnder&s;tande that the cocke, Stile, or <HI>Gnomon</HI> of euery Dyall, I meane the line thereof that yeldeth the &s;hade to know the houres by, lyeth directly in the axtreeline of the world, or at the lea&s;t, pa|rallel vnto him, which worketh the &s;ame effect.</P>
<P>Secondly I &s;hewed in the la&s;t Chapt. that the &s;phere is &s;et about with 360. houre circles, meeting at the poles: which maketh 24. times 15. whereby the &s;pace of time, wherein the &Sun; commeth vnto euery of the&s;e 15. by the motion of the <HI>Primum mobile,</HI> or fir&s;t mouer about the axtree of the worlde, maketh one houre: So that an houre is the 24. part of this reuolution once about. The&s;e 24. houre circles of the &s;phere are repre|&s;ented in the la&s;t Chapter, by 24. wyers, of which, euery one is &s;o directly oppo&s;ite to his match again&s;t him, that they both make one whole circle. In&s;omuch that of the 24. houre circles, or rather &s;emicircles, (as they are in deede) there are made 12. whole circles, meeting and cro&s;sing ech other in halfe at the poles: wherefore of nece&s;sitie the axtree mu&s;t needes be dyametre to them all by the fir&s;t definition, and fir&s;t <HI>Theoreme</HI> of the fifte Booke. This knowne, I thinke there is no man &s;o ignorant, but may conceiue without the 22. Theoreme of Euclides pro&s;pectiue: that if a circle with his diametre or axtree, be turned edgelong towards a mans eye, that then it appeareth to &s;ight no circle, but a &s;treight line like vnto AB in this figure.
<FIGURE>
<FIGDESC>geometrical diagram</FIGDESC>
</FIGURE> By this onely pro&s;pe|ctiue rea&s;on it commeth to pa&s;&s;e, that the ax|tree line giueth &s;hade vnto the Dyal. For when the Sunne is in any houre circle, the &s;hadowe of the axtreeline is extended thereby directlie on the houre circle oppo&s;ite to the &s;ame, and by that meanes &s;heweth the houre. As for ex|ample, if you place the in&s;trument of wyers mentioned in the la&s;t Chapt. &s;o that the round plate encluded within them, may &s;tande equi|ballance to the horizon, &amp; the meridian wier, directly North and South, the pole aboue the plate Northwards, in order &s;pherically: you &s;hall then &s;ee that the Sunne being in the me|ridian circle Southwards, &s;hall ca&s;t the &s;hadow of the axtree line directly on the &s;ame meridian Northwards, which is the rea&s;on in all horizon Dyals that haue trianguler cockes, they giue no &s;hade at 12. of the clocke. Likewi&s;e the &s;unne being in the 9. of clocke houreline, ca&s;teth the &s;hade of the axtree line directly on his oppo&s;ite, being the 3. of clocke circle: in &s;o much that in your in&s;trument of wyers, you &s;hall perceiue that at euerie compleate houre, the &s;ame houre wyer with his oppo&s;ite, and the axtree, will all three giue but one &s;treight line for &s;hade, which &s;hall be directly on the houreline, drawne one the rounde plate for the &s;ame houre. In&s;omuch, that by one Dyall exactly made, a verie rude and vnskilfull man may make any like Dyall, if the cocke were &s;et vp to his hande, for at euerie houre his &s;hade will mo&s;t truely expre&s;&s;e the houreline, and &s;o for a &s;hift he might make a Dyall in a day: if the Sunne chaunce not into a cloude: then he mu&s;t tarie the Lords lei&s;ure. This matter is expre&s;&s;ed in the fi|gure of the la&s;t Chapter.</P>

<HEAD><HI>Chapter 5.</HI> Of the diui&s;ion of Horizons, and e&s;pecially into three &s;ortes.</HEAD>
<P>ALthough that euerie lea&s;t declining of anie wall, flatte, bancke, or buttre&s;&s;e, is particulerly a diuer&s;e horizon, by the fir&s;t preamble: and hath a &s;undrie eleuation of one of the poles, or none at all, &s;o that in this &s;en&s;e the horizons be infinite: yet by two other meanes they are brought to a farre le&s;&s;e number: whereof the greate&s;t is 90. and the le&s;&s;er but two. For as in all A&s;tronomicall workings 90. horizons &s;erue through the world, euen as I &s;hewed in the 2. Booke and 21. Chapter, the rea&s;on is, as I there &s;aid, becau&s;e he that coulde go continually vpon one of the poles, &s;hall finde that when the pole is once 90. deg. eleuated, hee then is at the heighe&s;t, euen in the zenith: then let him go on &s;treight he &s;hall &s;ee him &s;inck againe on the other &s;ide of him. So al&s;o in another &s;en&s;e, they make but two differences videl. <HI>Horizon rectus,</HI> and <HI>horizon obliquus,</HI> yet &s;ome make three, which I for di&s;tinction of my Dyals thinke be&s;t of, <HI>vz. Horizon rectus</HI> or <HI>Pola|ris, Aequinoctialis,</HI> and <HI>obliquus. Horizon rectus</HI> or <HI>Polaris</HI> a right or polare Horizon, they will to be where the Aequinoctiall is zenith, and the poles leuell with the Horizon, neither of them appearing aboue:
<PB N="96" REF="57"> and for as much as all the meridians meete at the poles, therefore euerie right Horizon mu&s;t needes be, and lie in one of the meridians, for that there are no circles of the Speere, which haue their pole zenith, and Na|dir in thequinoctial, but onely the meridians as I partly &s;hewed in my 24. Chapter of triang. Wherefore to conclude, euery Ea&s;t or VVe&s;t wall, are right horizons becau&s;e they lie directly with the meridian, and &s;o are any other reclining or inclining wals or flats, cutting either poles, that is to &s;ay aboue which neither pole is eleuated.</P>

<HEAD><HI>Chapter 6.</HI> Of the diui&s;ion of all Dials into three &s;orts, and whie they make &s;hew of greater diuer&s;itie then there is.</HEAD>
<P>IN the la&s;t Chapt. I di&s;tingui&s;hed all horizons into three &s;orts, and that for two cau&s;es: the one, for that the formes of making all manner of Dials is but of three &s;orts, as &s;halbe &s;hewed in the next three Chapt. therefore marke them well, make tho&s;e and make all the other: for that the dials to euery of tho&s;e Hori|zons require their cocke or <HI>Gnomon</HI> of a &s;euerall forme. For the dyals of all flats lying in any right horizon, haue their hourelines parallel one to another, and their cocke a long &s;quare, although &s;ome v&s;e a &s;tile or wyer, which is not &s;o good nor &s;o agreeable to the nature of the diall: becau&s;e the &s;tile mu&s;t be of a iu&s;t de|terminate length: and then can yelde &s;hade to the Dyall but from the very toppe: whereas the long &s;quare cocke yeldeth a long line for &s;hade, and the &s;ame alway parallel to the hourelines, and like vnto them. The Dyals of all flats lying in thequin. are but a circle deuided into 24. equall parts, the hourelines meeting at the centre, who&s;e cocke or <HI>Gnomon.</HI> mo&s;t commonly is a &s;tile or pin erected: neither is it materiall how long or &s;hort hee bee. The Dyals to all flattes lying in any oblique or byas horizon, are a circle deuided into 24. vnequall parts, the hourelines concurring at the centre, who&s;e cocke or <HI>Gnomon</HI> mu&s;t needes be a triangle, his &s;ide yelding the &s;hade to the Dyall, eleuated in height according to the poles eleuation: though &s;ome barbo|rou&s;ly, as I may terme it, v&s;e a wyer bent a &s;lope to the poles height, which euery bird almo&s;t with &s;itting on it, may way from his pitch, and then all is marde till &s;ome &s;kilfull man come to mende it, becau&s;e euery man knoweth not what the height of the pole meaneth. For I remember well I asked a cunning gardiner once, that had &s;et vp a po&s;t a&s;lope in a curious Garden in the midde&s;t of a circle, what he would make: a Dyall (&s;aid he) why? &s;aid I, how heigh is the pole here, &s;aide he &s;ixe foote heigh, pointing to the po&s;t that him&s;elfe had &s;et vp: whereat I laughed hartely &s;eeing &s;o cunning a peice of worke towards: but now againe to my matter. As there are but three diuer&s;ities of Dyals and horizons, &s;o are they ea&s;ily to be made in euery country, wher|vnto they &s;erue without any difficultie, if a man were in euery &s;uch place &s;euerally, by occa&s;ion of trauaile or otherwi&s;e. But yet to make the Dyals, which of right ought to &s;erue in other countries, to &s;hew the houres and &s;erue your turne in your owne countrie, maketh a great &s;hew of skill, and of diuer&s;e &s;orts of Dyals, to tho&s;e that vnder&s;tand not the cau&s;es of them. For the murall declining, reclining, inclyning orientall and occiden|tall Dyals and all others, the plaine horizontall excepted, are dyals which of right belong to other countries, and horizons, and are but wre&s;ted as it were to &s;erue altogether to one place: neither is there any of them but is one of the three &s;ortes before mentioned. There is none of them but of right &s;erueth to a countrie, dif|fering from yours, either in longitude, or latitude, or both: but e&s;pecially the difference of longitude maketh this great diuer&s;itie and difficultie, for that onely driueth vs to alter the true cour&s;e of the hourelines, and their numbers to make them &s;erue in our countrie. As for example, in an Ea&s;t Dyall, in the place where the cocke &s;tandeth he &s;heweth no &s;hade, and then is it 6. of the clocke in our countrie, but to that countrie who&s;e difference of longitude is 90. deg, Ea&s;twards, or more plainely who&s;e pole zenith is in thea&s;t point of our horizon, it is then 12. of the clocke, and &s;o would it giue al&s;o in our countrie, if you laide the &s;ame Dyall &s;o that his pole zenith may be in our meridian, his flat cutting the poles.</P>
<P>Likewi&s;e in the declining Dyals here in our countrie, the perpendiculer is alwayes 12. of the clocke: but in the horizon or countrie whereto the Dyall &s;hould &s;erue, the 12. of clocke is iu&s;t where the cocke &s;tandeth, &s;o that it is a general rule if you &s;ee any Dyal, his cocke yeelding no &s;hade at 12. of clocke: that the &s;ame is made to the longitude of the &s;ame place: wherefore to conclude my purpo&s;e, there are but three diuer&s;ities of Dy|als, onely the &s;ituation and change of the place maketh the alteration.</P>

<P>VVHen you come into any countrey, where you would make a dial: fir&s;t you mu&s;t get the poles eleua|tion or latitude, thereby the 3. book 5. &amp; 8. chap. &amp; if you fynd the pole eleuated any whit, then you may be &s;ure it is an oblique horizon: to which if you wil make a dial, &s;et the <HI>finitor</HI> of your <HI>iewel</HI> vnto the &s;ame latit. found where you &s;hal &s;ee the <HI>Limbe</HI> or vttermo&s;t meridian of your <HI>iewel</HI> and the axetree or Ea&s;t houre line, to cut the <HI>finitor</HI> 90. deg. or one quadrant apart: which is the cau&s;e that in an horizon diall, the fir&s;t point is to deuide the circle into 4. quarters. Furthermore, if you behold your <HI>iewel</HI> wel in that &s;cituation, you &s;hall &s;ee, that the houre circles, (I meane euery 15. meridian) on the one &s;ide of the axetree line, doe cut like e|quall degrees on the <HI>finitor,</HI> vnto the houre circles on the other &s;ide, eche to his matche, beeing both recko|ned eyther from the &s;eueral vttermo&s;t partes of the <HI>Limbe</HI> or on ech &s;ide from the centre: which is the cau&s;e, that if the deg. of an oblique diall be knowne for one quarter, all the other 3. quarters are to bee drawne by that: &s;o that by this meanes, the two diameters &s;eruing for the noone line and Ea&s;tline being drawne, 5. &s;pa|ces more knowne &s;hall &s;erue to make the whole dial by: which in my opinion can be no great toile.</P>
<P>Example: here at Reading the latitude is 51 2/3. deg. and therefore is an oblique horizon.

Then for my further ea&s;e, becau&s;e I wold not deuide the <HI>Limbe</HI> of my dial into 360. deg. as <HI>Cor.

</FIGURE> The line GH repre&s;enteth a South wall declining VVe&s;t, and a North wall declining Ea&s;t, lying in the 135. &amp; 315. azimuth, and &s;o of all the re&s;t, which you &s;ee in this figure drawn within the le&s;&s;er circle, repre&s;enting the globe of the earth, &amp; are to be ex|tended, or as many other as you can imagine. It is mo&s;te certaine and manife&s;t by the 2. def. that the poles zenith and Nadir of euery azimuth lie in the horizo~, as the poles of euery meridian lie in the Equinoct. VVherfore as the pole zenith of a &s;outh wall, mu&s;t needes lie by the &s;ayde definitio~ in the &s;outh point of the horizo~: eue~ &s;o the pole zenith of any declining wall re&s;pecting the South, de|parteth &s;o much fro~ the South point, as the declinatio~ co~|meth to: &amp; &s;o likewi&s;e of any wal, re&s;pecting the north: his pole Zenith departeth from the North point, according to the declination, in&s;omuch if you will aske mee what the declination of a wall is: I &s;ay it is the di&s;tance between his pole zenith, &amp; the &s;outh or north points by deg. of the horizon: &amp; looke which way the pole zenith departeth, thence is the declination denominated or called, as if the pole Zenith of a wall lie betweene the South &amp; Ea&s;t point, then is that wall called a South wal declining Ea&s;t: &amp; &s;o of the re&s;t. As for example, in this figure the pole zenith of the South wall CD is B, but the pole zenith of the North wall CD, is A. Likewi&s;e of the Ea&s;t wall AB is D, &amp; of the VVe&s;t wal AB, is C, for euery circle hath 2. faces, as is &s;aid in the 10. preamble. Al&s;o of the South wal declining VVe&s;t EF, the pole zenith is H, who&s;e declination is the &s;pace HB, but of the Northwall declining Ea&s;t, repre&s;ented by EF, the pole Zenith is G, who&s;e declination is AG, and &s;o of the re&s;t. By all this you may well gather, that euery wall, flat, and horizon, ought to take his name of the place or point where his pole zenith lieth, and not of his owne &s;cituation: for if I &s;hould &s;ay, make me a diall to the wal CD, who could tell, whether I meant a North or South diall, but if I &s;ay make me a diall to the South wall CD, it is ea&s;ie to vnder&s;tand: wherfore me thinketh as I &s;hewed in the 5. chap. they abu&s;e their tearmes who call that an Equinoctial dial, who&s;e pole Zenith is the pole it &s;elfe, mentioned in the 7. chap. which in my opinion ought to bee called a pole or polare diall. La&s;tly, al declining walles are deuided into 2. &s;orts, &amp; eche of tho&s;e againe &s;ubdiuided into other two: the diui&s;ion is into North declining, and South declining: of which the fir&s;t haue their pole zenithes in the North &s;emicircle CAD, the 2. in the South &s;emicircle CBD, the &s;ubdiui&s;ion of the North declining is in|to North, declining Ea&s;t: who&s;e pole Zenithes lie in the northea&s;t quadra~t AGD, &amp; North declining VVe&s;t, who&s;e pole zenithes lie in the northwe&s;t quadrant AEC. The &s;ubdiui&s;io~ of the South declining, is into &s;outh, declining Ea&s;t, who&s;e pole zeniths are in the Southea&s;t quadrant BFD, &amp; into Southwe&s;t, who&s;e poles are in the quadrant CHB.</P>

<FIGURE>
<FIGDESC>depiction of a male figure using the mathematical jewel beside a house</FIGDESC>
</FIGURE> By a wall re&s;pecting the South, I mean a South declining wall, &amp; it is ea&s;ily to be known, becau&s;e the Sun being in the South, yet &s;hineth on him though he decline neuer &s;o farre Ea&s;t or VVe&s;t, by which you may alwaies knowe a South declining wall: wherfore when you come to any &s;uch wal: Fir&s;t de|ui&s;e to place your <HI>Iewel</HI> vpon &s;ome &s;toole or otherwi&s;e <HI>Leuel</HI> with the horizon: but &s;o that the line of <HI>Leuel</HI> may directly &s;tand perpendicu|ler or &s;quare from the wall: neither is it material whether he &s;tande clo&s;e to the wal or not: which to do one way is thus: If the wal haue any returning &s;quare neere the place, then choo&s;e your &s;tanding, &s;o that laying the rule on the &s;aid <HI>leuel</HI> line, you may through the &s;ights looke directly with the end of the wal, as if you would make a dy|al on the &s;ide of a hou&s;e, commonly the ende of the hou&s;e &s;hutteth &s;quare vpon it, &s;o that if you lay the <HI>Leuel</HI> line directly with the end, then he &s;tandeth &s;quare to the &s;ide. Another way is thus: get a large &s;quire, &s;et one &s;ide euen to the wal, and parallel to the horizon, and ha~g at the other &s;ide. 2. plum lines, at ech end one, there let one hold it til you haue cho&s;e~ you a &s;ta~ding: &s;o that the rule lying on the <HI>Leuel,</HI> you may &s;ee through the &s;ightes, the one plum line hiding the other, &amp; there fixe your <HI>Iewel</HI> on the &s;toole.</P>
<PB N="102" REF="60">
<P>The third and be&s;t way as I think is, eyther to fa&s;ten your <HI>Iewel</HI> with waxe or pitch on the &s;ide of a &s;quire &s;o that his line of <HI>Leuel</HI> lye eue~ with it, or els to get a little &s;quare boord or block: or for a &s;hift, a &s;quare tre~cher may &s;erue, and thereon draw a line through the midde&s;t, perpendiculer from one of the &s;ides: in which place the <HI>Leuel</HI> line of your <HI>Iewel,</HI> and apply it to the wall. VVell, to come to the matter, when you haue thus placed your <HI>Iewel,</HI> then doth the <HI>Leuel</HI> line poynt directly to the pole Zenith of the wall: therefore turning about the rule till the &s;un pearce both the &s;ightes, or at the lea&s;t erecting a wyre in the one &s;ight, the &s;hade thereof beyng proiected on the other: you haue in the <HI>Limb</HI> of your <HI>Iewel,</HI> the horizo~tal di&s;ta~ce between the Sun, &amp; the wals pole zenith (that is to &s;ay) betweene the azimuth, wherein the Sunne is then, and the azimuth cutting the walles pole zenith: wherefore you mu&s;t pre&s;ently take vp your <HI>Iewel,</HI> and take the altitude of the Sun, by whi|che &amp; the 3. booke 6. chap. you &s;hall know in what azimuth reckoned from the South, the Sun is then, either Ea&s;twards or VVe&s;twardes. Nowe by the Sunnes azimuth known, and his di&s;taunce from the pole zenith of the wall, you &s;hal alwayes know the declination of the wall by the&s;e rules following: therefore marke the~ well, together with the&s;e 4. figures, in which the circuite CLDK repre&s;enteth the horizon DC, the meri|dian C being the South part thereof, N the zenith, NA the azimuth wherein the Sun is: EF the ba&s;e of the declining wall, B his pole zenith, B Hithe line in which the line of <HI>Leuel,</HI> mu&s;t lie, K Ea&s;t, L VVe&s;t. Fir&s;t, if the Sunne be directly with the <HI>Leuell</HI> line of the <HI>Iewell,</HI> that is to &s;aye, hauing no di|&s;taunce from the pole zenith of the wall, as in this figure, then is the Sunnes azimuth reckoned from the South, equall to the walles declination, that way as the Sun lyeth, Ea&s;t or VVe&s;t: but as this &s;eldom happeneth, or not at all, if you choo&s;e the be&s;t times: &s;o in all other ca&s;es you haue three thinges to bee noted, that is, whether the wall decline Ea&s;t, which you may bee &s;ure of in the morning: for in al wals declining Ea&s;t, the Sun com|meth to them before 6. &amp; departeth at night before 6.

La&s;tly, whether the Sunnes azimuth found, bee Ea&s;t or VVe&s;t from the meridian: al which you mu&s;t be &s;ure to note downe, which done, then in all Ea&s;t declining walles, if the di|&s;taunce of the Sunnes azimuth from the <HI>Leuel</HI> line, chance to be Ea&s;t from the <HI>Leuel</HI> line, as A is from B, and the Sunne al&s;o Ea&s;t from the meridian as A is from C, in this 2. fygure, then take the deg. of the di&s;taunce, videl.

B, C is your de&s;ire, if the di|&s;taunce be VVe&s;t, as A is from B, and the Sun VVe&s;t, as A from C, in this 3. fygure, then take the azimuth, videl. AC, out of the di&s;tance videl.

All which you may perceiue by the la&s;t 3. figures, &s;o that the words Ea&s;t and VVe&s;t change places. The&s;e rules &s;hew harde, but you &s;hall little neede them when you are working: for the very &s;cituation of the di&s;taunce and the Sunne, will almo&s;t alone direct you. Onely I &s;et down the&s;e, lea&s;t you &s;houlde doubt in any thing. Be&s;ides that, you may ea&s;e the matter thus: if the wall decline Ea&s;t, come be|times in the morning, and the Sunne and di&s;tance &s;hall be both Ea&s;t: if VVe&s;t, towards the euening, &amp; they &s;hall both be VVe&s;t: &s;o that in both the&s;e you need but take the di&s;taunce out of the azimuth, according to the &s;econde figure: whiche tymes are more conuenient then about the midde&s;t of the daye to gette the Sunnes exact azimuth by his altitude, as by proofe you &s;hall finde.</P>
<P>For example, the 26. of Iulie 1581, the &Sun; then beeing 12 &frac12;. in &Leo;, I being reque&s;ted to make a diall on the Church wall of Sooning be&s;ides Reading, to &s;et the clocke by, did place the <HI>Leuell</HI> line of my <HI>Iewell</HI> &s;quare from the wall by helpe of a &s;quare boorde: then turning about the rule to the Sunne, it cut in the <HI>Limbe</HI> 36 &frac12;. deg. Ea&s;twards of the <HI>Leuell</HI> line, which I noted in a paper, and quickly tooke vp my <HI>Iewell</HI> and tooke the altitude of the Sun 45. deg. the &s;ame in&s;tant, by which &amp; the 3. booke 6. chap. I found the Sun to bee in the 53. azimuth reckoned from the South Ea&s;twards: wherfore according to the 2. figure, taking the di&s;tance 36. &frac12;. out of the azimuth 53. there remained 16 &frac12;. the true declination of the wall. For taking the declinations of North walles the
<PB N="103" REF="60"> difference is nothing but that you mu&s;t reckon the Sunnes azimuth from the North, as here is done from the South.</P>
<P>Another example, the 14. of Augu&s;t 1581. the &Sun; being in &Virgo; 1 &frac23;. de. I took the declinatio~ of another wal about the &s;ame church, declining VVe&s;t, to &s;erue the after noone: wherefore comming thither towards the e|uening, I found the di&s;tance VVe&s;t 20. deg. and the azimuth VVe&s;t 73 &frac13;. degrees, then taking as before the di&s;taunce, vz. 20. out of the azimuth 73 &frac13;. there re&s;ted 53 &frac13;. deg. the wals true declination VVe&s;twards. Note that if the ruler of your <HI>Iewell</HI> want nece&s;&s;ary &s;ights for this purpo&s;e, you may hold a threed, and plummet in your hand, &s;o that the &s;hade of the threed cut the centre of the <HI>Iewell,</HI> and then placing the edge of the rule e|uen with the &s;ame &s;hade, you haue your de&s;ire.</P>

<HEAD><HI>Chapter 16.</HI> How by the declination of any wall knowne, to finde his eleuation with his angle of deflexion.</HEAD>
<P>THe eleuation of a wal is alwaies the height of the cock, for as I haue often &s;aid, the cock of any oblique diall, mu&s;t be eleuated in his due place, as much as the pole is eleuated aboue the wal wheron it &s;ta~deth. The angle of deflexion, I cal the angle made between the 12. a clock or plu~b line of the wal, &amp; the line where the cock mu&s;t &s;tand: which line is al&s;o the meridian of the horiz. repre&s;ented by the wal. VVherefore reckon on the <HI>limbe</HI> of your <HI>Iewel</HI> the walles declination learned by the la&s;t chap. and that from the pole right|wards, if the wal declining Ea&s;t, or leftwards, if VVe&s;t (though it be not material which way but only for the demon&s;trations &s;ake following,) and thereto lay the Zenith of your <HI>Reete,</HI> then reckon on the axetree line fro~ the centre the eleuation of the South wall or the co~plement of the latitude, al is one, &amp; mark what azimuth of your <HI>Reete,</HI> doth cut the axtree line in that deg. for if on the &s;ame azimuth you reckon thence to the <HI>Finitor,</HI> you haue the poles eleuation to that wall, and the degrees of the <HI>Finitor</HI> between the &s;ame azimuth &amp; the cen|tre is the 4. angle of deflexion.</P>
<P>Example, the declination of the fir&s;t wall mentioned in the la&s;t chap. was there found 16 &frac12;. degrees Ea&s;t|wards, which 16 &frac12;. deg. I reckon on the <HI>limb</HI> of my <HI>Iewel</HI> fro~ the pole rightwards, thereto I lay the zenith of my <HI>Reete,</HI> which done, I number on the axetree line from the centre, the South walles eleuation, vz. 38 &frac13;. degrees &amp; there do I &s;ee to cut the 12 &frac12;. azim. reckoned fro~ the zen. line, on which 12 &frac12;. azi. cou~nting fro~ the &s;aid 38 &frac13;. de. to the <HI>fin.</HI> I find 36 &frac13;. deg. which is the eleuation of the South pole to that declining wall, then on the <HI>finiter</HI> betweene the &s;ayd azimuth, and the centre I find 12 &frac12;. deg. which is the angle of deflexion of the &s;ame wall: &amp; &s;o much mu&s;t the cock &s;tand from the plumbe line, which in all perpendiculer walles repre&s;enteth our me|ridian. This truely is a &s;inguler conclu&s;ion which you will confe&s;&s;e, if you conceiue the rea&s;on of it, which is thus. The <HI>limb</HI> of the <HI>Iewel</HI> repre&s;enteth our horizon the axtree line our meridia~ or Ea&s;t wall: the Equinoctial the Ea&s;t azimuth or South wall: the end of the Equinoctial line rightwardes, the Ea&s;t point of our horizon, the other end the VVe&s;t: the centre the Zenith or rather his Nadir: the <HI>Finitor</HI> the declining wall, and the Zenith of the <HI>Reete,</HI> the pole Zenith of the &s;ame wall. All this &s;o determined, and the di&s;taunce of the South pole from our Nadir, vz. 38 &frac13;. deg. reckoned on the axtree line fro~ the centre, there mu&s;t needs bee the &s;outh pole. Therefore the 12 &frac12;. azimuth cutting the &s;ame 38 &frac13;. deg. mu&s;t needes repre&s;ent the meridian of the wall by the definition of a meridian which is to cut the poles and pa&s;&s;e by the Zenith of his horizon, and becau&s;e the height of the pole is alwaies the arch of the meridian betweene the pole eleuated and the horizon: there|fore the &s;aide 36 &frac13;. deg. mu&s;t needs be it. But what may you &s;ee more, O notable &s;ingularity of an in&s;trument that is, ina&s;much as you &s;ee that the angle made betweene the &s;aid 12 &frac12; azimuth, and the axetree at their cro&s;|&s;ing in the &s;aid 38 &frac13;. deg. to be VVe&s;twards on the <HI>Finitor:</HI> therfore you might be &s;ure if I had not tolde you, that the angle of deflexion mu&s;t be made on your dial VVe&s;twards from the plumbe line, for it is a generall rule, if the diall decline Ea&s;t, then mu&s;t the cocke &s;tand on the VVe&s;t &s;ide of the plumbe line, if VVe&s;t then on the Ea&s;t &s;ide.</P>

<P>THough I tooke &s;ome more paines then needes in the la&s;te chap. to &s;hewe you &s;ome plea&s;ure, I meane to take the more ea&s;e in this: for in truth the la&s;t chap. is onely performed by the 7. chap. of &s;pherical trian|gles, ina&s;much as the que&s;tion demanded fel out to be the 2. &s;ides vnknown of a right angled triangle, who&s;e one &s;ide 38 &frac13; was knowne, and one of the angles not right, which was the complement of the decli|tion, that is to &s;ay, the angle betweene the axetree and the <HI>Finitor:</HI> and therefore the la&s;t chap. and the &s;ayd 7. chap. of trian. wel vnder&s;tood, it is as ea&s;ie to doe it by the 6. chap thus: the declination of the wal giuen, videl. 16 &frac12;. deg. take that from 90. &s;o haue you the complement thereof, vz. 73 &frac12;. whiche number from the <HI>Limbe</HI> a|mong the meridians in the &s;ame 73 &frac12;. meridia~ fou~d, reckon <HI>y^e</HI> &s;ide giue~ being the &s;outh poles eleuatio~, vz. 38 &frac13;. deg. and thereto lay the rule, &amp; &s;o are the degr. of the rule betweene the &s;aide 73 &frac13;. &amp; the <HI>Limbe</HI> the poles e|leuation, which you &s;hall find, as in the la&s;t chap. 36 &frac13;. deg. the deg. of the <HI>limbe</HI> between the rule and the pole, vz. 12 &frac12;. as before are the deg. of the angle of deflexion: now iudge whether my worke of &s;pher. trian. be not profitable, the &s;tudy of which brought me to al this, and wil bring any man to much more that will con&s;ider wel of it.</P>

<HEAD><HI>Chapter 18.</HI> To performe the &s;ame a third way.</HEAD>
<P>GOod God &s;o infinite is the v&s;e of this <HI>Iewell,</HI> that I &s;hould not know how to fini&s;h, but that want of time will driue me to ha&s;ten one end or other: here haue you now a third way to fynd your angles of eleua|tion, and deflexion, more apparant without wre&s;ting of the &s;pheare then either of the other: I &s;hewed before in the 15. chap. that the <HI>Finitor</HI> beyng &s;ette to the latitude, the Zenith line repre&s;enteth the South wall, and the azimuthes the declining walles, who&s;e pole Zenithes are all &s;cituate in the <HI>Finitor:</HI> wherefore now to come to the matter, &s;et the <HI>Finitor</HI> to the latitude, and reckon among the azimuthes from the Zenith line to|wards the pole, the walles declination, and the azimuth there repre&s;enteth the declining wall: then to finde his eleuation, you mu&s;t &s;eeke his meridian or &s;ome portion thereof, which is alwayes a great circle pa&s;sing by the pole zenith of this wall, and one or both of the poles of the worlde. As for the poles you &s;ee where they are, and where the pole Zenith of this wall is, cannot be farre to &s;eeke: for looke howe much the wall or azi|muthe is declined from the Zenith line Southwardes: &s;o muche his pole zenith is departed from the South point of the <HI>Finitor,</HI> towardes the centre. VVherefore if you reckon thence inwards the degrees of the walles declination, there is, no doubt, his pole zenith: which being founde, looke what meridian circle you &s;ee to goe from thence &s;treight to the pole, mu&s;t needes be the meridian of the wall by definition of a meridian, and therefore marke where he cutteth the azimuth of the wal, for his degrees thence reckoned to the pole, is the eleuation no doubt, and the portion of the azimuth betweene this hys meridian, and the Zenith poynte of the <HI>Reete,</HI> is the angle of deflection. This chapter doth depende on the rea&s;on of the 24. chapter of &s;pherical try|angles.</P>
<P>For example, in the wal declining VVe&s;t 53 &frac13;. deg. mentioned in the 15. chap. the <HI>Finitor</HI> &s;et to the latitude, reckon the 53 &frac13;. azimuth from the Zenith line &s;outhwards, which azim. repre&s;enteth the &s;aid wal: the~ to fynd the walles pole Zenith, reckon on the <HI>Finitor</HI> 53 &frac13;. deg. inwards from the South, &amp; there &s;hal you fynd the 60. meridian almo&s;t counted from the <HI>Limbe,</HI> thence taking his way to the pole, which mu&s;t needs be the meridi|an of the horizon repre&s;ented by this wall: therefore marke where he cutteth the 53 &frac13;. azimuth, the di&s;taunce on him thence to the pole, you &s;hal fynd 21 &frac34;. deg. the walles eleuation, and the &s;pace betweene the &s;aid cro&s;|&s;ing and the zenith, counted on the 53 &frac13;. azimuth, you &s;hal fynd 32. deg. &frac13; the angle of deflexio~. But &s;ee more the forwardne&s;&s;e of your <HI>Iewell,</HI> which &s;heweth vnasked the difference of longitude of this country from the countrey where to the wall is horizon: vz. 60. deg. almo&s;t the di&s;taunce betweene the meridians, cutting the pole Zeniths of eyther place.</P>

<HEAD><HI>Chapter 19.</HI> How to make a diall to any declining wall, re&s;pecting the South.</HEAD>
<P>THe making of declining dialles before now that this my <HI>Iewel</HI> wil ea&s;e it, hath byn very trouble&s;ome &amp; paineful with a number of lineaments to be put out after the dial ended, of which the Theorical demo~|&s;tration was not &s;hewed, as in <HI>Mun&s;ter</HI> &amp; <HI>Orontius de horologiis,</HI> you may &s;ee, whereby you had verye fewe but went blindly to woorke on them. I haue &s;eene in&s;tructions in many bookes, how to make the horizon &amp; South wall dialles, as namely in <HI>Albertus Durerus, Daniel Sambecke, Gemma Fri&s;ius, Curtei&s;e,</HI> and diuers other: but whe~ t hath come to the declining dials, they haue giuen it ouer in the plaine field.</P>
<P>But to the matter, you may note thus much of your &s;elfe, that euery declining wal is an oblique horiz. be|cau&s;e you are driuen to &s;eek his eleuation, wherby you wold think that the dial &s;hould differ nothing in ma|king from the oblique diall in the 9. cha. as in effect it doth not, after you haue placed the &s;aid angles, &amp; fou~d where you mu&s;t begin to reckon your houres. VVherfore in Gods name, fir&s;t make a plumb line on the wal, wherein appoint the centre of your diall: theron making a blind circle equal to your <HI>Iewels Limbe,</HI> as in the ob|lique diall you made a quadrant: in this blynd circle &s;et the deg. of deflexion, (take~ from your <HI>Iewels Limbe</HI>) as you are wont, and that below the centre VVe&s;twards of the plumbe line, if the wall decline Ea&s;t: or Ea&s;t|wardes, if VVe&s;t: thereto from the centre draw a long line where the cock &s;hal &s;tand, &amp; cro&s;&s;e the &s;ame lyne on the centre with another, &s;ufficie~t for the diameter of your dial: vpo~ which diameter, make the circle or <HI>limb</HI> of your dial, in which write 12. at the plumb line, for that is alwaies the 12. a clock line: but now to proceede further, for the deg. of the other houre lines, &s;et the <HI>Finitor</HI> &s;o many deg. vnder one of the poles (the matter is not great which) as the wals eleuation co~meth to: and &s;o doth the <HI>Finitor</HI> repre&s;ent the wall, &amp; the <HI>Limbe</HI> the meridia~, to the wal or to that countrey who&s;e horiz. it is. So that if you were in that countrey, you might pro|ceed to make this dial as in the 9. chap. But now to place the houre lines in him to &s;erue our cou~trey, you mu&s;t &s;eek out on your <HI>Iewel</HI> or meridian: for the <HI>limbe</HI> is here the walles meridian, and from our meridian of ne|ce&s;sity we mu&s;t haue al the houres reckoned: which to find nu~ber on the <HI>finitor</HI> placed to <HI>y^e</HI> eleuatio~ as before, the angle of deflexion from the <HI>limbe</HI> inwards, marke what meridian cutteth the <HI>finitor,</HI> there the &s;ame is the meridian of our cou~trey, which when you haue, marke him wel that you may know him: for it is he that lea|deth this daunce, &amp; is already repre&s;ented on the wall by the plumb line. VVherefore if beginning from this meridian, you di&s;tingui&s;h on your <HI>Iewel</HI> euery 15. going thence in order from 15. meridian to 15. quite rou~d, returning at the <HI>limbe</HI> til your compa&s;&s;e be vp: the&s;e meridians or rather houre circles thus di&s;tingui&s;hed, &s;hall cut the deg. on the <HI>finitor</HI> &s;o &s;tanding to the walles eleuation an&s;wearable to euerye houre in all re&s;pectes, as in the oblique dial in the 9. chap. which deg. by help of the blind circle made before, you may place in your di|al, remembring that you mu&s;t here begin from our new found meridian, &amp; not fro~ the <HI>Limbe</HI> as there: &amp; the &s;paces, deg. or houres from this meridia~ towards the <HI>limbe</HI> of your new <HI>iewel,</HI> mu&s;t be &s;et in your diall towards the line where there the cock &s;hal &s;tand and &s;o round: the rea&s;on is for that the <HI>limbe</HI> is now the meridia~ of the wal, &amp; on the dial is the line of the cock, wherby you may &s;ee that the cock will not &s;tand out of the meridi|an of his horizon.</P>

<HEAD><HI>Chap. 24.</HI> How to make a Dyall to a &s;outh or north reclining or inclining wall, bancke or flatte.</HEAD>
<P>A South or North reclining or inclining flatte is &s;uch a one by the 21.

Chapt. placing the cocke and 12. a clocke in the ba&s;es perpendiculer &s;outhwards, if on your <HI>Iewel</HI> you finde the &s;outh pole e|leuated: or northwards, if the north pole.</P>
<P>As for example, admit that in our latitude being 51 &frac23; deg. by the 23. Chapt. I founde a &s;outh flatte recli|ning 20. deg. Fir&s;t I &s;et the <HI>Finitor</HI> to our latitude by the 2. booke 19&mdash;Chapt. there I finde the zenith point of the <HI>Reete</HI> to &s;hew 38 &frac13; deg. counted from the north pole. Thence I remoue him according to the reclination found vz. 20. deg. more from the &s;outhwards, where I finde the North pole di&s;tant, or rather depre&s;&s;ed 18 &frac13; de. vnder this flat, being the zenith line: but looking towards the other end therof, there I finde the &s;outh pole 18 &frac13; degrees eleuated aboue this flat by the 10. preamble. For this is generall that the zenith line, I meane drawne forth vnto his Nadir, &s;upplieth al flats, who&s;e poles zenith &amp; poles Nadir lye in your meridian circle. VVherefore now by the 9. or 10. Chapt. making an oblique Dyall to 18 &frac13; eleuation, his cocke and 12. of clocke &s;tanding in the ba&s;es perpendiculer turned towards the &s;outh, you haue done. And the &s;ame Dyall the 12. and cocke turned north, &s;erueth the north flat in our latitude inclining 20. deg. But if a South wall be re|clining, or a North wall inclining according to the Equinoctials height aboue our horizon vz. 38 &frac13; degrees. then will the zenith line one your <HI>Iewel</HI> lie in the two poles, &s;o that neither is eleuated. Wherefore by the 8. Chapt. you may know the &s;ame flat to be a right horizon, in which Chap. the Dyall is alredie made thereto. If a South wall recline or a North wall incline more then the Equinoctials height in your latitude: as admit with vs 60. deg. your <HI>Iewel</HI> fir&s;t placed to the latitude, remoue the zenith line towards the north pole and be|yond, till he come to 60. deg. from his right place, and you &s;hall there finde the north pole di&s;tant, and eleua|ted aboue the &s;aid &s;outh reclining flat 21 &frac23; deg. and the &s;outh pole eleuated or rather depre&s;&s;ed vnder the &s;aid North reclining flat as much vz. 21 &frac23; deg. for the zenith line repre&s;enteth them both: to which eleuation you may make their Dyals by the 9. &amp; 10.

<HEAD><HI>Chapter 25.</HI> How to make a Dyall to an Ea&s;t and We&s;t wall, bancke or flat reclining or inclining.</HEAD>
<P>THe ba&s;e line of euery Ea&s;t and We&s;t reclining and inclining flat lieth directly in the meridian line, as in the 21. Chapt. and in truth euery of them&s;elues lyeth in the flat of one or other of the circles of po&s;iti|on: (that is to &s;ay) they all cro&s;&s;e vpon the inter&s;ection of the meridian with the Horizon, as the decli|ning wals do in the zenith and Nadir, their poles zenith and Nadir lying all in the circle of the Ea&s;t, called of &s;ome the verticall circle. What a circle of po&s;ition is, looke the 3. Booke 43. Chapt. The Dyall to euerie of the&s;e is made in all re&s;pects as the declining wall dyall. And to make the matter more plaine to the learner, whom I would as willingly helpe as I on&s;e could haue beene contented to be holpen, know that all reclining and inclining Dyals of this &s;ort are the very declining wal Dyals to that country which hath a &s;outh latitude equall to the complement of your latitude being heere at Reading 38 &frac13; degrees. Wherefore if you did but imagine your &s;elfe in a South latitude, of 38 &frac13; deg. &amp; turne your <HI>Iewel</HI> vp&s;idedown accordingly as you do here in your owne, you may ea&s;ily perceiue the zenith line to be there your verticall circle, and all the Azimuthes your declining wals, which are heere circles of po&s;ition, and may make your Dyals to them by the 19. Chapter. Nowe notwith&s;tanding I thinke it plaine ynough to &s;ome alredie, yet I will not &s;ticke for o|ther &s;ome to pro&s;ecute this Chapter demon&s;tratiuely, the rather becau&s;e I haue &s;et but one example of de|clining VVall Dyalles. Admitte therefore heere in our latitude being 51 &frac23; at Reading: by the 23. Chapter, I founde an Ea&s;t VVall reclining from our zenith 50. degrees, I call that an Ea&s;t reclining
<PB N="109" REF="63"> wall or flat, who&s;e pole Zenith is in the Ea&s;t quadrant of the verticall circle. To make a diall to this flat, you &s;hall in &s;teede of the <HI>finitor,</HI> &s;et the Zenith line to the latitude, vz. 51 &frac23;. degree, vnder the North pole, &s;o &s;hall the azimuthes repre&s;ent all the Ea&s;t and VVe&s;t, reclining or inclining flats, and the <HI>finitor</HI> line now &s;upplieth the Zenith line for this turne. Then &s;ince my wall propo&s;ed, reclineth 50. degrees from the zenith, I reckon &s;o many degrees on the <HI>finitor</HI> from the <HI>Limbe</HI> inwardes, and there doe I finde the 50. Azimuth repre&s;enting my flat &s;ought for: aboue which al&s;o I may &s;ee the North pole eleuated: but howe much, &s;ince it appeareth not, you may thus finde. Marke which of the almicantares cutteth the pole, and where he cro&s;&s;eth this 50. azimuth: if thereto you &s;et the <HI>labell</HI> fixed: the degrees thereof betweene this cro&s;sing and the <HI>limbe,</HI> you &s;hall finde 36 &frac34;. which is the poles eleuation aboue that flat, and the degrees of the <HI>limbe</HI> betweene the <HI>label,</HI> and the pole, 39 &frac23;. the angle of deflection. Thus may you finde the eleuation and deflexion of any of the azimuths either in this con&s;titution or any other like, as declining walles, &amp;c. For it is but the rule of the 17. chapter, &s;omewhat more plainely &s;et downe for this purpo&s;e. The&s;e had, you &s;hall draw through the midde&s;t of your reclining flat, his ba&s;e line parallel to the horizon, vz. AB, which, as is &s;aid, in all the&s;e dialles, lyeth directly North and South, euen in the meridian line. In this ba&s;e line AB, pitch the center of your diall, vz. D, and thereon de&s;cribe a <HI>Limbe</HI> for your diall to write the numbers in, and within it a blind circle equall to your <HI>Ie|wels limbe,</HI> wherein &s;et the note C, 39 &frac23;. de.

<HEAD><HI>Chapter 26.</HI> How to finde the angles of the poles eleuation, dials deflection, and meridians a&s;cen&s;ion, to any reclining or inclining wall declining.</HEAD>
<P>BY the title of this chap. you may &s;ee that there belongeth to the making of a reclining diall many angles which mu&s;t fir&s;t &s;phearically be gotten before the diall can bee made: namely his reclinatio~ fro~ the Ze|nith, his declination from the North or South in his ba&s;e line, his deflection from your meridian, and nowe la&s;tly another angle lept in, which is the a&s;cen&s;ion of your meridian aboue the ba&s;e line, which in the la&s;t diall were both in one &s;elfe &s;ame line: therefore what did I &s;ay in the 19. chap. that the declining dialles were harde to make before time? It is not &s;o perhaps, if that be true, then were inclining and reclining dials more harde, nay mo&s;t hard, yea and &s;o intricate, that I haue not &s;eene any to haue perfourmed them, but on|ly Andreas Sconerus, yet hee without any theoricall demon&s;tration. But it is &s;uch an intricate peece of work and the wor&s;e by mi&s;printing that he him&s;elfe had neede come againe to vnder&s;tand it. There mu&s;t be &s;uch a &s;ort of circles, lineaments, &s;uch a number of quadrants and deui&s;es drawen and diuided vpon the wall or paper in &s;uche abundance ere the diall can beee made that a man woulde thinke it a wilderne&s;&s;e of lines ra|ther then any reguler peece of worke. Tell me then, if the diamond be &s;et by, in that he is rare and &s;hineth in the darke&s;t places, and cutteth deepe where nothing els wyll &s;cratche, who dare cauill that I call my in|&s;trument a <HI>Iewell,</HI> that &s;heweth the mo&s;t hidden &amp; difficult matters of the &s;peare as broad as day, and perfor|meth the harde&s;t with plaine&s;&s;e &amp; ea&s;e. But now to come to this defu&s;e matter which hath balked a great many who haue been very bu&s;ie to &s;hew their skill in other &s;lighter dials.</P>
<P>VVhen you haue the reclination of a wall, flat, or banke, together with the declination of his ba&s;e line, as in the 33. chap. is &s;hewed: Fir&s;t place the <HI>finitor</HI> in the axtree line of your <HI>Iewel,</HI> which here &s;hall be your meri|dian, thence remoue the <HI>finitor</HI> fro~ the South pole towards the left ha~d, if it be of a South flat reclining, &amp; his declination VVe&s;t or rightwards, if Ea&s;t according to the deg. of declination, and &s;o &s;hall your <HI>Iewell</HI> remayne in an excellent con&s;titution for this purpo&s;e As in example of the banck mentioned in the 23. chap. the de|clination of his ba&s;e line was 78 &frac12;. from the South VVe&s;twards, the reclination 56, deg. VVherefore the <HI>fini|tor,</HI> fir&s;t laid in the axtree, which heere I meane &s;hall repre&s;ent our meridian: remoue the South end thereof left wards 78 &frac12;. deg. which done, you &s;hall finde the Zenith point of the <HI>Reete,</HI> &s;tanding 11 &frac12;. degr. from the North pole. Now vnder&s;tand what your <HI>Iewell</HI> doth here repre&s;ent. Fir&s;t the <HI>limbe</HI> is our horizon, the axtree line is the Ea&s;t wall or meridian in whiche the North pole mu&s;t needes be found, the Equinoctiall is the South wall or Ea&s;t azimuth, the center is here the Zenith of our horizon, the right hand at this worde <HI>meri|dies</HI> is Ea&s;t, and the left hand at <HI>media nox</HI> VVe&s;t, in re&s;pect the <HI>Iewell</HI> is heere imagined to lie flatte, the Zenith line repre&s;enteth the &s;ide or ba&s;e line of the banck, the <HI>finitor</HI> the ba&s;es perpendiculer, wherein the reclination is taken. La&s;tly, if on the <HI>finitor</HI> from the center you reckon the reclination of the banck, vz. 56. deg. there haue you the azimuth repre&s;enting the bancke or rather the horizon, wherein the flat of the banck lyeth, whereto our dyal mu&s;t be made. Now &s;ir that you &s;ee the &s;tanding of all the circles of the &s;pheare needfull for thys purpo&s;e in theyr due con&s;titutio~, it is &s;ome cunning yet to get tho&s;e angles, which this chap. propo&s;eth, not|with&s;tanding one of them is there at hande: for if you reckon from the Zenith poynt of the <HI>reete,</HI> the deg. of the &s;aid 56. azimuth vnto his cro&s;sing with the axtree line, you &s;hal finde them 13 &frac23;. deg. which is the angle of our meridians a&s;cen&s;ion, that is to &s;ay, our meridian cro&s;&s;eth the ba&s;e line of this bancke making an an|gle about it of 13 &frac23;. deg. for the other angles, fir&s;t reckon in the axtree line, which now is our meridian as in the 16. chap. you did the poles eleuation, vz. 51 &frac23;. deg. from the <HI>limbe</HI> beeing nowe the horizon, there make a prick with inke for the pole: for now if you can deui&s;e with all your skil where <HI>y^e</HI> pole Zenith of the bank lyeth on your <HI>Iewel,</HI> and from him to lett downe an arch of a great circle, cutting the &s;aide pole or pricke of inke in the axtree line, hee mu&s;t needes repre&s;ent the meridian of the banckes horizon, by the 1. book and 4. chap. and &s;tande perdendiculer thereon, wherefore his portion or arch betweene the 56, azimuth, and the &s;ayd pole or pricke mu&s;t needes bee the poles eleuation &amp; the deg. of the 56. azimuth betweene it and the axtree &s;halbe the angle of deflexion. Now to make this matter plaine by demon&s;tration, rea&s;on thus. The Zenith line repre&s;enteth a wall declining VVe&s;t 78 &frac12;. deg, that is to &s;ay, a wal perpendiculer on the ba&s;e line of this bancke, therefore his poles Zenith &amp; Nadir mu&s;t needes bee in the endes of the <HI>finitor:</HI> but &s;ince this bancke reclineth from the Zenith beyng the center of the <HI>Iewel</HI> 56. deg. rightwardes: therefore his pole Ze|nith doth come in as much on the other &s;ide from the <HI>limbe</HI> towardes the center in the <HI>finitor</HI> line, as in the 4. booke and 4, chapter, and 5. booke and 24. chap. hath been &s;aide. This 56. deg. on the other &s;ide of the <HI>finitor</HI> founde, you &s;hall nowe for nece&s;sties &s;ake lay the <HI>label</HI> on the axtree line, and therein make the fore&s;aid prick for the pole, and there the <HI>label</HI> fixed to the <HI>reete,</HI> you &s;hall turne about the <HI>reete</HI> and <HI>label</HI> &s;o fixed tyll you find &s;ome of the meridians of the <HI>mater</HI> too cut both the &s;aide pole zenith founde in the <HI>finitor,</HI> and the &s;aide pole pricke in the <HI>label,</HI> which you &s;hall finde to bee done by the 65 &frac12;. meridian counted from the <HI>limbe</HI> there &s;tay your <HI>reer,</HI> and reckon on the &s;ame 65 &frac12;. meridian the degrees betweene the &s;aide pricke in the <HI>labell,</HI> and the &s;aide 56. azimuth which you &s;hall finde 35 &frac12;. deg. the &s;ame is the eleuation of the pole to this bancke. Then reckoning on the 56. azimuth from his cro&s;sing with this 65 &frac12;. meridian vnto the fiduciall line of the <HI>labell,</HI> which nowe repre&s;enteth our meridian, you &s;hall finde 28. deg. the angle of deflexion, and &s;o much mu&s;t the

You &s;hall as I taught you in my booke of triangles, drawe in a figure &s;uche circles of the &s;pheare, as you are to deale with in this que&s;tion, as here I haue done it to your hande, partly by ame, whiche for this turne &s;erueth as well as the true&s;t draught, where in the circle ABCD, repre&s;enteth our horizon AB. our meridian, CD, our Ea&s;t line, EF, the ba&s;e line of the banck propo&s;ed, GKH, the azimuth cro&s;sing hym &s;quare, in which the banckes pole zenith mu&s;t needes be by the 22. chapter ENF, is the great circle of the &s;pheare wherein the flat of the banke lyeth: A, the North poynt of our horizon B, the South, D Ea&s;t, C VVe&s;t, the center K, our zenith KN, the reclination of the banck, vz. 56. deg.

<P>Your plate being thus laide and well vnder&s;tood, then begin to de&s;cant on it thus. And fir&s;t too get the e|leuation of this bancke &s;ince the angle GKB, is knowen to be 78 &frac12;. deg. his complement BKF, &s;hal then be 11 &frac12;. deg. by the 5. booke, and fir&s;t chap. to which the angle EKA, is equall by the 5. theoreme: EG is a quadrant or 90. deg. to which adding EA, being 11 &frac12;. deg. it maketh 101 &frac12;. the angle AKC, then AL, beeing as is &s;aide 51 &frac23;. leaueth his complement LK, 38 &frac13;. deg. likewy&s;e GI. beyng 55. deg. leaueth hys complement KI, being the di&s;taunce of the banckes pole zenith, from our zenith 34. degrees. Heere then haue you a &s;phericall triangle, videlicet, IKL, who&s;e two &s;ides IK, 34. deg. and LK, 38 &frac13;. deg. togeather wyth the angle IKL, 101 &frac12;. deg. are knowen, wher|fore by my 13. chap. of triangles, the &s;ide IL &s;halbe founde 54 &frac12;. deg. which is the di&s;tance betweene 1. the pole zenith of the banke, and L the North pole, the complement whereof beeing LM, mu&s;t needes be the eleuation &s;ought for, vz. 35 &frac12; degr. Then for the angle of deflexion, you &s;hall vnder&s;tand that the &s;ame is the arch of any flats horizon comprehended betweene the meridian of the place, and the meridia~ of the flat: as in this figure AKB, is our meridian, be|cau&s;e he pa&s;&s;eth by the pole L, and our zenith <HI>K,</HI> and ILM, is the meridian of the bancke, becau&s;e it pa&s;&s;eth by the pole L, and the banks zenith I, by the defini|tion in the fir&s;t booke &amp; fourth chapter: and therefore the arche OM &s;halbe the degrees of deflexion, which to finde de&s;cant thus: &s;ince by the 5. booke &amp; 13. chap. you haue founde the &s;ide IL, of the triangle I<HI>K</HI>L, and al&s;o the angle IL<HI>K,</HI> or at lea&s;t if you haue not, you may: the angle OLM, is equal to it by the 5. theo|reme: the angle OML. is a right angle by the 3. def. and 3. theoreme. VVherfore to be &s;hort, here you haue the right angled triangle LMO, who&s;e one &s;ide LM, 35 &frac12; deg. &amp; his one angle not right OLM, are kno|wen: wherfore by the 5. bo. 9. cap. the &s;ide OM, &s;halbe found 28. de. Now la&s;tly to the angle of the meridia~s a&s;cen. which is the arch of any flats horiz. co~prehended between the meridia~ of your place, &amp; his ba&s;e line, which in this figure is the arch EO, for which you haue the right angled triangle EOA, of which the an|gle A is a right angle by the 3. def. &amp; 3. theor. &amp; the angle AEO, is knowen, becau&s;e by the 4. def. it is de|nominated by NH, being 34. deg. the co~plement of <HI>y^e</HI> recli. the &s;ide EA, is &s;aid before to be 11 &frac12; deg. where|fore by the 5. b. 9. c. you &s;hal find the &s;ide EO, 13 &frac12; deg. which is the angle of a&s;cen&s;. &s;ought for, &amp; &s;o is <HI>y^e</HI> &s;ide OA, 7 &frac12;. de. which is the mounting of our merid. aboue our hor. in this bank or flat, if we had need therof.</P>
<P>Many wayes might you de&s;cant vpon this figure, to come by the premi&s;es, as by a little exerci&s;e you &s;hall finde: as for the purpo&s;e another way, and that a &s;horter way, is thus: if you will begin with the meridians a&s;cen&s;ion, you may fir&s;t finde all the &s;ides and angles of the right angled triangle EAO, as I haue la&s;t before &s;hewed. And after that haue you the right angled triangle LMO, who&s;e one angle not right LOM, by the 5. theoreme is equall to the angle EOA, of the former triangle knowen, and the &s;ide OL, is knowe~ by &s;ub|ducting the &s;ide of the former triangle AO, out of AL, the 51 &frac23;. latitude. Therefore againe by the &s;aide 9. chap. you &s;hall know the &s;ide OM, which is the quantitie of the deflexion, and the &s;ide ML, the poles eleua|tion aboue the bank &s;ought for: &amp; &s;o I co~clude this chap. leauing the re&s;t to your diligent indeuour.</P>

</FIGURE> Then did I appoint the center of this diall in the lower angle Southwardes, vz. in A: In which point A, I placed the center of a woodden &s;e|micircle, which I had alwayes readie for &s;uche like purpo&s;es, his diameter being 3. foot in le~gth, which I laid euen in the ba&s;e line AB, as in this figure you &s;ee: for on the gra&s;&s;e I could make no blinde circle: whichdon, fa&s;tening a threed in the center A, I ex|tended the &s;ame &s;o many deg. aboue the ba&s;e line AB, in this wooden &s;emicircle, as our meridianes a&s;|cen&s;ion founde in the 25. or 26. chapter came to, vz. 13 &frac34;. deg. whiche threede or line cro&s;&s;eth the &s;ide BC, in E, this line AE, is the meridian too vs here at Reading or Aldermar&s;ton all is one, &s;o little differeth not being but 8. miles betweene: where|fore being &s;o, it mu&s;t needs be al&s;o the 12. a clock line, for in all dialles the 12. is in the meridian of the place: that done, I extende the threede from A, to &s;o many degrees in the &s;emicircle aboue the me|ridian AE, as the angle of deflection founde in the 25. or 26. commeth to, vz. 28. and it cro&s;&s;eth the &s;ide BC, in P, this line AP, is the place for the cock, and &s;o is this bancke prepared for this diall. Therefore nowe am I too betake mee too my <HI>Iewell,</HI> whence I mu&s;t fetch all the houres &s;paces. VVherefore I &s;et the <HI>Finitor</HI> vnder the pole according to the eleuatio~ of the bank found in the two la&s;t chapters, wher|on then I reckon the degrees of deflection, vid. 28. degrees from the <HI>limb</HI> inwardes, there I finde to cut the 43. meridian, which as I told you in the 19, chap. becommeth our meridian, and repre&s;enteth the line AE, in the bancke, the <HI>limb</HI> being in this ca&s;e the banckes meridian, vz. the line AP, wherfore you may proceed euen as you did in the declining diall imagining the meridian AE. to bee the plumbe line on the wall: as for example, I reckon on my <HI>Iewel</HI> too the 15. meridian from the &s;ame 43. meridia~ towards the <HI>limbe,</HI> which I find cutting in the <HI>Finitor</HI> 11 &frac12;. degr. for the fir&s;t houre, wherefore extending the threed from A to 11 &frac12;. deg. in the &s;aid &s;emicircle aboue the line AE, I draw there|by the fir&s;t houre for one of the clocke: and &s;o proceeding in all re&s;pectes with the re&s;t, euen as is done in the diall of the 24. chapter, as by this pre&s;ent figure doth more euidently appeare, then by manifolde words: wherein I haue &s;et to the degrees of euery houres &s;pace, for your better &s;atisfaction, Ther is no difference but that there I began the houres from the ba&s;e line, the rea&s;on was, for that the &s;ame was there the meridian.

<P>EVery man that hath yet taken vpon him to be the authour of diall making hath delighted too adde &s;ome noueltie of deui&s;e with them: as in Sconer, Orontius, &amp; Mun&s;ter you may &s;ee: of which the put|tyng in of the &s;ignes with the plenetarie houres, and &s;uch like hath beene mo&s;t taken vp and accounted of.

<P>AS it is a plea&s;ant thing by the la&s;t chap. to &s;et the houres in your dials too the longit. of other countries whereto they &s;erue: So no doubt, it is as plea&s;ant, or rather more plea&s;ant to know how to make a bo|dy, which &s;hal haue diuers flats &s;tanding both to the longi. &amp; lati. of what places you wil nominate. For if you make a body repleni&s;hed round with &s;undrie flats as well reclining inclining, &amp;c. vniformlie as the mo&s;t do, it is a chaunce if any of them an&s;weare any &s;peciall place you de&s;ire either in long. or latit. To per|forme this matter is harder then a man would take it for: it &s;pent me &s;ome &s;tudie at the fir&s;t to compa&s;&s;e it: but now I hope to lay it open enough to the learner. Admit therfore that I were to make a bodie of &s;undry flats looking euery way &s;ome vpwards, &s;ome downwards, &s;ome this way, &s;ome that way, as in times pa&s;t I haue done with great labor of &s;eeking the angles: which now by help of my <HI>Iewel</HI> I could do with more ea&s;e, and that in the &s;ame body I would place one flat exactly lying parallell &amp; leuell with the horiz. of Rome, that it might be &s;een how that horiz. lyeth vnto ours: the fir&s;t thing I do, I go to Ptolomes or Apia~s tables where I find the long. of Rome 37. deg. almo&s;t the lat. 41. de. 40. mi. Our longi. here at Reading is 14. well neer, our lat. 51 &frac23;. deg. then taking 14 out of 37. there re&s;teth 23. deg. the difference of long. of Rome fro~ Reading, &amp; that Ea&s;twards, bicau&s;e that lo~g. was greate&s;t. The&s;e had, you &s;hal with waxe fixe the <HI>labell</HI> 51-&frac23;. deg. vnder the zenith point of the <HI>reete</HI> leftwards, which point repre&s;enteth the pole, &amp; the <HI>label</HI> the <HI>Finitor</HI> &s;et to our lat. that done, count among the azi. ftom that part of the <HI>limb</HI> whereto the <HI>label</HI> is fixed the differ. of long. vz. 23. deg. &amp; on this 23. azi count from the zenith point downwards, the lat. of Rome, vz. 41. 40. there make a &s;ure prick with inke, for in that that the &s;aid 23. azi. &s;tandeth for the meridian or circle of lon|gitude of Rome, therefore that prick being that it boundeth the poles eleuation, there mu&s;t needes bee the North point of the horiz. of Rome. Now for that this 23. azi. commeth in towards the center, therefore hys pole zenith or Nadir mu&s;t needes bee the 23. deg. of the <HI>finit.</HI> beyond the center by the 5. bo. 24. ca. And be|cau&s;e the poles zenith &amp; Nadir of the merid. of any horiz. lye in the Ea&s;t &amp; VVe&s;t points of the &s;ame hor. therfore the &s;ame 23. deg. of the <HI>finit.</HI> &s;o cou~ted beyond the center &s;hall here be the Ea&s;t or VVe&s;t point of the hor. of Rome, &amp; in truth mu&s;t needes be here the VVe&s;t point if you conceiue it as wel as I do: wel then, ha|uing two pointes of the horiz. of Rome, vid. the North point being the pricke made with inke in the 23 azi. &amp; the VVe&s;t point being the &s;aid 23. deg. of the <HI>finit.</HI> you &s;hall turne about the <HI>reet</HI> &amp; <HI>label</HI> fixed together as before, till you &s;ee &s;ome one merid. of the <HI>mater</HI> to cut both tho&s;e points which you &s;hall find too bee the 17. merid. counted from the axtree.

Thus your <HI>Iewel</HI> beieng in an excellent con&s;titution for perfour|mance of this chap. you &s;hall count the degrees of the &s;aid 17. merid. from the &s;aid pricke in the 23. azimuth, which is there the merid. of Rome vnto our merid. being the <HI>limb.</HI> which deg. end in the pole point of the <HI>ma|ter</HI> which here is no pole but an inter&s;ection, you &s;hall finde them 16. which are the quantitie of the deflexion of this dyall by the def. in the 27. cap. then from the cro&s;sing of this 17. merid. with our merid. being as I &s;aid the pole counting on his &s;aide match merid. videlicet, the 17. merid. vnder the axtree till he cro&s;&s;e our hori&s;on being here the <HI>label,</HI> you &s;hall finde 24. degr. &amp; better, which is our meridians a&s;cen&s;ion in that flat which &s;halbe here &s;et to the hori&s;on of Rome, but both the&s;e angles are more then bargaine: for the drifte of this chap. was no more but to get the declinatio~ &amp; reclin. of this propo&s;ed flat, which you &s;hall al&s;o now haue &amp; tho&s;e into the vantange. Reckon therefore the deg. of the <HI>label</HI> between the <HI>limbe</HI> &amp; the la&s;t inter&s;ec|tion of the &s;aid match merid. the &s;ame you &s;hall find 23. deg. the complement whereof, vid. 67. being the de. of the <HI>label</HI> betwene the &s;ame inter&s;ection &amp; the center of the <HI>Iewel,</HI> is the declination of the ba&s;e line whiche mu&s;t needes be Ea&s;twards from the South, becau&s;e Rome lyeth that way from vs. Now for the reclination of this flat you &s;hall from the &s;aid la&s;t inter&s;ection in the <HI>label</HI> count on the &s;aid match merid. to the pole be|ing as is &s;aid 24. de. and &s;o round thence by the deg. of the other 17. merid. tyll you come to 90. which en|deth at 66. deg. thereof counted from the pole: directly ouer that 66. degr. make a pricke with inke on the <HI>Reete,</HI> then turne about the <HI>reete</HI> &amp; <HI>labell</HI> &s;til fixed till the <HI>label</HI> lye euen with the Equinoctialline, &amp; there your &s;hall finde the 22. &frac34; merid. counted from the axtree to cut the &s;aid prick la&s;t made in the <HI>reet</HI> ouer the &s;aid 66 or rather 90. degr. who&s;e deg. from the &s;ame prick counted to the pole, are 71 &frac12;. the reclination of this flat &s;ought for: the complement wherof being the deg. of the &s;ame 22 &frac34;. from the prick to the <HI>label,</HI> vz. 18 &frac12;. deg. is the mounting of the &s;ame flat aboue our horiz. in his ba&s;es perpendiculer. Thus in end (&s;ince the declinat. is found 67. deg. &amp; the reclination 71 &frac12;. deg.) I conclude that to place a flat here at Reading, leuel or parallel with the horiz. at Rome, that is to &s;ay, to agree with it both in longi. &amp; lat. the &s;ame mu&s;t be a South flat de|clining Ea&s;t 67. deg. reclining 71 &frac12;. deg. which by the 22. &amp; 23. chap. you may ea&s;ily knowe too &s;et, and by the 28. make the dial thereto, and by the la&s;t chapter place the houres of Rome.</P>

<P>SO wonderfull is the copie of operation by this in&s;trument that it is &s;trange &s;o much matter &amp; &s;o great varietie &s;hould be co~prehe~ded in &s;o &s;imple a thing as it is to behold. Truly I am &s;o drencht in the bowels of this <HI>Iewel</HI> that I know not almo&s;t which way to turn me, or whe~ to determine an end. For being now re|die to &s;end the&s;e 6. bo. to the pre&s;&s;e: there &s;odainely commeth into my head a farre ea&s;ier cour&s;e for all decli|ning reclining &amp; inclining dials of what &s;ort &s;oeuer: which for the mo&s;t part are very trouble&s;om by the 19. 20. &amp; 28, c. in numbring the houres from the new found meridian there. Verily were it not that I challenge the fir&s;t inuention of the former way, I might here euen blu&s;h to think what a compa&s;&s;e, I haue fetcht what extreeme paines &amp; &s;tudie it hath co&s;t mee too atchieue the &s;ame euen by the racking of the &s;pheare as I may terme it.

Neither am I to be more a&s;hamed of this then all other writers before me euen <HI>y^e</HI> princes of A&s;tronomie as &s;om of them haue been termed, are to be reproued in that all they haue not taught to make the&s;e bu&s;ie kind of dials by the v&s;e of either the Spheare, Globe, A&s;trolabe or any other in&s;trument as wel as they haue the other 2. ea&s;ie &amp; ordinarie dials. But now to the matter, fir&s;t you &s;hal vnder&s;tand that all declining dials, who&s;e making are taught in the 19. and 20. chapters, and all Ea&s;t and VVe&s;t reclining or inclining taught in the 25. cap. are in maner all of one &s;ort, that is to &s;ay, their flats repre&s;ent circles of po|&s;ition to &s;ome one lati. or other: as for example, all our declining walles repre&s;ent circles of po&s;ition to the 38 &frac13;. South latit. euen as our Ea&s;t &amp; VVe&s;t reclining flats are decli. walles to the &s;ame 38 &frac13; lati. as in the 25. cha. I &s;hewed: to al flats of both the&s;e &s;orts you &s;hal thus pre&s;ently make the diall without re&s;pect either of e|leuation or deflexion, which in all my other cap. mu&s;t be foreknowen. And for your better in&s;truction I wil here &s;hew to make in this maner a diall to the South decli. wall Ea&s;twards 16 &frac12;. de. mentioned in the 15. c. VVhich to do I place the <HI>finit.</HI> to our lat. vz. 51 &frac23;. deg. vnder the pole, then from the zenith line towardes the <HI>limbe</HI> I reckon on the <HI>finitor</HI> 16 &frac12;. deg. rightwards, there do I finde the 16 &frac12;. azimuth, whiche repre&s;enteth this wall propo&s;ed, or more plainely, the great circle or horizon in who&s;e flat this wall lyeth, &amp; is the 16 &frac12;. circle of po&s;ition, to tho&s;e that haue the South pole 38 &frac12;. de. eleuated, which being found let him there re&s;t awhile. And now I mu&s;t haue you (&s;ince I can a&s;&s;ure you that euery of the dials of this &s;ort are oblique dials) too call to remembrance the def. of an oblique diall mentioned in the 3. chap. &amp; the grounde &amp; rea&s;on whe~ce his lineaments proceed there al&s;o &s;hewed: &amp; then if you returne again with this imagination to the &s;aide 16 &frac12;. azi. where we left, you wil be redier to tel mee then I haue been hitherto to tel you, that the verye houre lines alreadie on your <HI>Iewel</HI> di&s;tingui&s;hed by fifteenes, mu&s;t needes deuide the &s;ame 16 &frac12;. azimuth in too hys horizontall &s;paces &s;eruing this diall: &s;ince the <HI>limbe</HI> is &s;till in this con&s;titution our merid. from whence the

You mu&s;t knowe although I heere teach too de&s;cribe your dials without fir&s;te &s;eeking the angles of eleuation and deflexion: yet for the height of the cocke and his place you mu&s;t, the di|all fini&s;hed, craue their acquaintance, and in the meane time haue a great regarde of them, of which too bee fully in&s;tructed, fir&s;t you mu&s;t note that on your <HI>Iewell</HI> any two azimuthes lying on eache &s;ide of the Zenith line, like di&s;taunt from it, doe by pro&s;pectiue rea&s;on make vppe and repre&s;ent one whole great circle of the &s;pheare, as in my &s;econde booke and the one and twentie chapter, I haue &s;omewhat largely touched, whe|ther re&s;ort, &s;o that this &s;aid 16 &frac12;. azimuth with his matche beyng the 16 &frac12;. azimuth counted from the zenith line on the other &s;ide doe make vp the whole horizon or great circle, wherein this wall lyeth.

<P>THe reclination and declination of any flat being propo&s;ed or el&s;e taken by the 23. Chap. you &s;hal ther|by get the angles of eleuation and deflexion as is taught in the 26. &amp; 27.

<P>For Example the bancke at Aldermar&s;ton his reclination found by the 23. Chap. to be 56. deg. and his de|clination in his ba&s;e line 78 &frac12; deg. whereby in the 26. and 27.

The&s;e had which you may alwayes haue without any paines for the looking on, I fir&s;t &s;et the <HI>Label</HI> to our latitude vz. 51 &frac23; deg. vnder the pole, then aboue the <HI>Label</HI> I &s;et the zenith of the <HI>Reete</HI> equal to our &s;aide meridians mounting vz. 7 &frac12; deg. towards the pole, &s;o is the pole eleuated aboue it 44 &frac16; degrees, and is our new latitude de&s;ired. Then counting from the zenith of the <HI>Reete</HI> among the Almicantares the quantitie of our meridians a&s;cention vz. 13 &frac23; deg. I finde the &s;ame 13 &frac23; almicant. to cut the <HI>Label</HI> in the 11 &frac12; deg. from the <HI>Limbe,</HI> which in truth is the complement of the declination as in the 31. Chapter it was, from which this con&s;titution now differeth not: but now in the &s;ame cro&s;sing of the &s;aide almicant. with the <HI>Label</HI> you &s;hall finde the 56 &frac23; azimuth to cut being the reclination de&s;ired: So that now if you keepe the zenith of the <HI>Reete</HI> fixed, you haue him readie placed at the new latitude euen as he was in the la&s;t Chapt. and the 56 &frac23; azimuth your de&s;ired horizon, wherefore let the <HI>Label</HI> now go his way, for the re&s;t is to be done without him by the 33. Chapt.</P>
<P>Note that if in &s;teede of the meridians a&s;cention among the almicantares you had here numbred on the <HI>La|bel</HI> the ba&s;e lines declination vz. 78 &frac12; deg. from the centre, or his complement vz. 21 &frac12; deg. from the <HI>Limbe,</HI> there had you found the &s;aid 56 &frac23; azimuth without re&s;pecting the a&s;cention.</P>
<P>Note al&s;o when by the &s;aid con&s;titution of the 26. Chapt. you &s;hal at any time conceiue that your meridi|an is depre&s;&s;ed vnder your horizon as in diuer&s;e ca&s;es it happeneth, then that which heere is the a&s;cention is called the de&s;cention, and that which here is the mounting is then the depre&s;sion.

Chapt. the de|flexion found the difference of longitude, which had I reckon this deflexion on the <HI>Limb</HI> of the <HI>Reete</HI> from the Zenith point, thereto I lay the <HI>Label</HI> whereon I count againe the latitude propo&s;ed inwards, and there cro&s;&s;eth the azimuth &s;hewing the po&s;ition reclination as I may terme it. And the degrees of the &s;ame azimuth be|tweene this cro&s;sing and the zenith point &s;heweth the po&s;ition latitude, that is to &s;ay, the latitude where|in the horizon of the place propo&s;ed is an Ea&s;t or We&s;t reclining flatte equall to this reclination founde or more plainely wherein he lyeth in that circle of po&s;ition, &s;uch a one as in the la&s;t two Chapters are mentio|ned. VVherefore taking this latitude out of yours, there re&s;teth the mounting of your meridian if your latitude be the greater, or the depre&s;sion if the le&s;&s;e, according to which if the <HI>Label</HI> and Zenith point be &s;et in manner of the la&s;t Chapt. the &s;ame azimuth at his cro&s;sing with the <HI>Label,</HI> if you count then&s;e to the centre, findeth out the ba&s;e lines declination of your propo&s;ed flat, and from the &s;ame cro&s;sing to the zenith point your meridians a&s;cention. And hauing nowe the&s;e, then if by the fir&s;t con&s;titution of the 26. Chapter you place the zenith line of the <HI>Reete</HI> according to this declination as there is taught: and then reckoning from the <HI>Limbe</HI> on the axtree line, the mounting of your meridian found, there &s;treight meeteth you the azimuth &s;hew|ing the true reclination in his ba&s;e lines perpendiculer &s;ought for. By example this will be more plaine which &s;halbe the example in the 31. Chap. of the &s;cituation or placing of the horizon of Roome, the latitude there|of being 41 &frac23; deg. and the difference of longitude from vs here at Reading 23. deg. both propo&s;ed: Fir&s;t I &s;et the <HI>Finitor</HI> to the 41 &frac23; latitude vz. 41 &frac23; vnder the pole, then from the <HI>Limbe</HI> among the meridians I count the difference of longitude vz. 23. this 23. meridian cutteth in the <HI>Finitor</HI> 16. deg. which is the angle of deflexion of the meridian of Rome from ours here in our countrie. The&s;e had I then reckon this angle of deflexion vz. 16. deg. on the <HI>Limbe</HI> of the <HI>Reete</HI> from the zenith point, thereto I lay the <HI>Label,</HI> nowe on the <HI>Label</HI> inwards I reckon the latitude of Roome vz. 41 &frac23; degrees, and there do I finde to cut the 73. azimuth counted from the <HI>Limbe</HI> which I call the po&s;ition reclination: And on the &s;ame 73. Azimuth from the cutting with the <HI>La|bel</HI> vnto the zenith of my <HI>Reete</HI> I finde 44 &frac14; degrees, which I call the po&s;ition latitude, that is to &s;ay, in that countrie where the latit. is 44 &frac14; degrees. The horizon of Rome is an Ea&s;t or VVe&s;t reclining or inclining flatte lying in one of the circles of po&s;ition there: therefore taking that latitude vz. 44 &frac14; out of our latitude vz. 51 &frac23; there re&s;teth 7 5/12 deg. the difference, which becau&s;e our latitude is the greater, is the mounting of our meridian in this flatte rightly placed. The&s;e knowne you &s;hall fir&s;t &s;et the <HI>Label</HI> to our latitude vz. 51 &frac23; deg. vnder the pole, then place the zenith of the <HI>Reete</HI> according to the other latitude vz. 44 &frac14; degrees vnder the

<P>Note that when you haue the po&s;ition reclination and latitude, and thereby the meridians mounting as before: you may &s;omwhat ea&s;ier get the true reclination and declination by a Sphericall triangle imagined &s;uch a one as AEO is in the 27.

Chapt. but fre&s;hly came vnto my minde as I was bu&s;ilie occupied in cut|ting the prints for this 6. book. Better it is that it come too late then neuer: I were be&s;t now to &s;ay that there be two cour&s;es in making of Dyals, Longation and Curtation, as the prie&s;t &s;aide to Baluinus in Era&s;mus Dialogue called <HI>Alcumistica,</HI> and that it was my chance to hit fir&s;t vpon Longation, as in my 19. 20. 25. &amp; 28.

Chap. vnto which the angle LOM is equall by the 5. theoreme and is our new reclination de&s;ired, called in the 34. and 35. the po&s;ition reclination. Then taking the arch AO out of AL, our latitude there re&s;teth LO this newe latitude de&s;ired called in the 34. and 35. the po&s;ition latitude. La&s;tly you haue the right angled triangle OLM who&s;e one angle not right LOM with the &s;ubtending &s;ide OL are knowne, wherefore by the 5. booke 9.

As for example: &s;in&s;e the latitude OL is 44 &frac16; and the angle KON 56 &frac23; deg. as in the 34.

<HEAD><HI>Chapter 41.</HI> To know in what Longitude and Latitude our horizon or any other &s;hall repre&s;ent any declining wall propo&s;ed, or els any circle of po&s;ition propo&s;ed.</HEAD>
<P>GOod God if I &s;hould bend my &s;elfe to inuent but &s;o many propo&s;itions to be performed on my <HI>Iewel</HI> as my cour&s;e capacity could accompli&s;h, I thinke I &s;hould &s;pend al my dayes in writing. For whiles I think to make ha&s;t to an end, I fare like a dog that goeth in a wheele hauing an endle&s;&s;e path to tread, let him make neuer &s;o much ha&s;te it helpeth him not til he fynd a meane to get him&s;elfe quite out. So I haue no other mean to come to an end, but euen here to &s;top and lay a &s;traw as they &s;ay for this time, this chapter being en|ded, which cannot but he &s;omewhat plea&s;urable. As if a man would know in what longitude and latitude
<PB N="123" REF="70"> our horizon here at Reading were a &s;outh wall declining Ea&s;t 30. deg. or els were the 30. circle of po&s;ition: euery man perhaps could not performe this, notwith&s;tanding all that which hath byn &s;aid. You &s;hall reckon our latitude on the <HI>Label</HI> from the <HI>Limbe</HI> inwards, and lay the &s;ame deg. on the 30. azimuth counted from the Zenith line and the degrees of the &s;ame 30. azimuth counted thence to the Zenith point &s;hall bee the latitude wherein our horizon is the 30. circle of po&s;ition, and the complement thereof &s;halbee the latitude wherein it is a wall declining 30. deg. And the deg. of the <HI>Reetes Limbe</HI> betweene the <HI>Label</HI> and the zenith point &s;hall bee the deflexion of the diall to that declination and circle of po&s;ition. La&s;tly, &s;et the <HI>Finitor</HI> vnder the pole accor|ding to our latitude, and thereon reckon inwardes the deflexion before founde, and the meridian cuttyng there the <HI>Finitor</HI> counted from the <HI>Limb</HI> &s;heweth the the difference of longit. which being added to ours &s;hew|eth the longit. de&s;ired.</P>
<P>As for example, our horizon here at Reading is in longit. 14. in latitude 51 &frac23;. deg. Fir&s;t I recko~ our latitude videl. 51 &frac23;. deg. on the <HI>Labell</HI> inwardes and apply the &s;ame degree of the <HI>Label</HI> to the 30. azim. counted from the zenith line, which cutteth off on the &s;aid 30. azim. 64 &frac23;. deg. counted thence to the zenith pointe of the <HI>Reete,</HI> and in the <HI>Limbe</HI> the <HI>Label</HI> cutteth 46. &frac23;. deg. cou~ted al&s;o from the zenith point, which are the deg. of de|flexion of which I will &s;peake anon. But before I proceede further, I conclude that the &s;aid 64 &frac23;. degr. are the deg. of latitude in that countrey where our horizon &s;hall lye in the 30. circle of po&s;ition counted there tow|ardes the zenith as the circles of po&s;ition are alwayes reckoned: then if you take the complement of the &s;aid 64 &frac23;. deg. vz. 25 &frac13;. deg. the &s;ame &s;halbe the latitude wherein our horizon &s;hall repre&s;ent a wall declining 30. deg. yet by your leaue you may be in doubt whether this be a South latitude or a North, but you &s;hall haue this rule general, if you once knowe whiche pole is eleuated aboue anye South or South declining wall, you may be &s;ure the contrary pole is eleuated in the latitude whereon that wal &s;tandeth, as here &s;eeing the North pole is eleuated 51 &frac23;. deg. you may be &s;ure where this our horizon &s;hall be a &s;outh or &s;outh declining wal, that countrey hath a South latitude: and therefore this 25 &frac23;. is a South eleuation. But in what longitude withal he &s;hal be a South wal, declining VVe&s;twards 30. deg. that &s;hall the deflexion helpe vs too, being 46 &frac23;. as I be|fore &s;aide. Therefore you &s;hall &s;et the <HI>Finitor</HI> according to the &s;ayde South latitude videl. 25 &frac13;. deg. vnder ey|ther pole, and thereon rrckon inwardes the &s;aide angle of deflexion vz. 46 &frac23;. deg. where you &s;hall finde the &s;aid 68. meridian counted from the <HI>Limbe</HI> to cro&s;&s;e the <HI>Finitor</HI> being the &s;ayde difference of longit. from ours. Now becau&s;e I propo&s;e our horizon to decline VVe&s;twards from the meridian of that 25 &frac13;. latitude, therfore I adde tho&s;e 68. deg. to our longi. being 14. it maketh 82. deg. the long. de&s;ired. So that hereby I conclude my purpo&s;e, affirming that our horizon here at Reading &s;hal repre&s;ent a South wall declining VVe&s;t 30. degr. in that countrey where as the longit. is 82. deg. and the South pole eleuated 25 &frac13;. deg. &amp; you do not beleue me me, goe thither and trye it. It is a prety walke for a recreation: wel, yet if you &s;ubduct 68. out of 14. (whiche without adding fir&s;t 360. thereto you cannot doe) &s;o is it 374. there re&s;teth then 306. the longi. of that cou~|trey where our &s;aid horizon is a South wall declining Ea&s;t 30. deg. the &s;ame latit. vz. 25 &frac13;. remayning &s;til. In the very &s;ame maner by hauing regard of the longitude, you may knowe where it is a North wall declining Ea&s;t or VVe&s;t 30. deg. &s;ince tho&s;e two are but oppo&s;ite to the&s;e.</P>
<P>Note that the &s;aid 30. circle of po&s;ition is the 60. reclining or inclining flat in the &s;aid 64 &frac23;. latit. but whe|ther you will haue him Ea&s;t or VVe&s;t reclining or inclining, that &s;hal you euen as ea&s;ily doe by taking regard of the differences of longitude in maner as before.</P>
<P>VVel then though in the 37. I likened my 19. 20. 25. and 28. chapters vnto longation, hauing &s;ince in &s;ome re&s;pectes lighted on Curtation, yet commeth this fruite (if it be ought worth) out of them: and they are in|troductions to diuers &s;uch like, for which cau&s;e I thought good not to omit this chapter although the 30. 36. and diuers other chapters came wholly of them, and therefore I repent not much my paynes.</P>

<P>THus gentle Reader, an hundred times heartily farewel, beeing &s;orye that my other 6. litle bookes of the <HI>Iewel</HI> be not ready to go to the pre&s;&s;e with the&s;e: but I hope by that time the&s;e &s;halbe throughly peru&s;ed to &s;end the re&s;t after &s;omwhat more indu&s;triou&s;ly performed, I feare &s;ome will take it vnkindly that tho&s;e bookes to come, being chiefly for the bent of this pre&s;ent time to be de&s;ired &s;hould bee kepte in.
