<P>After the progre&s;s of two &s;everal Treaties, the fir&s;t being in 1613. in <HI>London;</HI> and the other at the <HI>Hague</HI> in <HI>Holland,</HI> concerning matters of Trade between the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and <HI>Dutch</HI> in the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indies;</HI> and at length by a third Treaty in <HI>London,</HI> 1619. all differences in matter of Trade were compo&s;ed; and &s;olemn|ly agreed upon the future proceedings of both
<PB N="2" REF="5"> Companies in the <HI>Indies,</HI> as well in matter of Trade and Commerce, as otherwi&s;e: and in regard of the great blood &s;hed, and pretended co&s;t the Hollander had been at, in obtaining the Trade of the I&s;les of the <HI>Moluccos, Banda,</HI> and <HI>Amboyna</HI> from the <HI>Spaniards</HI> and <HI>Portugals,</HI> and in building of places of Strength to keep out the enemy, and all &s;uch as &s;hould oppo&s;e them; the &s;aid Hollanders &s;hould have the two third parts of the Trade, and the Engli&s;h the other third; and what&s;oever charges they were at in relation to their defence, &s;hould be impos'd upon the Merchandi&s;e. Wherefore in order to this Agreement, the E<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">gli&s;h <HI>Ea&s;t India.</HI> Compa|ny placed certain Factories for their part of Trade, &s;ome at the <HI>Mollucco's,</HI> &s;ome at <HI>Banda,</HI> and others at <HI>Amboyna;</HI> which la&s;t will prove the Scene of an unparellel'd Tragedy.</P>
<P>Now a little to digre&s;s, I will acquaint the Reader what part of the <HI>Indies</HI> this <HI>Amboyna</HI> lieth in: 'Tis an I&s;land adjacent to <HI>Seran,</HI> the compa&s;s about forty leagues, from whence &s;ome other I&s;lands derive their name; for Commo|dities, Cloves abound, and great Trade there is for them; for buying and gathering in thereof, the Engli&s;h Company had &s;etled five &s;everal Factories, the head and chief place of meeting was at this Town of <HI>Amboyna;</HI> where fir&s;t M. <HI>Geo, Mu&s;champ,</HI> and after him M. <HI>Gab.

<PB N="3" REF="5"> were Agents; to whom In&s;tructions were given for the Government of the &s;maller Facto|ries in the re&s;pective I&s;land, and the neibouring I&s;land of <HI>Seran.</HI></P>
<P>Upon the I&s;lands of <HI>Amboyna</HI> and point at <HI>Seran,</HI> the Dutch had fortified them&s;elves in four &s;everal places but their chiefe&s;t Fort was at the Town of <HI>Amboyna,</HI> which they had made impregnable, having four Bulwarks, and on each point &s;ix pieces of Ordnance mounted, upon the &s;ide of the Ca&s;tle the Sea beats, the other is di|vided from the Land with a kind of deep Graft of five fadom broad, exceeding deep and filled with the Sea. The Gari&s;on of this Ca&s;tle con|&s;i&s;ted of about two hundred Dutch &s;ouldiers, and a company of free Burgers, and about four hundred Mardijkers, for &s;o they call the free natives in the Town who are ready to &s;erve the Ca&s;tle at an hours warning; There likewi&s;e lay in the Road divers &s;trong <HI>Holland</HI> &s;hips as well for defence as Traffique. This being the place of general meeting, as well for the I&s;land of <HI>Banda,</HI> as the re&s;t of <HI>Amboyna.</HI> Here the Engli&s;h inha|bited, not in the Ca&s;tle, but under its protection, in an hou&s;e of their own, thinking them&s;elves &s;afe, and re&s;ting upon the credit of the Dutch; fir&s;t in re&s;pect of the affinity of both Nations; &s;econdly, in regard of the late Treaty.</P>
<P>Here they continued with a &s;eeming loving

<PB N="5" REF="6"> Treaty in 1619. In the interim the coals of di&s;|content increa&s;ed between the Engli&s;h and the Dutch, and there wanted not tho&s;e that kept them burning; for their differences augmented about the&s;e and other things, until at length the knot of concord was cut a&s;under by the &s;word of di&s;cord. The full relation take as followeth.</P>
<P>About the 11. of February <HI>&s;til. vet.</HI> a <HI>Japoni|an</HI> Souldier of the Dutch, in the Ca&s;tle of <HI>Am|boyna,</HI> walking in the night upon the Rampire, took an occa&s;ion to &s;peak to the &s;entinel (being an Hollander) and among other di&s;cour&s;e, asked him &s;ome que&s;tions touching the &s;trength of the Ca&s;tle, and concerning the people of the Gari|&s;on; but by the way 'tis here to be noted, that tho&s;e <HI>Japoneers,</HI> of whom there were not thirty in all the I&s;land, were for the mo&s;t part imploy|ed by the Dutch in the condition of Soldiers, yet were not of tho&s;e that they confided in, and al|waies lodged in the Ca&s;tle; but upon &s;ome ex|traordinary occa&s;ion were called out of the Town to do &s;ome duty in the watch; This <HI>Ja|poneer</HI> afore&s;aid was &s;u&s;pected upon his confe|rence with the &s;entinel, and apprehended upon &s;urmi&s;e of trea&s;on, and put to the water torture, whereby through extream angui&s;h and pain, and the cruel u&s;age of the tormentors he was brought to confe&s;s him&s;elf, and &s;ome of his Countrymen there, to have con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">pi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">ted the taking

<P>At the &s;ame time there was one <HI>Abel Price, Abel Price</HI> Chyrurgion of the Engli&s;h, for a mi&s;|examind demeanor of offering to fire a Dutch man's hou&s;e, this fellow the Dutch took, and &s;hewed him &s;ome of the <HI>J<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">poniers</HI> whom they had grievou&s;ly tortured, and to paliate their in|tentions and de&s;ignes upon the Engli&s;h, told him they had confe&s;&s;ed the Engli&s;h to be confederate with them in the taking of the Ca&s;tle; and if he would not confe&s;s, they would tor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">ure him wor&s;e then the <HI>Japoniers.</HI> He denies their accu|&s;ation, they put him to the torture, through the extremity whereof they &s;oon make him confe&s;s that which neither he or any of his Countrimen were ever guilty of; this was <HI>Febr.</HI> 15. 1622. <HI>Scil. vet.</HI> Soon after nine of the clock in the

They being come to the Governour, he told Captain <HI>Tower&s;on</HI> that him&s;elf and others of his Nation, were accu&s;ed of con&s;piracy about &s;urpri&s;al of the Ca&s;tle, and therefore till there could atte&s;t be made appear of their innocency, they mu&s;t remain in &s;afe cu&s;tody and &s;o were made pri|&s;oners.</P>
<P>Immediatly al&s;o they apprehended him that was left at home in the hou&s;e, and took all the Merchandi&s;e that belonged to the Engli&s;h Company into their cu&s;tody and took an Inven|tory of their goods; &s;ei&s;ing upon all their Che&s;ts, Boxes, Books, Writings, and other things that were in cu&s;tody of the Engli&s;h, or belonged to the Engli&s;h Merchants.

Then they commanded to make him fa&s;t again: and when he &s;aw he mu&s;t go to torture, he &s;aid all was true that they had &s;poken. Then the Fi&s;cal asked whether the Engli&s;h in the re&s;t of the Factors were not con&s;enting to this plot. He an&s;wered, No. The Fi&s;cal then asked him whether the Pre&s;ident of the Engli&s;h at <HI>Jac|catra,</HI> or M. <HI>Welden</HI> Agent in <HI>Bandu,</HI> were not plotters con&s;enting to this bu&s;ine&s;s.

Whereat when <HI>Collings</HI> was at a &s;tand, he devi&s;ed with him|&s;elf &s;ome probable fiction.

<PB N="17" REF="12"> La&s;tly, he asked when this plot &s;hould have been effected.

<P>Next, in order to our Tragedie, was <HI>Samu|el Col&s;on</HI> examined, being brought before them, having newly arrived from <HI>Hitto,</HI> as is before touched; who being the &s;ame day brought to the torture, was &s;o appaled at the &s;ight of <HI>Collins,</HI> (who&s;e eyes were blown out of his head with the torture of water) that he cho&s;e rather to confe&s;s all they asked him, then to be tortured: and &s;o he was di&s;mi&s;&s;ed; but he went out weeping, prote&s;ting his innocency.</P>
<P>Now comes <HI>John Clerk,</HI> who came with <HI>Col&s;on</HI> from <HI>Hitto,</HI> to be examined, and put to the torture, &s;o that he was heard by tho&s;e without the hall to cry out in an extreme man|ner; for they tortured him with fire and water for the &s;pace of two hours. The manner of his torture, as al&s;o of <HI>John&s;ons</HI> and <HI>Tom&s;ons,</HI> was as followeth. Fir&s;t, they twi&s;ted him up by the hands with a cord on a large door, where they made him fa&s;t to two &s;taples of iron, fixt on both &s;ides on the top of the door-po&s;ts, &s;tretch|ing his hands a&s;under as wide as they could: and being thus made fa&s;t, his feet hung about
<PB N="18" REF="13"> two foot from the ground, which al&s;o they extended as far as they could, and &s;o made them fa&s;t unto the bottom of the door. Then they bound a cloth about his neck and face, &s;o clo&s;e, that little or no water could go by. When they had done this, they poured the water &s;oftly upon his head, until the cloth was full up to his mouth and no&s;trils, &s;o that he could not draw his breath, but he mu&s;t &s;uck in the water; which being &s;till continued to be poured in &s;oftly, forced his intrails to come out at his eyes ears, and no&s;e, almo&s;t to &s;trang|ling. Never were there &s;uch horrid cruelties exerci&s;ed among the Turks and Barbarians, as among tho&s;e that pretend Chri&s;tianity. They were &s;o cruel to him, that they tormented him till his breath was gone, &s;o that he fainted: then they took him quickly down, and made him vomit up the water; and being a little recovered, they pull'd him up again, and char|ged him with the water again, till they had &s;tifled him as before: and this was exerci&s;ed on this poor wretch three or four &s;everal times, till his body was &s;woln twice as big as ordina|ry, his cheeks puft up like a pair of bladders, and his eyes &s;tarting and &s;trutting out beyond his forehead. Yet &s;uch was the con&s;tancie of this poor &s;oul, that, rather then he would con|fe&s;s, or betray any of his Country-men, he
<PB N="19" REF="13"> weuld &s;uffer all the injuries could be inflicted upon him; in&s;omuch that the Fi&s;cal and Tor|mentors reviled him, &s;aying he was a devil; (when indeed they &s;hewed them&s;elves to be &s;o) and that no man but a Witch could endure &s;uch torments: wherefore they, in relation to &s;ome Charms about him, cut off his hair &s;hort from his head, and hoy&s;ed him up again as before. Then they burnt him with lighted Candles in the bottom of his feet, until the fat dropt out the Candles: yet, as if the&s;e cruel|ties had not been enough, they called for fre&s;h lights, and applied them unto him. They burnt him al&s;o under the elbows; likewi&s;e in the palms of his hands: they moreover burnt his arm-holes, till his intrails might be &s;een. At length, when they &s;aw all their cruelties could not do any good upon him to make him con|fe&s;s of him&s;elf, they led him along with circum|&s;tances plotted and contrived by them&s;elves; and being thus wearied and overcome by the torment, he (rather then he would &s;uffer more) an&s;wered Yea to what&s;oever they asked him. The confe&s;&s;ion that they drew from him, was to this effect, <HI>viz.</HI> that Captain <HI>Tower&s;on</HI> had, upon New-yeers day la&s;t before, &s;worn all the Engli&s;h at <HI>Amboyna</HI> to be &s;ecret, and to be a&s;&s;i&s;tant to a plot that he had projected, with the help of the <HI>Japoners,</HI> to take the Ca&s;tle,

<P>The <HI>Japoners</HI> were fir&s;t cruelly tortered to accu&s;e <HI>Greggs,</HI> which after a great deal of torture, were con&s;trained, in hope to avoid the cruelty of the torture, to accu&s;e <HI>Griggs,</HI> to avoid the torture, confe&s;&s;ed all that he was de|manded.</P>

<P>All which writings are extant in very good hands.</P>
<P>The &s;ix and twentieth of February, <HI>Stilo veteri,</HI> the pri&s;oners were brought into the great Hall of the Ca&s;tle, only Captain <HI>Tower&s;on, Emanuel Tom&s;on,</HI> were to be prepared to death by the Mi|ni&s;ters.</P>
<P>As for the <HI>Japoners</HI> in generall, they cry out un|to the Engli&s;h concerning this plot: Oh you Eng|li&s;h men, where did we ever in our lives eat with you, talk with you, or to our remembrance &s;ee you? the Engli&s;h men an&s;wered, why then have you accu&s;ed us? the poor men perceiving they were made believe, each had accu&s;ed others, be|fore they had done &s;o, and &s;hewed them their tor|tured and ma&s;&s;erated bodies, and &s;aid, <HI>if a stone were thus burrt would it not change his nature? how much more we that are but fle&s;h and bloud.</HI></P>
<P>While&s;t they were all in the Hall, Captain <HI>Tow|er&s;on</HI> was called to examination, and two Jarres of water carried after him to fright him, but what they did to him no man knows, but they made him &s;ub&s;cribe.</P>

<P>After the Governour had &s;upped, <HI>John Powell, Ephraim Ram&s;ey, Thomas Ladbrook,</HI> and <HI>John Sad|ler,</HI> who were found not guilty, were taken from the re&s;t, and put into another room, pre&s;ently <HI>Sa|muel Col&s;on</HI> and <HI>Edward Collins</HI> were brought from the re&s;t, and put where <HI>Emmanuel Tom&s;on</HI> lay. The Fi&s;call told them though they de&s;erved little mercy, yet it was the Governours mercy to &s;ave one of them three, and 'twas not to him which he &s;aved, but it was his plea&s;ure they &s;hould draw lots for it, which they did, and it fell upon <HI>Edward Collins</HI> to be &s;aved, who was then carried to <HI>John Powells</HI> Chamber, where the re&s;t lay that were quit, he was told he was beholding to <HI>Peter John&s;on</HI> the Dutch Merchant of <HI>Loho,</HI> and to the Secretary, for they had beg'd his life.</P>
<P>Now there remained in the Hall ten of the Eng|li&s;h, for <HI>Tower&s;on</HI> and <HI>Tom&s;on</HI> were kept in rooms by them&s;elves, apart from the re&s;t.</P>
<P>To tho&s;e in the Hall the Dutch Mini&s;ters came, and they admoni&s;ht them to confe&s;&s;e unto the world what they were guilty of, for their time was but &s;hort, and to di&s;&s;emble now with God 'twould lie heavy upon their con&s;ciences, and took the Sacrament thereon, but e&s;pecially as a &s;eal of the forgivene&s;&s;e of their &s;ins, and to &s;how to the world their innocency: but by the way <HI>Samuel Col&s;on</HI> &s;pake to the Mini&s;ter, &s;aying, <HI>you tell us of the danger of di&s;&s;imulation, but tell us if we &s;uffer guiltle&s;&s;e, being otherwi&s;e true believers in Christ Je|&s;us,

<P>Upon this &s;peech of <HI>Col&s;ons</HI> all the re&s;t of the pri&s;oners &s;tood up, and &s;ignified their con&s;ent to his &s;peech: then &s;pake <HI>Fardo</HI> to the re&s;t in pre&s;ence of the Mini&s;ters, as followeth, <HI>Countreymen and Brethren, all you that are condemned to die, I charge you all as you will an&s;wer it at the dreadfull day of Iudgement, if any of you be guilty of this we are ac|cu&s;ed, clear your con&s;ciences, and &s;peak the truth to &s;atisfie the world.</HI></P>

When this was done, every one went to imbrace each one whom he had accu|&s;ed, and beg'd forgivene&s;&s;e of one another, for their fal&s;e accu&s;ation being extorted from them by the pains of fear and torture, and they all freely forgave one another, for none had &s;o fal&s;ly accu|&s;ed,

<P>After this they &s;pent the re&s;t of the dolefull night in Prayer, and &s;inging of P&s;almes, comfort|ing one another, though the Dutch that guarded them offered them wine, and bid them drink lu|&s;tick and drive away the &s;orrow according to their cu&s;tome, but 'twas contrary to the nature of the Engli&s;h.</P>
<P>The next morning being the execution day, 27. of February, <HI>Stilo veteri, John Powell</HI> being freed, as is above recited, came into the room where the condemned per&s;ons were, and found them at prayers: they all de&s;ired him to relate to their friends, how they vvere put to death for that they vvere never guilty of, taking upon their deaths that vvhat&s;oever they had confe&s;&s;ed concerning them&s;elves, or accu&s;ing of others vvas fal&s;e, and only done to avoid the cruell torments they vvere put to.</P>

<P><HI>Emanuel Tom&s;on</HI> hearing that <HI>Beomont</HI> was par|doned, de&s;ired that he might &s;peak with him, which he obtained with much entreaty. <HI>Beomont</HI> found him in his Chamber in a mi&s;erable conditi|on, with his wounds bound up, but the matter and bloud i&s;&s;uing through the Rowler; he took <HI>Beo|mont</HI> by the hand, and prayed him when he came into England to do his duty to the honorable Company, his Ma&s;ters, to Mr. <HI>Robin&s;on,</HI> and his brother <HI>Billing&s;ley,</HI> and to certifie his innocency by his own knowledge.</P>
<P>All things being prepar'd for execution, the pri&s;oners were brought forth of the Hall, by the chamber where the quit men were, who took their farewell of their Countreymen now going to ex|ecution, and &s;taying a little before the chamber, they charged tho&s;e that were their friends to bear witne&s;&s;e to their friends of their innocency, and that they were meerly murthered by the Hollan|ders upon a pretended trea&s;on, whom he pray'd God to forgive.</P>

<P>The Dutch had prepared a black cloth of velvet for Captain <HI>Tower&s;ons</HI> body to fall upon, which being defaced with his bloud, was put to the ac|count of the Engli&s;h Company.</P>

<P>The day following, <HI>Iohn Beomont,</HI> and <HI>George Sharrock, Edward Collins, William Webber</HI> were brought to the Governor, who told them they were pardoned in honor of the new Generall, and <HI>Collins</HI> he was to go to Jaccatra to &s;tand to the fa|vour of the Generall, &s;o the Governor made them drink wine with him, and di&s;mi&s;s'd them, and bid them go and con&s;ult with tho&s;e that were &s;aved, who were fit to be planted in the re&s;t of the facto|ries.</P>
<P>Which done, he accordingly appointed them each to their place, adding that he would hence|forth take upon him the patronage of the Engli&s;h Companies bu&s;ine&s;&s;e; to which purpo&s;e he had in|tercepted a letter come from the Engli&s;h Pre&s;ident at Jaccatra to <HI>Tower&s;on,</HI> wherein he found nothing whereby to accu&s;e rhem, but &s;aid he was glad that the Engli&s;h at Jaccatra were innocent in this bu&s;i|ne&s;&s;e.</P>
<P>The Governor and Fi&s;call having thus made an end at Amboyna, di&s;patched them&s;elves for Ban|da, where they made enquiry again&s;t Captain <HI>Wel|den,</HI> the Engli&s;h Agent there, yet found nothing to accu&s;e him ju&s;tly of, but at la&s;t courteou&s;ly en|tertained him, and told him they were glad they found him as well as the Engli&s;h at Jaccatra with|out &s;u&s;pition of trea&s;on: Captain <HI>Welden</HI> taking into con&s;ideration the great di&s;order of the Eng|li&s;h Companies at Amboyna, by rea&s;on of the&s;e practi&s;es, goes to Amboyna in a Dutch Pinnace,
<PB N="40" REF="25"> which he hired at Banda, where he recalled the Companies &s;ervants, &s;ent as before this to the un|der Factories.</P>
<P>And having enquired of the whole proceedings lately pa&s;&s;ed, he found by the agreeing &s;peeches of them all, there was no &s;uch trea&s;on as was pretend|ed, as al&s;o hearing what &s;trict charge the Governor had left to the &s;urviving Engli&s;h, not once to talk about this bloudy bu&s;ine&s;&s;e, although they were daily reproached by the Countrey people of trea|&s;on, and a bloudy intent to have murthered all the Natives, and to have ripped up women with child, and &s;uch fopperies did the Dutch po&s;&s;e&s;&s;e the vul|gar, to make the Engli&s;h odious to them. M. <HI>Welden</HI> holding it neither for the honor and profit of the Engli&s;h Company to continue at <HI>Amboyna,</HI> he took his poor remnant of the Engli&s;h with him in his Pinnace, and went for Jaccatra, whether the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">o|vernor had &s;ent <HI>Iohn Beomont</HI> and <HI>Edward Collins</HI> as condemned men to &s;tand to the mercy of the Generall.</P>
<P>When this news of Amboyna came to Jaccatra, and the Engli&s;h Pre&s;ident &s;ent to the Generall of the Dutch, to know by what Authority the Go|vernour of Amboyna u&s;ed the Engli&s;h thus, and how he and the re&s;t of the Dutch re&s;ent it;</P>

<P>Hitherto gentle reader ha&s;t thou the bare and naked Narration of the progre&s;&s;e of the&s;e actions, of the date, and for the truth of them, as 'tis taken from the Depo&s;itions of the &s;ix Engli&s;h factors, whereof four condemned, and the other two quit|ted in the proce&s;&s;e at Amboyna, all &s;ince returned into England, examined upon Oath in the Admi|ralty Court; <HI>Tower&s;ons</HI> and <HI>Tom&s;ons</HI> examinations are not yet come to light, becau&s;e they were kept from all the re&s;t, and not any of the Engli&s;h &s;uffe|red to come neer them, except that &s;hort farewell which <HI>John Beomont</HI> took of <HI>Tom&s;on</HI> the morning before the execution then mentioned.</P>
<P>But becau&s;e the Hollander will &s;eem to palliat their cruelties over Engli&s;h Merchants, as they ac|knowledge their trea&s;ons under their hands; 'twill not be impertinent to recall certain circum&s;tances from what hath been related, whereby to clear the Engli&s;h from any &s;uch crime as was laid to their charge.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, Let's remember the Japons were apprehen|ded and tortured three or four daies before the Engli&s;h were troubled, and their torture were known in Amboyna, for what they were u&s;ed &s;o,
<PB N="42" REF="26"> and <HI>Tom&s;on</HI> went into the Ca&s;tle to ask leave of the Governor to land &s;ome rice, ju&s;t as the Japo|ners were in their torture, and brought back the news to the Engli&s;h hou&s;e, of the cruell handling of the Japons, which if they had been guilty, they might with ea&s;e have e&s;caped by the Corricorries or &s;mall boats that lie along the Strand, but in that they fled not, it proves their innocency.</P>
<P>Next how unpo&s;&s;ible 'twas for the Engli&s;h to take this Ca&s;tle, &s;eeing it was of &s;uch great &s;trength, how vigilant they were upon the watch to take a|larum at the fooli&s;h word of a Japon, and how they &s;hot one of their own &s;ouldiers to death for &s;leeping on the watch. Dur&s;t ten Engli&s;h men, whereof not one &s;ouldier, do you think, attempt &s;uch a &s;trength, having but three &s;words in the Engli&s;h hou&s;e, when &s;eized on, and half a pound of powder two muskets? &s;o the&s;e Japons were not &s;uffered to bear arms, but in the Ca&s;tle, and in their &s;ervice, and none to &s;el them arms nor powder but on great penalty, no Ships in the Harbor of the Engli&s;h, not twenty Japons in the I&s;land, and not many more Engli&s;h, the re&s;t of the Engli&s;h forty leagues off, and tho&s;e but nine per&s;ons, which were afterward clear'd by the Governor him&s;elf, 'twas not likely that the&s;e could &s;urprize a Ca&s;tle of &s;uch &s;trength, and tho&s;e at Jaccatra likewi&s;e.</P>
<P>Again, the Hollander hath three other &s;trong, Ca&s;tles in the I&s;land vvell furni&s;h'd vvith &s;ouldiers and eight Ships in the harbor, be&s;ides a Pinnace, al|though
<PB N="43" REF="26"> the Engli&s;h have been approved for their valiant acts, vvhich the Hollanders are vvitne&s;&s;e of forth it &s;ervice done them again&s;t the King of Spain, yet that &s;o fevv per&s;ons, and unarmed, &s;hould be imagined to &s;urprize &s;uch a Ca&s;tle, to me &s;eemeth incredible.</P>
<P>But let it be granted they might have obtained it, to what end &s;hould they endanger them&s;elves, vvhen the Companies had agreed the Forts &s;hould remain in the hands of tho&s;e in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, and they had the Kings Maje&s;ties, and Lords States General to ratifie it, vvhat peace could they expect to keep in.</P>
<P>But let the&s;e Engli&s;h men be &s;o fooli&s;h in their plot, that vvhen they vvere condemned to die, and at the hour of their execution to per&s;i&s;t to ju&s;tifie their innocency, to a di&s;&s;imulation, and to &s;pend their time in prayer, and to take the Sacrament on it, that they were free, and asking one another for|givene&s;&s;e for their accu&s;ing one another, and their conjuring one another to di&s;charge their con&s;cien|ces, craving Gods mercy or judgement according to their innocency, and to do this in the point of death, what horrid di&s;&s;imulation had there been, if &s;ome one had been &s;o de&s;perate among&s;t ten, but all to agree and prote&s;t their innocency? What hope had they when they &s;aw <HI>Tower&s;ons</HI> head cut off, what hope had they to live, nay, why &s;hould they de&s;ire it, being &s;o mortified, it was no time to di&s;&s;emble with God then, when they mu&s;t an&s;wer it at his Tribunall to me this &s;eemes a rid|dle that they &s;hould be guilty.</P>
<PB N="44" REF="27">
<P>But now to colour this bu&s;ine&s;&s;e over, and to &s;mooth their barbarous proceedings, it is given out, the Governor and Fi&s;call found &s;uch evidence of the plot, &amp; proceeded &s;o evidently, that they &s;pa|red not their own Countrey men, partakers of the trea&s;on, in the &s;ame manner as the Engli&s;h: but this as the relation is true, and grounded on &s;worn te&s;timony of &s;ix credible Witne&s;&s;es, and as many Merchants of quality that come from tho&s;e parts can te&s;tifie.</P>
<P>And what the Hollander can do to colour the&s;e their barbarous proceedings, it is but the un&s;atia|ble covetou&s;ne&s;&s;e of the Hollander to obtain the whole trade of the Molucccos, Banda, and Am|boyna, which is now become the event of this bloudy proce&s;&s;e.</P>
<P>Now to conclude in a word, gentle Reader, I have given thee a true relation of a fact &s;o odious and barbarous, and inhumane, executed by Hol|landers upon the Engli&s;h, in a place where both lived in a &s;eeming amity of partner&s;hip, and con|firmed by a mo&s;t &s;olemn treaty, it mu&s;t needs ca&s;t an <HI>Odium</HI> upon them, and never to be forgotten by a true born heroick &s;pirited Engli&s;h-man.</P>
