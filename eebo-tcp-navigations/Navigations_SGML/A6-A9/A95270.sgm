<HEAD>A TRUE RELATION OF SUCH Pa&s;&s;ages as hapned in the Iourney Undertaken by the Baron of <HI>SUERIN,</HI> and the Honourable M^r <HI>WEYMAN, Deputies</HI> on the behalf of the <HI>Prince Elector</HI> of <HI>Bran|denburg</HI> to the <HI>King of Sweden.</HI></HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">In the Moneths of <HI>May</HI> and <HI>June</HI> 1658.</HEAD>
<P>IT is not without a great deal of <HI>regret,</HI> that we are <HI>enforced</HI> to begin this Relation by complaints, again&s;t tho&s;e who are the cau&s;es of the de&s;olation of our beloved and dear Countrey: But its the very la&s;t extremity which exacts them at our hands, and which obligeth us to make a &s;ad refle|ction on the pitifull e&s;tate wherein we have &s;een <HI>Germany</HI> in|gaged, by the Forces of tho&s;e, who, <HI>under the cloak of Liberty and Religion,</HI> have in &s;uch a lamentable manner extenuated that <HI>fair body,</HI> as they have left it but a bare <HI>skeleton:</HI> there is not &s;o de&s;picable a <HI>German,</HI> who hath but one &s;ole drop of bloud left in his veins, that cannot be &s;en&s;ible hereof, and who can cea&s;e from &s;ighing, at the reher&s;all of the calamities wherewithall his Countrey hath been afflicted. <HI>We have dearly bought our Sla|very, at the expence of our E&s;tates, our Goods, our Bloud, our Honour, and our reputations; and we have forgot what we once our &s;elves were, to e&s;tabli&s;h the Names of tho&s;e, who were &s;carce ever heard of, le&s;s known in the Empire. Nor have they onely &s;etled the Seats of their Dominion on our Frontiers, but even our faire&s;t and mo&s;t beautifull Provinces along the Elve, the We&s;er, and the Oder, do groan under the intollerable captivity of their Government; Strangers do triumph over our Liberties,</HI> and they make a mocking&s;tock of Religion, while&s;t under the pretence thereof, they have po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed them|&s;elves
<PB N="2" REF="3">of all <HI>Pomerania,</HI> and tho&s;e other great E&s;tates and Ter|ritories which they enjoy in the re&s;t of the <HI>Empire.</HI></P>
<P>It &s;eemed that at length God would have pity on us, and that by <HI>the Peace of Mun&s;ter</HI> he would in &s;ome manner disbur|burden us of our mi&s;eries; wherfore all men did generally return their thanks and acknowledgments to the Almighty thereon, &s;ince all men beleeved they might have enjoyed their own in peace, and might have reaped the fruit of their labours in quiet, under their own vines and figg-trees; and tho&s;e who had overwatched and outlaboured them&s;elves during the la&s;t commotions and di&s;orders, hoped now to carry their hoary heads in peace to their graves.</P>
<P>But the <HI>Swedi&s;h Seepter</HI> was no &s;ooner departed the hands of a Woman, whenas it became <HI>a burning torch</HI> in the hands of her Succe&s;&s;or, to kindle again the wars in <HI>Germany;</HI> the fir&s;t &s;parkles whereof appeared in the Swedi&s;h Forces before <HI>Bre|men,</HI> and the full flames not long after bur&s;t out throughout all <HI>Poland,</HI> that famous Kingdom, which &s;o often, and &s;o glo|riou&s;ly &s;tood in &s;tead of a bulwark and defence to all Chri&s;ten|dom; being on all &s;ides at once &s;et upon by an infinite num|ber of &s;trangers, craved the aid and a&s;&s;i&s;tance of all the world; whenas, <HI>this pre&s;ent King of Sweden,</HI> took his time to fall upon its back, whil&s;t it was involved in a warre with all tho&s;e other <HI>Barbarians;</HI> and entring it, <HI>by the way of its Prote&s;tant Provin|ces,</HI> did menace it with no le&s;s then <HI>a totall de&s;truction;</HI> which it e&s;caped by a meer miracle: for as all the world mu&s;t needs know, had not the Almighty put to his helping hand, we had not &s;een it in the condition it is in at this day.</P>
<P><HI>His Elector all Highne&s;s of Brandenburg,</HI> having born the great|e&s;t brunt of the&s;e di&s;a&s;ters, fore&s;eeing that this fire was like to con&s;ume the be&s;t part of Chri&s;tendom, u&s;ed his po&s;&s;ible en|deavours <HI>to &s;tifle it in the embers;</HI> and after it had blazed forth, <HI>by his earne&s;t and frequent be&s;eeching the King of Sweden,</HI> to reflect on the con&s;equences of this bu&s;ine&s;s, and the abominable &s;can|dall which would be given to all the world, <HI>by &s;o unju&s;t an In|va&s;ion,</HI> and even moved him to give ear to a rea&s;onable and advantagious Peace: but in&s;tead of gaining upon the <HI>&s;aid Kings minde,</HI> his <HI>Electorall Highne&s;s</HI> found him&s;elf nece&s;&s;itated to leavy
<PB N="3" REF="3">Forces, as well for the defence of his own Territories, which were a&s;&s;aulted by the <HI>Swedes,</HI> as to comply with that obliga|tion he &s;tood engaged in, unto <HI>the Crown of Poland.</HI> True it is, that the &s;ucce&s;s was not an&s;werable to his expectations, nor to the ju&s;tice of his Forces; but an extream nece&s;&s;ity, and an overpowring Force, con&s;trained his Highne&s;s <HI>to treat with the</HI> Swedes, <HI>and to agree with them in &s;uch a manner as they them&s;elves would; and tht fatall misfortune of Poland,</HI> brought a generall re|volution on the whole Kingdom, in which it &s;eemed, that all the &s;everall E&s;tates and Orders thereof, generally, and unani|mou&s;ly con&s;pired, to the ruin of that Crown.</P>
<P>Now, <HI>his Electorall Highne&s;s wanting the Power of a Protector in chief, nece&s;&s;ity</HI> did in &s;ome manner di&s;pence with him in the duty of a va&s;&s;all; &s;o that his waring again&s;t <HI>Poland,</HI> may be in &s;ome way excu&s;ed, by the enforced nece&s;&s;ity which plunged him therein: however, both <HI>Poland</HI> and <HI>Sweden</HI> do full well know, that amid&s;t the greate&s;t &s;ucce&s;&s;es of the Swedi&s;h Armies, and even during tho&s;e Triumphs, in which his <HI>Electorall High|ne&s;s</HI> might ju&s;tly claim &s;o great a part, he had alwayes a heart bent to Peace, and continually embraced the Propo&s;als thereof with joy.</P>
<P>In&s;omuch that the Polonian affairs, meeting with &s;uch a change, by rea&s;on of the Denmark Warre, the King of <HI>Sweden</HI> was forced to quit <HI>Pru&s;&s;ia,</HI> and in a manner, to relinqui&s;h and renounce tho&s;e Treaties which he made with his <HI>Electorall Highne&s;s,</HI> whom the King him&s;elf coun&s;elled, <HI>to heed his own affairs, and to prevent tho&s;e di&s;a&s;ters which threatned the Ducall Pru&s;&s;ia, by the be&s;t means he could.</HI> And accordingly by his &s;aid Maje&s;ties coun&s;ell, his Electorall Highne&s;s, took his re&s;olution on the pre&s;ent conjuncture of affairs, and did again <HI>reconc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">le him&s;elf to the Crown of Poland;</HI> with this Provi&s;o however, <HI>That both Parties &s;hould chiefly minde the Peace with Sweden;</HI> and that in ca&s;e either, or both were &s;o unfortunate as not to bring their good intentions to a de&s;ired effect, as then, his <HI>Electorall Highne&s;s</HI> &s;hould remain in a full and entire liberty, <HI>to act in the Empire, in relation to his own Intere&s;t, and in conformity to the Peace of Mun&s;ter.</HI></P>
<P>And immediately, notice was given hereof to the <HI>King of
<PB N="4" REF="4">Sweden,</HI> and it was repre&s;ented unto him, That by rea&s;on of the complying with the &s;aid Treaty, his <HI>Electoral Highne&s;&s;e</HI> could not any longer give the Swedi&s;h Troopes pa&s;&s;age through his Territories; nor permit that any prohibited Mer|chandi&s;es &s;hould be unloaden in his Ports. And his Maje&s;ty was at the &s;ame time reque&s;ted to think upon the <HI>Peace with Poland,</HI> a&s;&s;uring him that it might be obtained on very advan|tagious Termes for the <HI>Swedes:</HI> Whereupon the &s;aid King declared unto his <HI>Electoral Highne&s;&s;e,</HI> That he was very much inclined thereunto; a&s;&s;ured the States of <HI>&V;pper-Saxony,</HI> who were a&s;&s;embled at <HI>Liep&s;ig, That he would no more march through the Empire into Poland,</HI> and told <HI>Moun&s;ier de Lombres</HI> (the French Amba&s;&s;adour, who alwaies mo&s;t vigorou&s;ly &s;econded the King his Ma&s;ters good intentions, towards the procuring of a Peace betwixt the two Crownes) That he would not only re&s;tore <HI>Pru&s;&s;ia,</HI> by reimbur&s;ing it in a manner for the charges of the War, but that al&s;o he would immediately nominate his Plenipotentiaires to Treat on the Peace with <HI>Poland:</HI> All which Declarations, gave great hopes for a Peace in the North.</P>
<P>But, <HI>the King and Crown of Poland,</HI> con&s;idering that the King of <HI>Sweden</HI> would obtain a great advantage from &s;uch a meet|ing to the above-&s;aid purpo&s;e, by <HI>the jealou&s;ie which the</HI> Mu&s;co|vites would <HI>harbour thereon,</HI> and by the ju&s;t cau&s;e which the other Allyes would have to complain of &s;uch a particular Treaty; they thought it not fitting to engage them&s;elves in &s;uch like Negotiations, the event whereof was very uncer|tain, and would ruine them, in the opinion of all their Friends. And indeed, they perceived that the King of <HI>Sweden</HI> would not explain him&s;elf, as to the &s;umme which he demanded for recompence of <HI>Pru&s;&s;ia.</HI> And finally, That &s;ince his &s;ucce&s;&s;es in <HI>Denmark,</HI> he required &s;o immen&s;e a &s;umme, as was altoge|ther unpo&s;&s;ible for the Crown of <HI>Poland</HI> to procure, or pay.</P>
<P>Moreover, his <HI>Electoral Highne&s;&s;e,</HI> perceiving that the State of Affairs in <HI>Denmark,</HI> had changed all the King of <HI>Sweden</HI>'s re&s;olutions, and that he had proceeded to open threats again&s;t the &s;aid <HI>Elector;</HI> he found him&s;elf obliged, to his great grief, to prepare again&s;t his violence, while&s;t he u&s;ed all the po&s;&s;ible
<PB N="5" REF="4">and imaginable good Offices toward the advancing and pro|moting of the Peace between the two Crowns: And the po|&s;ture into which the &s;aid <HI>Elector</HI> hath put him&s;elf, as well by tho&s;e Alliances which he hath made with his Neighbouring Princes, as by the care which he hath taken to pre&s;erve his Army, and to put his places in defence, did not at all hinder him, to apply his thoughts to devi&s;e a meanes to beget a Peace between <HI>Poland</HI> and <HI>Sweden;</HI> with a re&s;olution however, That in ca&s;e he met with too great difficulties therein, at lea&s;t to hinder the Swedi&s;h Forces from marching through the Territories of the Empire, and getting that way into <HI>Poland,</HI> thereby to prevent the ruine of the <HI>&V;pper-Saxony Cerele;</HI> and tho&s;e iconveniencies which the Swedes would cau&s;e him to &s;uffer, to the prejudice of their verball a&s;&s;urances of the con|trary, given at the A&s;&s;embly at <HI>Leip&s;ig,</HI> and at the Dyet at <HI>Franckford,</HI> of their good and reall intentions: And ilke man|ner, by this meanes, to <HI>endeavour to &s;ave and pre&s;erve all</HI> Germany <HI>from the deva&s;tations by Fire and Sword, wherewithall the King of</HI> Sweden <HI>had threatned it.</HI></P>
<P>Whereupon, his <HI>Electoral Highne&s;&s;e,</HI> by his Letters of the 10th of <HI>March</HI> of this pre&s;ent year (annexed and marked,
<NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg">Proof 1.</NOTE>) re|que&s;ted his &s;aid Maje&s;tty to evidence his good intentions to|wards the Peace with <HI>Poland,</HI> and to let him &s;ee the effects of the Promi&s;e which he made unto him thereon; the &s;aid King an&s;wered him on the 10th of <HI>April</HI> next en&s;uing (annexed
<NOTE N="b" PLACE="marg">Proof 2.</NOTE>) and told him, That he had long &s;ince named his Com|mi&s;&s;ioners for the &s;aid Treaty of Peace, but that the <HI>Polander</HI> witne&s;&s;ed &s;o &s;mall an inclination thereunto; as that he dur&s;t not any longer promi&s;e him&s;elf any &s;uch thing.</P>
<P>Moreover, the <HI>Earl</HI> of <HI>Slippenbach,</HI> having at the &s;ame time invited the <HI>Baron</HI> of <HI>Suerin</HI> (his Electoral Highne&s;&s;e of <HI>Brandenburghs,</HI> chief Mini&s;ter of State) to give him a meeting at <HI>Prent&s;lou,</HI> in the <HI>Marck of Brandenburgh;</HI> he there &s;hewed him a <HI>project or draft of an alliance which the King of</HI> Sweden, <HI>pre|tended he would make with the King of</HI> Denmark, <HI>and with &s;ome other Princes and States of Europe;</HI> and pre&s;&s;ed him, on the be|half of the King his Ma&s;ter, to move his <HI>Electoral Highne&s;&s;e</HI> to &s;end his Amba&s;&s;adours thereon, unto his Maje&s;ty, and the &s;aid
<PB N="6" REF="5">Count, continuing his earne&s;t pre&s;&s;ing of the &s;ame, by his Letters of the fir&s;t of <HI>May</HI> (annexed and marked
<NOTE N="c" PLACE="marg">Proof 3.</NOTE>) his &s;aid <HI>E|lectoral Highne&s;&s;e,</HI> who was the rather induced to incline unto a Peace, by how much he knew that the pre&s;ervation of his own E&s;tates and Territories did partly depend thereon; gave ear unto the coun&s;el which was given him by the publick Mini|&s;ters of <HI>France,</HI> &amp; <HI>England,</HI> and al&s;o by his Neighbouring Prin|ces; by his neare&s;t Allyes and Kindred, the <HI>Dukes</HI> of <HI>Brun&s;|wick,</HI> and <HI>Lunenburgh,</HI> and the <HI>Landtgrave</HI> of <HI>He&s;&s;e;</HI> and no|minated for this <HI>Emba&s;&s;y, the Baron of Suerin,</HI> and the Ho|nourable Mr. <HI>Weyman,</HI> one of his <HI>Privy Coun&s;ellors of State:</HI> which Amba&s;&s;adours departed from <HI>Berlin</HI> on the 13th day of the Moneth of <HI>May</HI> la&s;t pa&s;t, and being arrived at <HI>Kiel,</HI> they were very well received in that place, <HI>the Prince of</HI> Sulsbach, <HI>and the Earl of</HI> Slippenbach, coming thither to complement them on the behalf of the <HI>King,</HI> treated them, end entertain|ed them with a great deal of civility; and in that place, they heard the King was at <HI>Flensbourg:</HI> So that being arrived at <HI>Gottorp</HI> (where they had order to <HI>negotiate</HI> &s;everal things with <HI>that Duke,</HI> being a <HI>Prince of the Empire</HI>) they gave notice there|of to the King, who having &s;ent them word by the <HI>Count Pa|latin of Sultsbach,</HI> That it was his de&s;ire they &s;hould come to <HI>Flensbourg.</HI> they immediately repaired thither.</P>
<P>At their arrival, they were lodged by the Kings order, and as &s;oon as they had &s;ent their Letters of Credence unto the Court, a Per&s;on of quality came to complement them on the Kings behalf; which good beginnings, cau&s;ed as great joy in all tho&s;e who de&s;ired pa&s;&s;ionately the &s;etling of a Peace, as the Amba&s;&s;adours them&s;elves, who flattered them&s;elves, but with over-&s;lender hopes, which vani&s;hed in a moment after: <HI>They demanded audience, but they were put off, and delayed by &s;everal pretentions, while&s;t divers per&s;ons were imployed to penetrate into the &s;ecret of their In&s;tructions. And the</HI> Swedes <HI>would needs know, whether they were ordered to mention a Peace with</HI> Poland, <HI>and the re&s;titution of</HI> Pru&s;&s;ia; <HI>and they were given to under&s;tand, That it being unlikely his Majesty could not hear &s;uch Propo&s;itions with|out being di&s;plea&s;ed, might make a difficulty to give them audience, which they demanded, becau&s;e it would tend only to exasperate the
<PB N="7" REF="5">mindes of both Parties. But that in ca&s;e the &s;aid Amba&s;&s;adours had the lea&s;t power to treat on a particular agreement, and to renew the former Amity between his Maje&s;ty and his Electoral Highne&s;s, To renounce and forego, the alliance which he had made with</HI> Poland <HI>and the other Confederates, and to promi&s;e that his &s;aid Highne&s;s would joyn his Forces to the Swedes, thereby to con&s;train their common Enemies to make a Peace, as then his Maje&s;ty would receive the &s;aid Amba&s;&s;adours, and hear them with joy.</HI></P>
<P>Which unacu&s;tomed and irregular way of proceeding, did &s;o much &s;urprize the &s;aid Amba&s;&s;adours, as that they could not choo&s;e but complain thereof; and did declare, That they could not be admitted unto audience, becau&s;e it was known that they had, order to motion a Peace, as if that Sacred and Pious name of <HI>Peace,</HI> ought to have been accounted as an abomination, and ad horror; and mu&s;t needs render tho&s;e odious, who interpo&s;ed therein. However, they profe&s;&s;ed that there &s;hould not be any thing in their Propo&s;als which might di&s;plea&s;e the King, but that they de&s;ired to be excu&s;ed, if before their being admitted to audience, they di&s;covered not their Emba&s;&s;y any further: Notwith&s;tanding, in&s;tead of advancing their audience, they &s;oon di&s;covered that the &s;aid Emba&s;&s;y was not acceptable; and that the King of <HI>Swe|den,</HI> becau&s;e he could not expect or hope to engage his <HI>E|lectoral Highne&s;&s;e</HI> in a particular Treaty; made u&s;e of all the meanes he po&s;&s;ibly could, to &s;ave him&s;elf from the reproach which might be ca&s;t upon him; That he would not give ear to the Propo&s;als of a Peace.</P>
<P>So likewi&s;e, they only endeavoured to prolong the bu&s;i|ne&s;&s;e, and to elude the good intentions of his <HI>Electoral High|ne&s;s,</HI> and publiquely began to laugh at, and deride the &s;aid Em|ba&s;&s;y, begetting daily new difficulties, and alledging that it would be requi&s;ite to <HI>nominate Commi&s;&s;ioners,</HI> who &s;hould en|ter upon a conference with his <HI>Electoral Highne&s;s Amba&s;&s;adours,</HI> in the pre&s;ence of the <HI>Duke</HI> of <HI>Lunenbourg</HI> and <HI>He&s;&s;es</HI> Amba&s;|&s;adours, before they were admitted to an audience by the King; To propound unto them, and to know &s;everal things of them, before which, they could not enter upon any Treaty with them; which was only done a purpo&s;e, indirectly to
<PB N="8" REF="6">di&s;mi&s;&s;e the &s;aid Amba&s;&s;adours, by &s;o unju&s;t a Propo&s;al; or in ca&s;e they &s;hould have been &s;o weak as to have conde&s;cend|ed to &s;uch a Conference, of that nature, and to have acknow|ledged &s;o unlawfull a power; To have obtained tho&s;e ad|vantages thereby, which they might have hoped from tho&s;e Tales and Stories which they would have divulged throughout the whole world, to the prejudice of the repu|tation and intere&s;t of his Electoral Highne&s;&s;e.</P>
<P>And the <HI>Swedes</HI> did apparently the rather de&s;ire the In|tervention of the <HI>Lunenbourg</HI> and <HI>He&s;&s;ian Amba&s;&s;adours,</HI> at this pretended conference, that they might thence gain this ad|vantage to <HI>embroile</HI> his <HI>Electoral Highne&s;&s;e,</HI> with tho&s;e &s;aid Princes; in ca&s;e their Deputies and Commi&s;&s;ioners &s;hould not be &s;atisfied with the &s;aid Amba&s;&s;adours proceedings, or that they them&s;elves might take a pretence and occa&s;ion to break with them, in ca&s;e their Te&s;timonies &s;hould condemn the King of <HI>Sweden</HI>'s Proceedings. The Lords <HI>Mevius, Kley</HI> and <HI>Eren&s;tein,</HI> who were nominated Commi&s;&s;ioners in the be|half of the King of <HI>Sweden;</HI> for the &s;aid conference, accor|dingly &s;ignified the Kings re&s;olution unto the &s;aid Amba&s;&s;a|dours, on the 22th of <HI>June.</HI></P>
<P>Whereunto the &s;aid Amba&s;&s;adours made An&s;wer, and alledged, That they were very much &s;urprized at the advice they had received, not believing that in the pre&s;ent conjun|cture of affairs; when as they might have hoped and pro|mi&s;ed them&s;elves an audience from the King, &s;uch a Propo|&s;ition could be made unto them: wherefore they de&s;ired time to re&s;olve upon a definitive An&s;wer thereon, and the which they would &s;end to the Lord <HI>Mevius.</HI> But before they took their &s;aid Re&s;olution what to an&s;wer, they vi&s;ited the <HI>Lu|nenbourg</HI> and <HI>He&s;&s;ian Amba&s;&s;adours,</HI> who were as much &s;ur|prized as them&s;elves, and could not imagine nor compre|hend, why the <HI>Swedes</HI> would oblige them to be pre&s;ent at a conference, <HI>at which they neither would nor could intervene,</HI> either as <HI>Judges, Parties,</HI> or <HI>Witne&s;&s;es.</HI></P>
<P>In&s;omuch that the &s;aid Amba&s;&s;adours &s;ent back word in writing, to the Lord <HI>Mevius</HI> (marked and annexed

<P>The &s;aid Commi&s;&s;ioners made an&s;wer to the foregoing Note, in &s;omewhat brisk termes (annexed and marked

<P>True it is, that one of the Kings Trompeters was imme|diately &s;ent after the Amba&s;&s;adours, who overtook them at <HI>Rensbough,</HI> where he delivered them a Letter (annexed and marked

<P>YOur Letters of the 10th of <HI>March,</HI> were &s;afely delivered to me, and I do thereby perceive, not only the pa&s;&s;ion which you bear towards the advancement of the Peace of <HI>Po|land,</HI> but that you do a&s;&s;ure me, I &s;hall meet with the &s;ame affection and &s;incerity in the King of <HI>Poland</HI>'s intentions; but likewi&s;e &s;ee the paines you do promi&s;e, to take in the promoting of &s;o godly a work, and the Amity and Friend|&s;hip, which you tell me, you will con&s;tantly pre&s;erve for my Per&s;on and my Crown: wherefore I would not omit to an|&s;wer the &s;aid Letter, and to tell you, as your good Friend and Cou&s;en, That you do know I have long &s;ince nominated Commi&s;&s;ioners to treat on the Peace of <HI>Poland;</HI> and that I have given them &s;ufficient in&s;tructions, and full power, as well before, as &s;ince the Conclu&s;ion of the Treaty with the King of <HI>Denmark,</HI> and expre&s;s Orders, ince&s;&s;antly to labour in the promoting of &s;o good a work: In&s;omuch, that it is neither mine nor my Mini&s;ters faults (who were alwaies ready to proceed, being &s;ufficiently impowered) that the Peace of <HI>Poland,</HI> and of its Allyes, hath not long &s;ince been concluded: But the in&s;olent and arrogant an&s;wers which the <HI>Polanders</HI> returned to the Amba&s;&s;adour <HI>de Lombres,</HI> touching
<PB N="14" REF="9">the &s;aid Pacification, hath given me cau&s;e to believe, That they harbour a quite contrary de&s;ign, then to make a Peace.

Wherefore you may with more rea&s;on, make your applications to the King of <HI>Poland,</HI> and repre&s;ent unto him, <HI>as you do very wi&s;ely alledge it in the &s;aid Letter;</HI> How much it doth concern you, that the &s;aid <HI>Peace be forthwith concluded.</HI> Be&s;ides which, you may remain a&s;&s;ured, That I have with &s;o much the more joy, &s;een the Prote&s;tation which you do make of the continuance of your friend&s;hip to|wards my Per&s;on and Crown; as that lately it was reported to the contrary: And that they would needs make me be|lieve, That you had harboured, and taken re&s;olutions very prejudicial to the good of my Affairs. However, I alwaies conceived, That being convinced in your con&s;cience of the &s;incerity of my intentions, and that being fully per&s;waded of the affection which I bear towards the pre&s;ervation of your Per&s;on, and of your E&s;tates, you could not po&s;&s;ibly be ren|dred capable to give ear to tho&s;e things which might be told you, nor believe tho&s;e things which might be averred unto you to the contrary; farre le&s;s, to change that Friend&s;hip whereof you have &s;o often given me &s;uch great a&s;&s;urances: But that you would have a great deal of rea&s;on to imploy all kind of meanes, to the end, that <HI>by Propo&s;als of a rea&s;onable and advantagious Peace,</HI> I may be delivered from &s;o great a number of Enemies, as do on all &s;ides declare them&s;elves

You do know, that I have &s;everal times in writing, a&s;&s;ured you of the con&s;tancy of my friend&s;hip; which makes me beleeve, that on your part, you will retain the &s;ame inclination to cultivate it, and to relinqui&s;h tho&s;e things which may either alter or de&s;troy the &s;ame: Finally, I do not doubt but that the Almighty will continue to ble&s;s my de|&s;igns, will confound the coun&s;els of my enemies, and will di&s;po&s;e the hearts of my neighbours to Peace, and to a rea&s;on|able agreement.

Wherefore his Ma|je&s;ty will ot hearken to any Propo&s;als, &s;ave &s;uch as may conduce to a particular Peace, and may advance the reestabli&s;hing of the friend|&s;hip betwixt his Maje&s;ty and his Electorall Highne&s;s; becau&s;e the Peace of <HI>Poland</HI> mu&s;t be negotiated by Mediators, and not by &s;uch as have taken party, and declared them&s;elves: You know how I have alwayes a&s;&s;ured you, That notwith&s;tanding all what is pa&s;t, his Ma|je&s;ty would be glad to &s;ee you, in ca&s;e you came accompanied with power to cement the former Friend&s;hip, and to quit the alliance of his Enemies: But &s;eeing in lieu of coming hither upon that account, we know, that &s;ince your departure from <HI>Berlin,</HI> the enterchangeably delivery of the Treaty, made with the hou&s;e of <HI>Au&s;tria</HI> hath been per|formed: That the Gunpowder, which his Maje&s;ty &s;ent into <HI>Pru&s;&s;ia,</HI> hath been &s;topt at the <HI>Pilliw:</HI> That a Garri&s;on hath been put into <HI>Frawenburg;</HI> and that &s;ince all other things have been done, whereon his Maje&s;ty hath rea&s;on to be ill &s;atisfied; he will determinately know, what he is to trust to from the Elector: Whereunto his Maje&s;ty doth add, That in ca&s;e you will yet &s;end for a Power, to confer upon a particular Treaty, he will nominate Commi&s;sioners and Deputies on his behalf, who &s;hall meet in any neutrall place, &s;uch a one as &s;hall be agreed upon: but that otherwi&s;e he is fully re&s;olved, not to admit you to an audience; nor to receive any thing on the behalf of a Prince who is entred into an alliance with his Enemies. I am grieved to the heart, when I do reflect upon the pre&s;ent conjuncture of affairs, and when I con&s;ider that labyrinthe, wherein his Electorall Highne&s;s hath engaged him&s;elf, by the conference at <HI>Bromberg,</HI> and by the a&s;&s;embly of &s;o many Amba&s;&s;adours, as were lately at <HI>Berlin;</HI> God

<HEAD>The Propo&s;ition which was &s;ent in writing by the Swedi&s;h Commi&s;&s;i|oners after the <HI>Brandenbourg</HI> Amba&s;&s;adours.</HEAD>
<P>IT is mo&s;t a&s;&s;ured, that the Law of Nature, and the Cu&s;tomes ad|mitted by all people, do permit a Sovereign to receive and Treat Amba&s;&s;adours, according to the quality and de&s;erts of tho&s;e Princes, by whom they are &s;ent, and according to the nature of the bui&s;ne&s;s whereon they are to Treat; wherefore his Maje&s;ty believes, that it cannot be ill taken, if by vertue of that liberty, which is as free to him as to all other Kings, he doth con&s;titute Commi&s;&s;ioners, and cau&s;eth a Propo&s;ition to be made to the <HI>Brandenbourg</HI> Amba&s;&s;a|dours: The which he deemed the more requi&s;ite to be done, by rea&s;on that the Prince their Ma&s;ter, hath made it appear, that he will not be his friend. For although that his &s;erene Electoral Highne&s;s did
<PB N="23" REF="13">de&s;ire and &s;eek for the alliance with his Maje&s;ty, from the very time that deliberations were as yet but on foot in <HI>Sweden;</HI> whether or no the Poli&s;h War &s;hould be undertaken: and that his &s;aid High|ne&s;&s;e, did not only encourage his Maje&s;ty to this enterprize, but al&s;o promi&s;ed by a formall Treaty, his A&s;i&s;tances and Forces again&s;t <HI>Poland:</HI> However, all the world doth know, That he hath renoun|ced the &s;aid alliance with his Maje&s;ty: It was to have been perpe|tual, and undi&s;&s;olvable, but his Electoral Highne&s;&s;e rent it a&s;under without any nece&s;&s;ity, which might not, at lea&s;t, have been di|spene't withall, &s;ince he might have avoided the &s;ame, by doing or by &s;uffering that to be done, which would have been very feazible; and not at all regarding the particular favour which his Maje&s;ty did him, to offer him a neutrallity upon &s;uch rea&s;onable conditions, as would not have been prejudicial to his Maje&s;ties affairs: And as if it were a &s;mall matter to contract to friend&s;hip with a declared ene|my of his fir&s;t Allyes, his Electoral Highne&s;s cea&s;ed not therewith neither, but pa&s;&s;ed on further, and hath made a League, in which the King is treated, and &s;tiled, the common enemy. He promi&s;eth his favour and a&s;&s;i&s;tance to the Kings declared enemies, not only in <HI>Pru&s;&s;ia,</HI> but al&s;o in the Empire; and be&s;peaks his &s;hare of tho&s;e Conque&s;ts which are pretended to be made in tho&s;e States which his Maje&s;ty did and doth there po&s;&s;e&s;&s;e, contrary to the expre&s;s promi&s;e which he had made to his Maje&s;ty, to be a&s;&s;i&s;ting unto him in the defence thereof, with all his might, again&s;t all Parties what&s;oever; which appears manife&s;tly by the Articles of the Treaty which was Negotiated and at <HI>Velau,</HI> and finally concluded and &s;igned at <HI>Brom|berg.</HI></P>
<P>His <HI>Electoral Highne&s;s,</HI> after he had held private intelligence with the King of <HI>Denmark,</HI> entred upon a Negotiation with him, during the &s;ame time when as the King had declared War again&s;t him, and while&s;t his Armies were in tho&s;e Kingdomes; he exhort|ed the King of <HI>Denmark,</HI> to continue the War, and to reject Peace; not contenting him&s;elf to encourage him herein, but al&s;o promi&s;ing him a speedy relief, and to make a powerfull diver&s;ion in tho&s;e Pro|vinces where his Maje&s;ty had his Armies: All which Treaty was carried on at <HI>Coppenhagen</HI> by the &s;ame Amba&s;&s;adour, who had proferred his Princes Mediation to procure a Peace between <HI>Sweden</HI> and <HI>Denmark;</HI> although &s;ince, it was continued by another, and
<PB N="25" REF="14">finally concluded at <HI>Cologne</HI> on the <HI>Spre&eacute;.</HI></P>
<P>But to compa&s;s this promi&s;ed relief, a more powerfull e&s;tabli&s;h|ment was requi&s;ite, wherefore a Negotiation was commenced with the mo&s;t &s;erene King of <HI>Hungary</HI> for an alliance; which at fir&s;t was only to have been defen&s;ive, but afterwards came to an offen&s;ive one, which was speedily concluded and compleated with &s;o much animo|&s;ity, as that not only his Maje&s;ty was therein treated as the common enemy of <HI>Chri&s;tendome,</HI> but al&s;o the Treaty was filled with all that po&s;&s;ibly could be alledged again&s;t the greate&s;t Enemies tho&s;e Al|lyes had; and it was re&s;olved, not only to &s;et upon tho&s;e places which his Maje&s;ty had in <HI>Poland,</HI> but al&s;o to take and &s;hare among&s;t the &s;aid Allyes, tho&s;e Provinces which do belong unto him in the Empire.</P>
<P>Nor did his Electoral Highne&s;&s;e remain &s;atisfied, to permit the&s;e particulars to be &s;et down in writing, but did al&s;o pa&s;s on to commit acts of ho&s;tility, as followeth: He gave pa&s;&s;age and Provi&s;ions to the <HI>Polanders,</HI> and &s;uffered them to over-run, pillage, and burn <HI>Pomerania;</HI> he hindered tho&s;e Leagues which his Maje&s;ty cau&s;ed to be made in the Empire, although the &s;ame are permitted unto all Princes indifferently, &s;eeing they were not burden&s;ome to any one; and that they were only to be imployed in the defence of his Territories: He commanded his Subjects to quit his Maje&s;ties &s;ervice, again&s;t the Liberties which the Lawes of the Empire give them: he cau&s;ed to be &s;topt in the Haven of <HI>Pillou,</HI> tho&s;e Powders and other Muni|tions of War, and Provi&s;ions which the King had &s;ent to his Places in <HI>Pru&s;&s;ia,</HI> contrary to the Treaty of alliance, and again&s;t the Law of Nations; and he oppo&s;ed him&s;elf in the A&s;&s;embly of the Lower <HI>Circle</HI> of <HI>Saxony,</HI> unto that &s;ecurity which the E&s;tates of that <HI>Circle</HI> were obliged to give him again&s;t the inva&s;ion of the King of <HI>Denmark;</HI> crying down his Maje&s;ties actions, and te&s;tifying his hatred and malice, by animating and &s;tirring up all the world a|gain&s;t him, as again&s;t the common enemy; at &s;uch a time when as his Electoral Highne&s;s had not any occa&s;ion to complain of his &s;aid Maje&s;ty, but when the King did give him the greate&s;t proof of his Friend&s;hip and good will.</P>
<P>All men do know, and it is mo&s;t a&s;&s;ured, that his Electoral Highne&s;&s;e hath promi&s;ed the King of <HI>Denmark</HI> relief, that he hath &s;ollicited the conjunction of the <HI>Au&s;trian</HI> Armies; and that to this end, the Forces of the Allies did often &s;hew them&s;elves in <HI>Ger|many,</HI>
<PB N="24" REF="14">when as there did not any enemy at all appear, and when as there was not any thing at all to be apprehended: That he hath de|&s;ired a&s;i&s;tance from all parts, as again&s;t a declared enemy; and that he had endeavoured to render the Kings be&s;t actions odious: In&s;o|much, as it is void of all doubt, but that he would ab&s;olutely have declared him&s;elf, had it not been for the Ju&s;tice and Pro&s;perity of his Maje&s;ties Armies.</P>
<P>And although the&s;e undeniable Proofs (which have been but too much confirmed by the publick report of them) did manife&s;t his Electoral Highne&s;s ill intentions, yet his Maje&s;ty never changed his good will, which he ever bore towards one who threatned him, although he lea&s;t de&s;erved it; having declared while&s;t he was yet at <HI>Gottenbourg,</HI> that in ca&s;e his Electoral Highne&s;&s;e would depute any of his Mini&s;ters towards him, accompanied with &s;ufficient Power to cement and &s;ettle the former Friend&s;hip again, his Maje&s;ty would alwaies be found willing to embrace the &s;ame.</P>
<P>But his Electoral Highne&s;s was &s;o farre from an&s;wering the&s;e Te&s;timonies of Friend&s;hip, that, notwith&s;tanding the foregoing Declarations; and as &s;oon as his Amba&s;&s;adours were departed <HI>Ber|lin,</HI> he did ratifie that Treaty which was made with the mo&s;t &s;erene King of <HI>Hungary,</HI> again&s;t his Maje&s;ty, as again&s;t a common enemy; did again cau&s;e to be arre&s;ted in the <HI>Pillau,</HI> tho&s;e Powders and Amunitions which were &s;ent to the Royal <HI>Pru&s;&s;ia,</HI> and did put a Garri&s;on in <HI>Frawenberg,</HI> which the <HI>Au&s;trians</HI> had abandoned, although he had no title to the &s;ame; and that according to the Trea|ties between the King and the Elector, and according to the Mili|tary Lawes, that place ought to have remained in the Kings po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion: however, he refu&s;ed to admit the <HI>Swedi&s;h</HI> Troops into the &s;ame, cau&s;ed the Officers to be pur&s;ued, filled the A&s;&s;emblies with com|plaints; without cau&s;e of Ju&s;tice, &s;ent to demand aide from all Parts, as again&s;t a declared enemy; and did all he could, to manife&s;t his di&s;affection and ill will, and the &s;mall inclination he bore to the Peace.</P>
<P>In&s;omuch, as that the King finding him&s;elf obliged to a&s;&s;ure him|&s;elf of his Electoral Higne&s;s intentions, and to know whether he was to Treat with the Amba&s;&s;adours of a Prince, in Peace, or at enmity; (&s;ince by what we have before alledged, it could not otherwi&s;e
<PB N="26" REF="15">be conceived;) he thought, that by vertue of the Law of Nations, and the Cu&s;tomes admitted by all Kings and people, to name Com|mi&s;&s;ioners, who might Penetrate into the Princes intentions, who might know the &s;ubject of the Emba&s;sy; and who might &s;ee the Am|ba&s;&s;adours power, before he re&s;olved (during this uncertainty) whether he &s;hould admit them or no. True it is, that his Maje&s;ty permitted the Amba&s;&s;adours to come to this Town, but not with an in|tent thereby to tye up his own hands, and to forego that freedom which he hath, to cau&s;e the nece&s;&s;ary Precautions to take place. To the con|trary, without their coming hither, how could we have learn't of them tho&s;e things which we de&s;ired to know? And we could not have told how to have regulated tho&s;e things which were requi&s;ite, before we proceeded to a Negotiation; to the end, we might judge by the nature of tho&s;e affairs, wherewith they were intru&s;ted, in what manner we &s;hould Treat them: and thereon, to re&s;olve, whether or no, in the audience which &s;hould afterwards be granted unto them, they &s;hould be con&s;i|dered either as Friends or Enemies: As al&s;o, to re&s;olve, whether the Dignity of the King, and the Pre&s;ent &s;tate of affairs, would per|mit to receive them at all.</P>
<P>And fora&s;much as the Amba&s;&s;adours of <HI>Brunswick, Lunen|berg,</HI> and of <HI>He&s;&s;e,</HI> were come in the behalf of their Superiours, to proffer their Mediations, it was thought good to invite tdem to be pre&s;ent at the Conference; to the end, they might be Witne&s;&s;es of the Ju&s;tice, Sincerity, and Integrity, whereon we &s;hould have proceeded on his Maje&s;ties behalf: We cannon imagine why the Electors Am|ba&s;&s;adours would not conde&s;cend thereunto. They alledge indeed, that it is a thing without a Pre&s;ident, contrary to the u&s;uall Formes and Cu&s;tomes, and prejudicial to the Dignity of his Electoral High|ne&s;&s;e. But as the Execution of a thing which is ju&s;t and rea|&s;onable in its &s;elf, ought not to be hindered, becau&s;e no example can be alledged thereof: &s;o likewi&s;e ought it to have been con|&s;idered, that in all this, there is nothing contrary, to what Princes are accu&s;tomed to do, by profferring their Mediation and good Offices unto two Parties; and that there is nothing in it, which doth repugne the equity or dignity of his Electoral Highne&s;s, &s;ince the King hath done all, what in rea&s;on could be de&s;ired of him, with|out the prejudicing of his Intere&s;ts.</P>
<P>But the refu&s;all which the Amba&s;&s;adours made, to enter into a
<PB N="27" REF="15">Conference, in the pre&s;ence of a third Party, doth render their Em|ba&s;&s;y to be &s;u&s;pected; and the rather, when the Amba&s;&s;adours of <HI>Lunenburg</HI> having de&s;ired to be excu&s;ed (becau&s;e they fore&s;aw the Amba&s;&s;adours of <HI>Brandenbourg,</HI> would not give way thereunto) the King would willingly have &s;o much complyance for both Par|ties, as to exempt them, that &s;o no retardment might en&s;ue upon the Treaty.</P>
<P>Now the chief Point of this our Propo&s;ition, is, That his Ma|je&s;ty having deemed it fit, before all things, to know the intention of his &s;erene Elector&s;hip, hath commanded us to ask you, whe|ther his &s;aid Electoral Highne&s;s, will di&s;ingage him&s;elf from the Intere&s;ts of his Maje&s;ties Enemies, and renew the Treaties of Peace and Friend&s;hip, which &s;eem to be changed, by tho&s;e things which we have before alledged; as al&s;o: to know what power you have to proceed hereon: So &s;oon as his Maje&s;ty &s;hall be a&s;&s;ured of the one, and &s;hall know that you have &s;ufficient power for the other, he will immediately give command for the beginning of the Treaties; and in ca&s;e you have not &s;ufficient Power, his Maje&s;ty permits you to &s;tay in this Town, untill &s;uch time as you have received them: Or otherwi&s;e, doth con|&s;ent that the Treaties may be held in any other Newtrall place; as at <HI>Kiel, Sle&s;wick,</HI> or <HI>Hambourg:</HI> And as &s;oon as his Ma|je&s;ty &s;hall have notice thereof, he will nominate Commi&s;&s;ioners, and will ordain what el&s;e &s;hall be requi&s;ite to cau&s;e the Treaty to take effect. This is that which we have thought good to repre|&s;ent unto you, and al&s;o to a&s;&s;ure you of our humble &s;ervices, &s;o farre as they &s;hall not be repugnant to that Duty which we owe unto our King.</P>

<P>VVE received tho&s;e Letters which you wrote unto us from <HI>Flensbourg,</HI> on the 24 <HI>June,</HI> and to tell you the truth, we are in a manner a&s;toni&s;hed, that you &s;hould &s;end after us, and that we are accu&s;ed to have precipitated our departure; and that likewi&s;e the fault of all that which hath hapned is ca&s;t upon us: We were &s;ent, if not at the reque&s;t, yet at lea&s;t not again&s;t the de&s;ire of his Maje&s;ty, by a Prince Elector of the Empire, who is his Kin&s;man and Neighbour: we were at our arrivall received by his Maje&s;ties Mini&s;ters, and at their reque&s;t, we drew nigh, as we may &s;ay, even to the gates of his Court, and, if after our &s;o long &s;ojourning there, (as that we could not any longer have &s;tayed, without our detracting from the grandure and dignity of his Electorall Highne&s;s) we at length departed thence: You may con&s;ider if you plea&s;e, that it was a meer con&s;traint; and after tho&s;e unque|&s;tionable proofs which we had received of the de&s;ign there was to have treated his Electorall Highne&s;s as a declared Ene|my; which was evident, not only by the generall report there|of which was come to our ears, but al&s;o by the Expre&s;s Letters from the Lord of <HI>Slippenbach,</HI> which you will find hereunto an|nexed; for which we were very &s;orry. And tho&s;e Letters which we have written unto the &s;aid Count upon this &s;ubject, in an&s;wer unto his, do &s;ufficiently denote the &s;ame: but by rea&s;on they were delivered late enough, and that we a&s;&s;ured|ly beleeve you have not &s;een them, we do think fitting to add thus much, That we &s;hall alwayes mo&s;t powerfully &s;econd the great inclinations which his Electorall Highne&s;s harbour|eth towards a Peace, and towards an accommodation; we &s;hall expect his Orders thereon at <HI>Hamborow;</HI> and as &s;oon as we &s;hall have received them, we will not fail to give you no|tice

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIRS:</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>BEfore we left <HI>Rensbourg,</HI> we returned you an An&s;wer to the Letter you wrote unto us from <HI>Flensbourg;</HI> but being on our jouaney, and ready to take Coach, we contented our &s;elves only to write the more &s;uccinctly unto you, by how much we are per&s;waded of the high prudence of the King your Ma&s;ter, and therefore do firmly beleeve, that he cannot de&s;ire more at our hands, &s;ince it mu&s;t needs be evident, that being at &s;o great a di&s;tance from our Court, it was not in our powers to return unto the place from whence we came, but much again&s;t our wills; and far le&s;s to engage the intere&s;t and dig|nity of the Prince our Ma&s;ter, in writing, without his Electorall Highne&s;s expre&s;s order. Wherefore we were re&s;olved without any delay, to have repre&s;ented the whole unto him by our Letters; to the end that having received his commands thereon, we might the better have made an&s;wer from <HI>Hamborow,</HI> to tho&s;e things which you de&s;ire to know of us.</P>
<P>We do not deny but that the bui&s;ne&s;s is of &s;o great importance, as that all things ought to have been e&s;&s;ayed rather then to break, and by a precipitated re&s;olution, to have fru&s;trated the effects of our Emba&s;|&s;ie, from which all Chri&s;tendome might ju&s;tly expect &s;o con&s;iderable an advantage: We &s;till do beleeve the &s;ame, and therefore we &s;hall u&s;e all po&s;sible means to ju&s;tifie our proceedings; and to let the world &s;ee, That if the &s;ucce&s;s proves not an&s;werable to our de&s;ires, we &s;hall at lea&s;t have &s;atisfied our con&s;ciences, by the integrity of our Councils, and the &s;incerity of our Intentions.</P>
<P>But we think our &s;elves obliged to give you notice, That having more maturely con&s;idered on what behoved us to do; we have thought it fitting to change the re&s;olution which we had taken, to expect his Electorall Highne&s;s command in this place, conceiving it to be more
<PB N="30" REF="17">expedient that we go to <HI>Berlin</HI> with all speed; becau&s;e a per&s;onall negotiation hath &s;omething more in it then can be expected to be ef|fected by writing, and at lea&s;t we &s;hall reap this &s;atisfaction by our voyage, that by a speedy and faithfull report of all the bui&s;ne&s;s, we &s;hall bring it to a re&s;olve without any delay; we doubt not but you will be of the &s;ame minde, and that con&s;equently you will take pa|tience, and expect &s;uch an&s;wers as we &s;hall return unto you, &s;o &s;oon as we &s;hall be arrived at our Court.</P>
<P>And as to what concerns the bu&s;ine&s;s it &s;elf, we have &s;een and ex|amined the writing which you &s;ent us, together with the Letters; and we hope you have &s;o good an opinion of us, as to beleeve that we are not altogether &s;o ignorant in the debating of affairs, nor &s;o much void of rea&s;on, but that it would be very ea&s;ie for us to make an&s;wer to the chief heads of the &s;aid Manife&s;t; and clearly to demon&s;trate, That it is full of Equivocations, of words who&s;e &s;en&s;e and meaning are ob&s;cure, and containeth &s;everall things which are as much di&s;&s;o|nant unto the Piety of our Prince, as from Truth it &s;elf: whereof we are &s;o well a&s;&s;ured in our con&s;ciences, as that we are willing to beleeve, That the &s;aid Peece was not &s;ent unto us from the King, nor were tho&s;e Writings compiled out of the Regi&s;ters of tho&s;e Per&s;ons, who had an inspection in bui&s;ne&s;s; but by &s;uch as were transported by an unfor|tunate precipitation, or by a fal&s;e and &s;ad preoccupation, without any knowledg at, all of the foregoing pa&s;&s;ages; nor reflecting in the lea&s;t upon tho&s;e things which are to en&s;ue; not being &s;o di&s;creet as to con&s;ider what they did, and were wilfully re&s;olved to trouble the Peace of Chri&s;tendome, by new affected quarrels, in &s;tead of &s;etling and ree&s;tabli&s;hing the &s;ame by new and well grounded alliances. But &s;ince the Honour of, and even his Electorall Higne&s;s con&s;cience, art engaged in this concerment, we &s;hall de&s;ire you not to take it ill, that we enter no further thereon at this pre&s;ent, but that we leave the re|&s;entment thereof unto him&s;elf.</P>
<P>There is but one thing which we finde our &s;elves obliged to touch on, by the by, which is that in your writing, you &s;ay the King hath chang|ed his re&s;olution, and that he would have &s;o much complai&s;ance or indulgence (according to the Latin original word, they are your own words) for the Amba&s;&s;adours of <HI>Lunenbourg</HI> and <HI>He&s;&s;e,</HI> as to dispence with them &s;o far, as that they might not entervene at the Meeting or Conference, which he had cau&s;ed to be propounded unto
<PB N="31" REF="17">us: But we crave your pardon, if we averre, that you do maintain with too much a&s;&s;urance, a thing which is not &s;o: For the &s;aid Am|ba&s;&s;adours them&s;elves, and the Kings Ministers, do full well know, as you your &s;elves Sirs (who are Per&s;ons of Honour) can te&s;tifie; that we knew nothing thereof, and that the least word thereon was not told unto us: the la&s;t Letters from the Lord of <HI>Slippenbach,</HI> and the vi&s;its which were made to the &s;aid Amba&s;&s;adours, to take our leaves of them, are manife&s;t Proofs to the contrary; and do plainly evidence, that there was no appearance at all for us, to expect an audience, in &s;uch a manner as was due unto us; nor that the King would alter the re&s;olution, which he he had taken, to make us &s;erve as an example unto Po&s;terity; and to expo&s;e us un|to an unavoidable affront, &s;uch a one, as was not to be repaired, in|&s;tead of treating of us as Amba&s;&s;adours, from a Prince Elector of the Empire.</P>
<P>But we can with more truth alledge, That we never refu&s;ed to admit of the Amba&s;&s;adours of <HI>Lunenbourg</HI> and <HI>He&s;&s;en;</HI> by rea&s;on that the &s;ubject our of Emba&s;&s;y, being ju&s;t and plau&s;ible, we had no rea&s;on at all, to debarre the Mini&s;ters of tho&s;e Princes from the Cogni&s;ance thereof, who profe&s;&s;e a mo&s;t particular friend&s;hip to our Ma&s;ter; neither did we ever hinder the Kings Mini&s;ters from vi&s;iting of us, nor never refu&s;ed to enter into any Conference with them: But we would not, nor could not con&s;ent into a Con|ference, the manner, place, and time whereof was pre&s;cribed us. We believed it was not expedient, but very un&s;ea&s;onable, becau&s;e it was to have preceed our audience; be&s;ides, we had rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect the &s;aid Conference; neither would we acknowledge that &s;uperiori|ty, whereby it was intended to have enforced us thereunto: Or ra|ther, we would not accept of that, which the Amba&s;&s;adours them|&s;elves could not approve of. For we came not thither to debate, or for to enter into a conte&s;tation with the Kings Mini&s;ters, but we were there in the quality of Amba&s;&s;adours, for to demand Audience of the King: We appeared there (I &s;ay) becau&s;e the King had de|&s;ired it, and becau&s;e his Mini&s;ters had invited us thither, had re|ceived us, had entertained us, and had done us &s;everal other Civili|ties: After all which, not to be admitted unto audience, to have the &s;ame deferred and delayed, and finally, ab&s;olutely refu&s;ed; which was never yet done by any Prince, who had once received Amba&s;&s;a|dours
<PB N="32" REF="18">into his Court, &s;ince it is to the Per&s;on of the Prince, and not to his Mini&s;ters, That Amba&s;&s;adours do make their addre&s;&s;es. This was the thing at which we were offended, and this was the cau&s;e why, to our great grief, we departed.</P>
<P>Nor can you alledge, That we precipitated our &s;aid departure, &s;ince it could ea&s;ily be imagined, that after &s;o long a &s;tay, we were not like to beg for an audience, which in Ju&s;tice ought not to have been refu&s;ed us.</P>
<P>But all the&s;e things are &s;o well known unto you, as that we &s;hall not need to adde any thing el&s;e hereunto; being a&s;certained in our Con&s;ciences, that you mu&s;t needs acquie&s;&s;e unto tho&s;e Truths, which we have alledged. Moreover, we remain,</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>Sirs,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>NO Per&s;on what&s;oever, who hath the lea&s;t in&s;ight and knowledge of the &s;tate of our Affairs, can be igno|rant, That the Piety, and the Intere&s;t of our Elector, doth oblige him earne&s;tly to endeavour the generall Peace; and to &s;ee it maintained, and pre&s;erved throughout all <HI>Chri&s;ten|dome.</HI> For all men, who profe&s;s them&s;elves to be ver&s;ed in the managing of publique affairs, mu&s;t needs avouch; That this <HI>Prince, who&s;e Prudence is of as large an extent, as his Provinces,</HI> by intere&s;ting him&s;elf in the e&s;tabli&s;hing of the publique tranquility of the Chri&s;tian world, doth at the &s;ame time, include the &s;etling of his own private &s;ecurity; becau&s;e his Principalities bordering on mo&s;t of the Domini|ons of the Princes of <HI>Germany,</HI> it is unpo&s;&s;ible for him to pre&s;erve them, but by his keeping a perfect good intelligence betwixt his Neighbours.</P>
<P>His <HI>Electoral Highne&s;s</HI> hath &s;o well accompli&s;hed the &s;ame,
<PB N="33" REF="18">as that being unreproachable upon this account, he thought him&s;elf not bound to be offended, when by our relation, he heard the ill Treatment, which we received by your King, and &s;aw the calumnies, wherewith all he finds him&s;elf &s;landered, by that Paper which you &s;ent unto us from <HI>Flensbourgh.</HI></P>
<P>This <HI>great Prince,</HI> is willing to forget and pa&s;s by the par|ticular wrongs; which are done unto his Per&s;on, to bewail poor <HI>Germany,</HI> which is like to be involved in new di&s;orders: However, he cannot choo&s;e but dete&s;t the <HI>Ingratitude</HI> of tho&s;e, <HI>who cloak their pernitious de&s;ignes;</HI> and the rage, by which they endeavour to continue the Warres, by &s;uch un|ju&s;t pretentions.</P>
<P>Our <HI>Prince is rendred guilty,</HI> becau&s;e he hath not quite ruined him&s;elf for your Kings &s;ake; and he is threatned with a Warre, becau&s;e he cannot any longer &s;econd an o|thers <HI>ambition,</HI> without the expo&s;ing of his Per&s;on, and his Dominions, to a finall ruine. And moreover, he is at this pre&s;ent, reproached with that, which the King did former|ly e&s;teem the mo&s;t of all in him; <HI>when he confe&s;&s;ed, that he &s;hould never be able, to acknowledge tho&s;e, Obligations, for the which he &s;tood engaged to his Electoral Highne&s;&s;e:</HI> Ju&s;t as if there were a great deal of advantage to be reaped, by finding out a pretence to ruine a Friend, unto whom a man is over-ob|liged; and a great deal of glory to be taken, in the pillaging of a Creditours Hou&s;e, thereby to find wherewithall to pay a Debt, which would otherwi&s;e reman un&s;olved. They affect to render all the Princes actions odious, without re|flecting on tho&s;e things, which he hath formerly done; and in&s;tead of the di&s;&s;embling, or at lea&s;t, excu&s;ing tho&s;e things, which might be blamed in the conduct of a Friend, &s;o great a plea&s;ure is taken in the crying down of the &s;ame; as it &s;eemes they are glad to have met with &s;omething, where|on they might frame a pretended quarrell again&s;t him.</P>
<P>Neither can it be with any other de&s;ign, that his Electorall Highne&s;s is accu&s;ed, <HI>To have &s;olicited the Warre again&s;t</HI> Poland; <HI>to have quitted the alliance, without any nece&s;&s;ity; to have made a
<PB N="34" REF="19">new one with</HI> Poland, <HI>and with the Hou&s;e of</HI> Au&s;tria; <HI>to have endeavored to engage the King of</HI> Denmark <HI>in the &s;ame; to have promi&s;ed relief to the one, and to have demanded it from the other; to have given pa&s;&s;age to the enemies; to have recalled his Subjects out of the Kings &s;ervice; to have hindred his Leagues; to have &s;eized the Gunpowders:</HI> and to have done &s;everal other things, without the making of any di&s;tinction, either of time of places, with as much affectation as inju&s;tice. It would be a very ea&s;ie matter for us, to reply on all the Accu&s;ations, in &s;uch a manner, as thereby we might manife&s;t the ju&s;tice of our Cau&s;e, and the integrity of our Intentions; if &s;o be our Prince, who is not capable of our unworthine&s;s and low actions, had not rather remit him&s;elf thereon, unto your own Con&s;ciences, then to render you a&s;hamed, by tho&s;e An&s;wers, which he would return to your re|proaches.</P>
<P>However, we cannot choo&s;e but tell you, That there is &s;o much the le&s;s appearance of what you alledge; <HI>That his E|lectorall Highne&s;&s;e &s;hould have &s;ought unto you for your alliance, to make War again&s;t</HI> Poland; as that you cannot tell why he &s;hould have done &s;o? what advantages he could thereby reape? or what glory he &s;hould thereby ac|quire?</P>
<P><HI>Warre,</HI> certainly cannot be plea&s;ing, &s;ave only unto tho&s;e, who are <HI>transported, either by ambition or covetou&s;ne&s;&s;e;</HI> or who through poverty, are con&s;trained to live by Thefts, and Rob|ing of other mens E&s;tates: Unto &s;uch (I &s;ay) as take a delight amid&s;t the publick calamities, and e&s;teem their only tortures to con&s;i&s;t in Peace and Tranquility; who reverence vice, and who account of Pillagings, Murders, Violations, Sacriledges, and the other in&s;eparable di&s;orders, which are tyed to a Warre, as heroick Vertues, and as qualities be|coming a King. But <HI>our Prince,</HI> was alwaies incapable of &s;uch unworthy thoughts: <HI>For he &s;ucked Piety from his Mothers Brea&s;ts, and he inherited the love of Ju&s;tice, and the fear of God, from his Predece&s;&s;ors.</HI></P>
<P>We full well know, that tho&s;e Warres which are not al|together nece&s;&s;ary, prove oftentimes the mo&s;t &s;adde&s;t unto
<PB N="35" REF="19">tho&s;e who wage them: Wherefore <HI>we did di&s;&s;wade the Polo|nian Warre, by divers and &s;undry Emba&s;&s;ies. The Town of</HI> Stetin, <HI>doth very well know, that we abhorre the very thoughts of that Warre, and that we never had a hand therein, but when we were con&s;trained thereunto;</HI> which you cannot likewi&s;e deny, in ca&s;e you do but call to mind, how that the <HI>Polonian Warre</HI> was no &s;ooner re&s;olved on, but that at the &s;ame time, <HI>you re&s;olved likewi&s;e to engage the Elector therein, whether he would or not:</HI> And we were &s;o farre <HI>from pre&s;&s;ing you to Warre again&s;t</HI> Poland, <HI>that</HI> Wittenberg <HI>was already entred that Kingdome, when your Amba&s;&s;adours came to this Town, to &s;eek unto us, or rather to threaten us, and con&s;train us, to enter into an alliance with you.</HI></P>
<P>We could hardly believe, that you could have the impu|dence, to reproach us in this wi&s;e, unle&s;s you had had a&s;&s;ured proof thereof: Wherefore we required to know of tho&s;e per&s;ons, which make up his Electorall Highne&s;s Council, whether or no their deliberations could in any wi&s;e have given cau&s;e for the &s;aid Accu&s;ation: We have runne over the Drafts of all the Letters, which were thereon written, and we have peru&s;ed all our Regi&s;ters, to di&s;cover, whether hap|pily your cunning, the nece&s;&s;ity of tho&s;e times, and the &s;tate of affairs as then (which were capable, to have moved the firme&s;t con&s;tancy, and the re&s;olute&s;t determinations) might have extorted from us, any thing implying the &s;ame: But we can take God to witne&s;s, That we could not light upon any thing in the lea&s;t, <HI>That might cau&s;e us to &s;u&s;pect our having failed in our fidelity to</HI> Poland, <HI>or of our amity to</HI> Sweden.</P>
<P>For our <HI>Elector</HI> could never &s;ufficiently move the entring on a Peace unto all your Amba&s;&s;adours, nor to recommend it unto tho&s;e, who &s;ided with <HI>Sweden.</HI> True it is, that <HI>he gave ear to your Propo&s;itions; That he accepted tho&s;e advantages, which you proffered him, purpo&s;ely to gain him to your party;</HI> and, <HI>That he did receive your Pre&s;ents:</HI> But all this he did <HI>with an upright heart, and on purpo&s;e to pre&s;erve them for the right owners, lea&s;t they might fall into the hands of &s;trangers.</HI></P>
<P>The refu&s;all which you made, to conde&s;cend to a Peace
<PB N="36" REF="20">with <HI>Poland,</HI> and the Warre wherewithall you threatned the <HI>Ducall Pru&s;&s;ia,</HI> did con&s;train his Electorall Highne&s;s, to enter into a Negotiation with you; and engaged him in a Trea|ty, by which he alwaies hoped he might meet with an occa|&s;ion to &s;erve you, as well as the <HI>Polanders;</HI> to pre&s;erve both the one and the other, by a good Treaty of Peace, and to give a Te&s;timony of his con&s;tant Fidelity to <HI>Po|land.</HI></P>
<P>For which purpo&s;e, our Amba&s;&s;adours were continually with you, and never departed your Court, who ince&s;&s;antly pre&s;&s;ed you to come to a Peace, and who amu&s;ed you, while&s;t we were not as yet gotten into a po&s;ture to defend our &s;elves: However, we &s;ticked not to take up Armes, to continue our Leagues, and to pa&s;s with our Army into <HI>Pru&s;&s;ia,</HI> notwith&s;tanding our oppo&s;itions and threatnings. You may well remember, Gentlemen, what pa&s;&s;ed as then, and what the Elector did, to endeavour to beget a Peace, or to uphold the ju&s;tice and equity of the <HI>Polonian</HI> Forces, by the conjunction of his own; till &s;uch time, as that he &s;aw, he could not obtain any thing at your hands, that was ju&s;t, nor overcome your ob&s;tinacy to de&s;troy all: Wherefore he rather cho&s;e to expect the very la&s;t extreamities, then to fail in that Fidelity, wherein this <HI>generous and good Prince</HI> &s;tood ingaged to the Crown of <HI>Poland.</HI></P>
<P>Both the Royal <HI>Pru&s;&s;ia,</HI> and the Hou&s;e of <HI>Au&s;tria,</HI> and the States of the United <HI>Provinces,</HI> can witne&s;s tho&s;e endea|vours, which were u&s;ed by his Electorall Highne&s;s, for to ingage them in an alliance, which might be &s;ufficient to oppo&s;e the&s;e <HI>&V;&s;urpations:</HI> And we heartily grieve, that the &s;ucce&s;s thereof, did not an&s;wer our Expectations: However, we &s;hall alwaies retain this &s;atisfaction to our &s;elves, <HI>That the Elector never changed his mind, and that he never failed in his duty, but by con&s;traint; No not with</HI> Poland <HI>its &s;elf.</HI></P>
<P>His <HI>Elector all Highne&s;s,</HI> could have wi&s;hed withall his heart, to have &s;een the &s;aid Kingdome in a better condition: But in regard that the King him&s;elf had de&s;erted it; that the Sena|tours had abandoned the management of affairs; that the Souldiers were po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with a general cowerdize; that all
<PB N="37" REF="20">Subjects were treacherous; and that even tho&s;e, who were born, and payed to fight in the defence of that Common|wealth, had taken up Armes again&s;t her: He was con|&s;trained, even to give way to tho&s;e great Evils, which had overwhealmed the whole State.</P>
<P>In&s;omuch, that there cannot be any unbya&s;&s;ed d&s;iinterre&s;&s;ed party, but will prai&s;e the Electors prudence, who in the pre|&s;erving him&s;elf, by the meanes of a Treaty, remained in a condition, both to pre&s;erve <HI>Poland</HI> and <HI>Sweden</HI> together.</P>
<P><HI>Poland</HI> it&s;elf, is di&s;creet and rational enough, to acknow|ledge it, and to avouch: That all nece&s;&s;ary meanes are hone&s;t and lawfull; and that the Obligation of the Lord, and of the Subjects, being reciprocall. The Subject cannot be blamed for having failed, to defend the Lord, in ca&s;e the Lord hath failed to protect the Subject.

<P>Wherefore, we conjure you <HI>(Gentlemen)</HI> without pa&s;&s;ion, to reflect upon the tye, which lieth upon us to endeavour the begetting and pre&s;erving a Peace between <HI>Poland</HI> and <HI>Sweden,</HI> and to maintain their power in a ju&s;t equality; as al&s;o to judg <HI>how little appearance there is, that we &s;hould have obliged your King, to take up Armes again&s;t</HI> Poland: And whether it be not a very di&s;hone&s;t part to alledge: <HI>That we endeavoured to make an alliance for a Warre, which of nece&s;&s;ity, mu&s;t have proved de|&s;tructive to our &s;elves?</HI></P>
<P>We only de&s;ire you chiefly to con&s;ider, how and in what matter you can po&s;&s;ible blame our <HI>reconciliation</HI> with <HI>Poland?</HI> And with what equity the King can condemn our proceed|ings at <HI>Bromberg?</HI> &s;eeing he approved of what had pa&s;&s;ed at <HI>Koningsberg.</HI> And truly, &s;ince you were not a&s;hamed to im|po&s;e a Law, and a nece&s;&s;ity on a Prince your Friend, and to con&s;train him to act again&s;t the Lord of his Mannor, the King ought to harbour &s;o much genero&s;ity, as not to be di&s;|plea&s;ed
<PB N="38" REF="21">to &s;ee that reunited again by a &s;ecret de&s;tiny, which was di&s;united by your violence and force.

<P>We were con&s;trained to &s;ide with you, and &s;o long as the State of our affairs did permit, as to &s;tay by you, we upheld your party with Fidelity, and never abandoned you, till you had de&s;erted us; and had left us to the di&s;cretion of Fortune, without either hopes of a Peace, or of a Relief: Nor can you be ignorant in what a condition the Kings Forces were in, when we drew off, after the Battell of <HI>War&s;ow;</HI> and in what a manner the Enemies recruted them&s;elves after the &s;aid lo&s;s; which in&s;tead of quite ruining them, re&s;tored all their affairs, and put a double proportion of courage into them: We found them marching at our heels, when we thought we had laid them along; and we found them pur|&s;uing us in the reare, laying all wa&s;te, where&s;oever they pa&s;t, and putting all to fire and &s;word; in their pur&s;uite mena|cing us (even after their defeate and flying away) <HI>more like Victors, then overcome men.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Tran&s;ilvanian</HI> trembled, the <HI>Mu&s;covite</HI> threatned us, and the King of <HI>Denmark</HI> thwarted all your de&s;ignes by a new Warre, whereby the King was obliged to abandon the whole, to march unto the relief of the Principality of <HI>Bremn.</HI> In regard whereof, we could not refu&s;e to hearken unto the Remon&s;trances of our Subjects, to the Prayers of our Friends, and to the proffers of our Enemies; or rather, <HI>We were con|&s;trained to make a Peace with</HI> Poland, and to accept of tho&s;e conditions which were proffered us, although they had been farre le&s;s equitable then tho&s;e, which were grant|ed us.</P>

<P>In&s;omuch, as that all men mu&s;t needs perceive, there was no choice left to be made at that time; and that his <HI>Electoral Highne&s;&s;e,</HI> being not able any longer to re&s;i&s;t the &s;trength of nece&s;&s;ity, was con&s;trained to bethink him&s;elf of minding his own bui&s;ne&s;s, and to pre&s;erve him&s;elf by meanes of a Trea|ty.

<P>We full well know, that it is not your cu&s;tom to harbour any complai&s;ance for your Friends: In&s;omuch, as that by your boa&s;ting, <HI>to have permitted the Elector to enter into a Nego|tiation for a Newtrality,</HI> you confe&s;s you have done more, then you believed you were bound to do; becau&s;e you do in &s;ome manner acknowledge, that amid&s;t our humane actions, there happens &s;ome conjunctures which oblige us to give way unto nece&s;&s;ity.

<P>We are a&s;hamed to repre&s;ent unto you, in a large di&s;cour&s;e, all tho&s;e things which you know we have done for you; nei|ther are we di&s;po&s;ed to reproach you with the proofes of the friend&s;hip and good will which our Prince hath te&s;tified unto you in &s;uch a manner, as well as tho&s;e Obligations you are indebted to him for what he did at the execution of the fir&s;t Treaty; you your &s;elves do know it full well, and your Letters which do &s;o often promi&s;e an external acknowledg|ment thereon to his Electorall Highne&s;s, will alwaies te&s;ti|fie the &s;ame unto po&s;terity.

<P>However, we do not deny, that we ever undertook a|ny Warre, &s;ave with a re&s;olution to let &s;lip no occa&s;ions to make Peace, and to re-e&s;tabli&s;h the publique tranquility; to which end, we often &s;topped your extravagancies, by pro|po&s;itions of an accommodation, which we did not only pro|mote, but al&s;o urged them mo&s;t pre&s;&s;ingly, even in the mid&s;t of our Victories. For we repre&s;ented unto our &s;elves warre with all its &s;equell of evils; we conceived that the advanta|ges of our Armes were to be made u&s;e of, to &s;mother the &s;aid fire, as al&s;o to di&s;per&s;e the very a&s;hes of it.

<P>In regard whereof, the Prince Elector being &s;en&s;ibly touch|ed with all the&s;e di&s;orders, and &s;eeing that the &s;tate of affairs required him to take a &s;trong re&s;olution either to prevent and remedy them, or to peri&s;h: he would e&s;&s;ay whether his ex|ample might prove capable to bring you back unto rea&s;on; or at lea&s;t in ca&s;e our &s;innes would not permit us to hope that, to try whether all hone&s;t men might not be per&s;waded, <HI>That it was not his fault the Peace was not made, and that all the North at this pre&s;ent doth not enjoy a profound Tranquillity.</HI></P>

<P>The Lord <HI>Wolsberg,</HI> your Re&s;ident in our Court, continued his Offices hereon with &s;o much urgency, as that we &s;hall not need to &s;pecifie Mr. <HI>Toph&s;on</HI>'s and Mr. <HI>Blondel</HI>'s in&s;tances which they added, on the behalf of the King of <HI>France,</HI> and of <HI>Eng|land;</HI> nor the &s;everall Emba&s;&s;ies which the Dukes of <HI>Brun&s;|wick, Lunenburg,</HI> and the Lant&s;grave of <HI>He&s;s,</HI> have &s;ent unto us, as upon the &s;ame account: In&s;omuch as that it needs not to be wondred at, if the Elector, who of him&s;elf had a great inclination to Peace, at length did yeeld to the coun&s;ils of &s;o many illu&s;trious Per&s;onages.</P>

<P>Truly we are a&s;hamed to recount all the&s;e particulars; you very well know, <HI>that we alwaies prote&s;ted, we were &s;o farre from being charged with declarations of Warre, as that we were laden with propo&s;itions, which could not choo&s;e but be welcome.</HI> But becau&s;e we have formerly enlarged upon this point in the Letter which we wrote from <HI>Hamborrow;</HI> we believe we may conclude, that his <HI>Electorall Highne&s;s intention being good, pious, and glorious;</HI> and the Emba&s;&s;ie well ordered and con&s;ented unto; doubtle&s;s, no body will &s;tick to a|vouch, <HI>That the King by his &s;o evill intreating us, and by not r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">|garding us as he ought to have done, hath violated the peace, and hath too ra&s;hly rejected our amity.</HI></P>
<P>For in ca&s;e the King reflected upon the Teaty which the E|lector made with <HI>Poland;</HI> why did he not regard us as <HI>Am|ba&s;&s;adours from an Elector of the Empire?</HI> &s;ince you your &s;elves would be otherwi&s;e con&s;idered <HI>then Swedes,</HI> and otherwi&s;e then <HI>Princes of the Empire; and that in Sweden you would be Enemies, but in the Empire friends to the King of Poland?</HI> If he knew the E|lector was his Enemy, why did he de&s;ire him to &s;end his Am|ba&s;&s;adours? why did he receive them? and why did he treat them civily? and if he received them, <HI>why did he refu&s;e them audience?</HI> &s;o wi&s;e a King as him&s;elf, ought either not to have received them, or having received them, ought not to have denied them audience, unle&s;s he will a&s;&s;ume that authority to him&s;elf <HI>to abu&s;e the Princes of the Empire, by rejecting and driving away the Amba&s;&s;adours,</HI> however we are loath to be|lieve &s;o much of him.</P>
<P>You alledge it is true, <HI>that the dignity of the Common-wealth permits not an audience to be given to the Amba&s;&s;adours of an Enemy in the Senate.</HI> But how can you believe that the Elector was the Enemy? &s;ince he laboured in <HI>Pru&s;&s;ia,</HI> towards the procuring of an Agreement, even with your con&s;ents; and that he rather endeavoured Peace then Warre, and how can you convince him of the lea&s;t ho&s;tilities in the Empire, un|le&s;s you conceit you build them upon imaginary apprehen|&s;ions;
<PB N="56" REF="30">or upon the uncertain reports which are &s;pread a|broade, again&s;t which there are other remedies then force and violence; Time would have taught you the one, and the divine providence accompanied by an innocent precauti|on, would have cured you of the other.</P>
<P>But &s;uppo&s;e the Elector had declared him&s;elf again&s;t you that could not ju&s;tifie you neither; For the example of &s;eve|rall Pagans would have taught you, <HI>that there is nothing ought to hinder the hearing of an Amba&s;&s;adour,</HI> no not from declared Enemies: were it but to let the world &s;ee, <HI>that you only wage Warre to obtaine Peace.</HI> The fir&s;t Chri&s;tians would have made a &s;cruple of con&s;cience to have done otherwi&s;e; But to de&s;ire a Prince to &s;end his Amba&s;&s;adours, to make much of them, to receive them at Court, and afterwards to &s;end them away again, refu&s;ing them audience; is a thing not only un|heard of, but again&s;t all piety, again&s;t the publick faith, and again&s;t the Law of Nations.</P>
<P>We marvell that you endeavour to excu&s;e this reproach by the Maxime, <HI>That the Law of Nations and former cu&s;tomes, per|mit the receiving of Amba&s;&s;adours, according unto the dignity of the Prince which &s;ends them; and in relation unto the nature of the bui&s;ne&s;s whereon they are to Treat;</HI> all which is ju&s;t as much as nothing; For that is only to be under&s;tood, as to the cere|monies and exterior honours which are u&s;ually done to the per&s;ons of Amba&s;&s;adours; which is not our di&s;pute: we are agreed as to the ceremonies; in&s;omuch as that if you would deliberate, whether you &s;hould receive the Emba&s;&s;ie or no, whether the Elector &s;hould be con&s;idered as a declared Ene|my, or as a &s;u&s;pected Prince, who was ready to Arme again&s;t you; that you might have done at lea&s;t, if you could have con|ceived us to have been &s;uch, before your having approved of our Emba&s;&s;ie, by your receiving of us. We do not deny, but that &s;ometimes Amba&s;&s;adours may be refu&s;ed to be recei|ved; but to deny tho&s;e Amba&s;&s;adours audience, who have been received, this we deny expre&s;ly; and do judg it the more extravagant, &s;ince in things of &s;o high an importance, Sovereigns cannot proceed with too much circum&s;pection.</P>
<P>We likewi&s;e &s;ay, that it is an unheard of thing, to go about
<PB N="57" REF="30">to oblige an Amba&s;&s;adour, who hath been received, and acknowledged as &s;uch, to declare the &s;ubject of his Emba&s;&s;ie, and his &s;ecret In&s;tructions, before he hath &s;poken with the par|ty unto whom he is &s;ent; and likewi&s;e to endeavour to force him to undergo a kinde of Interrogatory before Commi&s;&s;io|ners, <HI>this is very impertinent.</HI></P>
<P>All men know that the Character of an Amba&s;&s;adour, is mo&s;t holy and inviolable between Princes and Soveraignes, and that from all ages, and among&s;t all people, they have been received with honour and re&s;pect, and that their per&s;ons are held in the more veneration, by rea&s;on they repre&s;ent tho&s;e Kings and Princes by whom they are &s;ent. Now whether this be performed or no, by tho&s;e manner of proceedings which you u&s;e, we de&s;ire you your &s;elves (Gentlemen) to judge.</P>
<P>Truly we believe that there is not one among&s;t you, who would not be offended; if a friend having appointed you an houre to come and vi&s;it him, &s;hould let you &s;tay in the Hall, and &s;hould &s;end to know of you by a Foot-boy or &s;ome o|ther of his done&s;tick Servants, that thing which you would not di&s;clo&s;e &s;ave unto him&s;elf; But there is great deale of dif|ference between Princes and particuler Per&s;ons: wherefore we be&s;eech you to con&s;ider, whether the mo&s;t barborous Nations in the world would not be laughed at, &s;hould they undertake to examine tho&s;e Amba&s;&s;adours which are &s;ent unto them, and require of them the &s;ubject of their Emba&s;&s;ie; and con&s;equently whether this kind of proceeding be not im|pertinent, and in&s;u&s;portable, e&s;pecially among &s;uch as pro|fe&s;s civillity; and whether it be a thing to be endured, that the &s;ecret which an Amba&s;&s;adour hath expre&s;s Order to com|municate to none &s;ave the Prince unto whom he is &s;ent, &s;hould be extorted from him.</P>
<P>We &s;hould have derogated from that Character where|withall our Prince had honoured us, had we been &s;o ill ad|vi&s;ed, as not to have made a di&s;tinction betwixt the Prince and his Mini&s;ters: Truely Gentlemen, you &s;hall hardly be able to per&s;wade it us; and therefore we be&s;eech you not to build too much upon the Maxime which you &s;o often u&s;e,
<PB N="58" REF="31">and which makes you &s;werve &s;o farre from the mark, <HI>th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter"> the dignity of the Commonwealth permits not to hear Enemy Am|ba&s;&s;adours in the Senate.</HI> This is no generall rule, nor ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter"> you make u&s;e of that which was heretofore &s;aid only up on the accounts of tho&s;e who came as Spies (and who would be heard without having asked audience) again&s;t us; who came upon the publick Faith, who were invited received, and honoured as Friends, and therefore ought not, nor could be gain&s;aid, nor put by, unle&s;s you did it purpo&s;ely to offend us, wilfully to faile in the point of civillity, and mo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="2 letters"> cruelly to outrage us.</P>
<P>But we have &s;aid too much hereon, the thing being &s;o clear and manife&s;t; <HI>The Lacedemonians, the Florentines, the Duk<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter"> of Nevers, and the Lord of Langey,</HI> have by their example &s;hewn us what is to be done on the like occa&s;ions; to wit, <HI>rather to withdraw then to be affronted.</HI> Wherefore we &s;hall only adde one word, that at the &s;ame time you treated <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;o ill, your Re&s;ident who was with the Electors per&s;on a <HI>Berlin,</HI> was there lodged and defrayed, was admitted to au|dience as often as he plea&s;ed to demand the &s;ame, and re|ceived all the other civilities which could be conferred upon a publick per&s;on.</P>
<P>We confe&s;&s;e we could not imagine what their de&s;igne &s;hould be, by the&s;e your two different manner of actings, and we had rather remit our &s;elves thereon unto others, then to become too importunate, by an overcurious &s;earch|ing thereinto; We de&s;ire not to penetrate into your rea&s;ons, and we will leave it to the di&s;cretion and liberty of others to give your proceedings the blame or prai&s;e they may de&s;erve. But our Prince Elector, who doth nothing but what he would have all the world know; troubles him&s;elf not at all hereat; or in ca&s;e he had remained there to hinder his Electo|rall Highne&s;s from the declaring of him&s;elf; our Prince who only a&s;pires after Peace, de&s;ired nothing &s;o much as that e|ven during the mid&s;t of the Wars.</P>
<P>We may ea&s;ily believe, that you did it purpo&s;ely to en|tertain and amu&s;e us, till &s;uch time as the affairs of <HI>Denmark</HI> being regulated, the King might have proceeded in another
<PB N="59" REF="31">manner with us. <HI>But our generous Prince</HI> vallues this not a &s;traw, for having not at all offended the King, he needed not to apprehend any thing upon that account neither.</P>
<P>And if it be not in regard of what is before &s;aid, at lea&s;t be plea&s;ed to tell us, why did the Lord <HI>Wolfsberg</HI> continue to re|maine by your orders in our Court, and to be admitted to au|dience at all times, whil&s;t you refu&s;ed it unto us at yours? Why do you go about to make the world believe, that the Elector hath declared him&s;elf again&s;t you, <HI>by treating with Poland,</HI> &s;ince even after the &s;aid Treaty, you have had your Mini&s;ters near to the Elector, and have lived in good amity with us? Our in|nocence will not &s;uffer us to &s;u&s;pect the faith of &s;o great a King.</P>
<P>But if we be not deceived in the good opinion we had har|boured of him, the ill treatment which we have newly re|ceived, will not alarm his Electorall Highne&s;s, but only &s;erve to confirme tho&s;e advices, which have been given us from all &s;ides; that it is not from this day you have a minde to quarrell us. That you have long &s;ince harboured that de|&s;ign which you do now di&s;clo&s;e, and that the &s;poiles of <HI>Den|marke</HI> will help you to bring forth that which you have been a hammering and hatching ever &s;ince the beginning of the War. That all your prote&s;tations of friend&s;hip, and acknow|ledgments, have been but &s;o many complements and flatter|ings which your refined wits and &s;hallow braines make u&s;e of to hide their unlimitted ambition by, untill &s;uch time as you &s;hall be in a capacity to manife&s;t it, without &s;hame or feare; as it is u&s;uall to tho&s;e who &s;eek glory otherwi&s;e then through the foot&s;teps of virtue; to endeavour to render tho&s;e guilty, who&s;e E&s;tates they could not po&s;&s;ibly a&s;&s;aile, unle&s;s they made them profe&s;t Enemies.</P>
<P>You know how often you have &s;poken to us concerning <HI>Pru&s;&s;ia,</HI> the <HI>Pillauw,</HI> and <HI>Pomerania;</HI> you know how great a trouble it was to you to di&s;gui&s;e and cloake your in&s;atiable covetuou&s;ne&s;s, even during our greate&s;t friend&s;hip, as well as the troubles and cares which you have cau&s;ed his Electorall Highne&s;s by your unju&s;t and violent demands.</P>
<P>After all which, we cannot doubt but you mu&s;t judg (Gen|tlemen) that by your treating of us as you have done, you
<PB N="60" REF="32">have not done any good either for your &s;elves, or for us; and that your King had done more prudently for the common good of affairs; <HI>If after his inviting of us, receiving and honour|ing of us as friends, he had not turned us off, as Criminals, and &s;ent us back as Enemies.</HI> You may ea&s;ily judge, in ca&s;e you have the lea&s;t inclination for Peace; that we ought to have been heard, although you had taken us for common declared Enemies, and that &s;ince we were not &s;o as yet, you ought thereby to have te&s;tified, that you had &s;ome re&s;pect at lea&s;t to our friend|&s;hip. <HI>By giving audience to the Amba&s;&s;adors of an Elector, you would have manife&s;ted that you had not any de&s;igne again&s;t the Em|pire; and by admitting the Prince of Brandenburgs Amba&s;&s;adours, that you had not yet &s;tifled the re&s;entments of an Allye by him, that you had not renounced the duties of Neighbourhood, and that you were &s;till mindefull of what he hath done for you &s;ome years &s;ince.</HI></P>
<P>But &s;ince it &s;eems it was not con&s;i&s;tent with your plea&s;ure; The Elector findes him&s;elf forced to &s;ay, that he is &s;orry to meet with &s;o great an ob&s;tinacy, whether it proceeds from an animo&s;ity, from a neglect, or by rea&s;on of the pa&s;&s;ing pro|&s;perous &s;ucce&s;&s;es of your forces, and the flattering (though be|guiling) hopes which you have thence received.</P>
<P>This his Electorall Highne&s;s hath commanded us to &s;end you back, in an&s;wer to your trouble&s;ome and uncivill Let|ters which you wrote unto us from <HI>Flensburg;</HI> and with &s;o much the more quietne&s;s of mind, as he hopes to be able to rectifie yours; prote&s;ting, that he is &s;o little moved at the in|ju&s;tice of your proceedings, as that he de&s;pi&s;eth all what&s;oever you &s;hall be able to undertake again&s;t the confidence which he repo&s;eth in the ju&s;tice of his Cau&s;e, and to the prejudice of the repo&s;e of his con&s;cience.</P>
<P>But to the end you may know his true intentions, he doth declare unto you; that having only taken up Armes with a regret, or again&s;t his will, and that having &s;ided with your Party, only when your violence, and the very la&s;t nece&s;&s;ity en|forced him to joyn with you; His re&s;olution is, mo&s;t punctu|ally and religiou&s;ly to performe the promi&s;e he hath made to his Allies, <HI>and to imploy without any re&s;ervation at all, what&s;oever God hath given him, in the procuring of the pre&s;ervation of the Peace of the Empire.</HI></P>
<PB N="61" REF="32">
<P>That he wi&s;heth you all pro&s;perity in tho&s;e things which you &s;hall undertake with ju&s;tice; in&s;omuch, as that in ca&s;e your King can re&s;olve to come to a Peace, the Elector will la|bourtherein with all his might, and will even give way, that it may be compa&s;&s;ed in a manner at his charges.</P>
<P>But and if the King will not hearken to an accommodati|on, his Electorall Highne&s;s doth prote&s;t, that he will make u&s;e of all the meanes which God, nature, the ju&s;tice of his Cau&s;e, and the bublick faith will permit him to employ, for to endea|vour to with&s;tand and repell the violence which &s;hall be of|fered him.</P>
