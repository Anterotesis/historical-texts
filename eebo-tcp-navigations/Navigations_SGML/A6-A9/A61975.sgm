<HEAD>A Summary Narration OF THE Signal Victory which it plea&s;ed Al|mighty God to be&s;tow upon his Ma|je&s;ties Navy, under the Command of his Royall Highne&s;s the Duke of <HI>York,</HI> again&s;t the Fleet of the <HI>States</HI> of the <HI>&V;nited Netherlands,</HI> the 3. of <HI>June</HI> 1665.</HEAD>
<P>_IT is for <HI>general &s;atisfaction,</HI> and to pre|vent <HI>Mi&s;reports</HI> (which are co~monly through ignorance or malice be|gotten upon occa&s;ions of this na|ture) that this pre&s;ent <HI>Narrative</HI> is printed. And to the end that it may be rendred di&s;tinctly and intelligibly (the matter bearing it very well on our &s;ide,) it &s;hal begin with the fir&s;t appearance
<PB N="2" REF="3">of the <HI>Dutch Fleet,</HI> on our <HI>Coa&s;t;</HI> brought thither rather (in all probability) in expectation of finding Ours in di&s;order upon the preceding foul weather, and drawn by the reports of our unreadine&s;s, then from their own innate va|lour, though the report of the &s;tory &s;hews they had &s;ufficient of that to accompany them in this great undertaking.</P>
<P>Upon their <HI>fir&s;t appearance,</HI> which was on <HI>June</HI> 2d. at 2 of the clock, it co&s;t his <HI>Royall Highne&s;s</HI> but little time to make ready; his foregoing care, and the chearfulne&s;s of our men, having pre|vented all hazzard of di&s;order; And the happy arrival of the <HI>Colliers Fleet</HI> at that in&s;tant, having &s;upplyed the onely want we had, of Men: Which the <HI>Dutch</HI> Fleet no &s;ooner perceived, but they &s;tood off to &s;ea again, keeping the wind of us, &s;ometimes &s;tanding again, to &s;ee whether indeed We dur&s;t follovv them, keeping them|&s;elves in good order. Their number vvas then judged to be 10 <HI>Sail,</HI> and 10 <HI>Fire-&s;hips.</HI> The fir&s;t good Omen that &s;hevved it &s;elf on Our &s;ide, vvas the firing a great Ship of theirs that Even|ing, then believed to be one of their Flag Ships, which vve &s;ince have learned vvas a great Fire-&s;hip &s;o di&s;gui&s;ed to do the more mi&s;chief.</P>
<P><HI>June</HI> 2. We follovved them till night; and
<PB N="3" REF="3">endeavoured by &s;everal <HI>Tacks</HI> to get the Wind|vvard quarter, vvhich his <HI>Royall Highne&s;s</HI> happi|ly effected, being not full tvvo leagues further into the &s;ea then vve vvere the Evening before: vvhich being gained, they bore up tovvards us, and gave the fir&s;t <HI>Broad &s;ide</HI> at <HI>Sunri&s;ing Saturday</HI> 3. But finding they could not get from us, they bore up to <HI>Vice Admiral Minnes,</HI> and gave him a <HI>broad&s;ide,</HI> who received them accordingly; and &s;o their whole <HI>Fleet</HI> pa&s;&s;ed by <HI>Ours,</HI> &s;tring at every &s;hip as they went, and receiving re|turnes from them; not one of either &s;ide be|ing out of play at this fir&s;t encounter. Imme|diately upon which, his <HI>Royall Highne&s;s</HI> made his &s;igne for the <HI>tacking,</HI> that we might &s;till keep the wind of them, which was happily executed, notwith&s;tanding that the <HI>enemy</HI> al&s;o &s;trove for it. In the <HI>&s;econd pa&s;s,</HI> the <HI>Swift&s;ure</HI> bore the <HI>fir&s;t brunt,</HI> which was performed on both &s;ides as the former. In the <HI>third</HI> (wherein we al&s;o kept the wind) <HI>Prince Rupert,</HI> and <HI>Cap|tain Minnes</HI> led the way but the Enemy, endea|vouring to get the head of our whole Fleet, we engaged in a line, and as we bore towards them, they &s;till bore off, yet &s;teering the &s;ame Cour&s;e, &s;o that it was not then a fight of <HI>board and board,</HI> But offending one another with great &s;hot, we being at too great a di&s;tance to
<PB N="4" REF="4">make u&s;e of our &s;mall; which way of fighting &s;eeming tedious to us, about one of the Clock we pa&s;&s;ed &s;o near about the middle of them, that we devided their Fleet. About three of the <HI>Clock Opdams</HI> Ship was blown up; as we &s;uppo&s;e by a lucky &s;hot in the <HI>powder-room,</HI> which amazed <HI>Their</HI> whole Fleet, as it encou|raged <HI>Ours,</HI> &s;o we fell in <HI>Pell-mell,</HI> with them. After vvhich, it will be hard, till &s;tories are well compo&s;ed, to give a particular account of vvhat hapned: Upon the vvhole matter, God hath been plea&s;ed to give his Maje&s;tie <HI>a great</HI> and <HI>&s;ignal Victory,</HI> the <HI>enemy</HI> being driven into the <HI>Texell</HI> as far as the draught of vvater and the condition of our &s;hips vvould permit; the day being al&s;o very far &s;pent: the &s;umme of all is, the enemies vvhole Fleet is defeated; the greate&s;t part of them gone into the <HI>Texel,</HI> o|thers into the <HI>Maes;</HI> about 30 of them <HI>burnt</HI> or <HI>taken. Opdam</HI> vvith his <HI>&s;hip, blown up; Tromp</HI> and <HI>Cortenaer, Skram</HI> and <HI>Stellingwer&s;&s;e,</HI> all their 7 <HI>Admirals</HI> but <HI>John Evert&s;on</HI> killed; vvith ma|ny more of their principal Officers, and accord|ing to their general computation neare 8000. <HI>&s;eamen</HI> and <HI>&s;ouldiers;</HI> on <HI>our &s;ide</HI> only one &s;ingle &s;hip, (the <HI>Charity</HI>) lo&s;t, Sir <HI>John Law&s;on</HI> received a &s;light hurt in his knee, the Lord of <HI>Marle|borough;</HI> The Lord of <HI>Portland;</HI> Captain <HI>Athel|ton</HI>
<PB N="5" REF="4">of the <HI>Guiny,</HI> Captain <HI>Kirby</HI> of the <HI>Breda,</HI> and <HI>Rear Admiral San&s;on,</HI> vvere &s;lain; Al&s;o the Lord of <HI>Falmouth,</HI> the Lord of <HI>Mu&s;kery</HI> and Mr. <HI>Boyle</HI> which three la&s;t vvere killed by one unhap|py &s;hot on board his <HI>Royal Highne&s;s,</HI> and clo&s;e to his ovvn per&s;on: God of Heaven be prai&s;|ed for having pre&s;erved him to be the great In|&s;trument of &s;o &s;ignal a &s;ucce&s;s, to the honour of His Maje&s;ty; and the good of his peo|ple.</P>
