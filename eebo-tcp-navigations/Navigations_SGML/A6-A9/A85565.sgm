<LETTER LANG="eng">
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>ON Wedne&s;day la&s;t, being the 7. of this in&s;tant there happened a great and bloudy Fight at Sea between the Engli&s;h and the Iri&s;h, neere the Coa&s;t of <HI>Ireland,</HI> the manner thus: Capt. <HI>Peacocke</HI> (a man of known and faithfull integrity to the Parlia|ment) &s;ayling towards the Iri&s;h Seas with five Men of War, for cleering the channell about <HI>Dublin</HI> of Pyrates
<PB N="4" REF="3">and Robbers, di&s;covered a Fleet of &s;hips about three leagues di&s;tant, who immediatly made towards them, and comming within Canon-&s;hot, hayled them in, to know what they were, and whence they was bound; who replyed, that they belonged to the Parliament of <HI>Eng|land,</HI> and were bound for the relief of <HI>Dublin;</HI> but &s;ay|ling near to each other, Captain <HI>Peacock</HI> di&s;covered them to be Enemies, who pre&s;ently gave them a broad &s;ide; whereupon the Enemies Rear-Admirall an&s;werd them with another Volley, in&s;omuch that a hot di&s;pute began, continuing for the &s;pace of an hour, and although the Enemy was two for one, yet (by divine providence, and the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Almighty) by the gallantry of the &s;aid Captain <HI>Peacock,</HI> and his Sea-men, he became victorious, and after a bloudy Conflict, &s;unk two of the Enemies &s;hips, and near upon 70. men, and boarded the Rear-Admirall; the re&s;t e&s;caped having a faire Gale of Wind to &s;eparate them from their Engagement, and the raging Billowes forcing them to the Ocean for &s;anctu|ary.</P>
<P>This Fleet con&s;i&s;ted of ten Sayl, five whereof belong|ing to the Princes Fleet, the re&s;t Iri&s;h, who were de&s;ig|ned again&s;t <HI>Dublin.</HI></P>
<P>The &s;hip which was boarded, was called the <HI>Patrick,</HI> being Rear-admirall to the Fleet, wherein was forty piece of Ordnance, &s;ix Tun of Match, twenty Barrels of powder, and about two hundred Sea-men.</P>
<P>In this Conflict divers were &s;lain on both &s;ides, Cap|tain <HI>Peacock</HI> lo&s;t near upon twenty men, and his owne &s;hip (called the Dragon) was in great danger of being &s;unk, who leaked exceedingly betwixt Wind and Wa|ter; but by the great ingenuity and vigilancy of the car|penters
<PB N="5" REF="3">&s;he was pre&s;erved: the Enemies lo&s;&s;e is very great, and doth far exceed the other: and many of the pri&s;oners now in cu&s;tody exceedingly wounded. This happy newes was communicated unto us by a Fi&s;her|man, who with his Bark &s;truck into this Harbour, being cha&s;ed from Sea by the di&s;per&s;ed Fleet.</P>
<P>Upon proclaiming of the late Act of parliament, and fixing it upon po&s;ts, the adver&s;e party &s;eemed to be much grieved thereat, and when the dark Curtaines of the mo&s;t high Canopy were drawn, they cau&s;ed the &s;aid <HI>Act</HI> to be pulled down, and in &s;tead thereof, cau&s;ed a mo&s;t trea&s;onable paper to be &s;et up, wherein they de|clared their inveterate malignancy, to &s;acrifice their lives and fortunes. in the defence and pre&s;ervation of Monarchical Government, &amp;c.</P>
<P>But all diligent care is taken for di&s;covery of the chief abetters and Fomenters of the &s;aid trea&s;onable paper; which they perceiving, begin now to be very &s;ilent.</P>
<P>There are great di&s;contents appearing in &s;everal parts throughout North and South Wales; but their de&s;ign is (as yet) of &s;mall maturity, and its conceived will not be of any con&s;equence, unle&s;&s;e <HI>Laughornes</HI> Brother, and others from <HI>Ireland</HI> prove in&s;trumentall for the delive|ry of this great Machavilian Mon&s;ter into the World; but we hope it will now be fru&s;trated, by rea&s;on of the late blow given to the Enemy at Sea.</P>
