<HEAD>A True and Particular RELATION OF THE VICTORY Obtained by the Chri&s;tian Armies again&s;t the Turks, At <HI>Barkan,</HI> the Ninth of <HI>October,</HI> 1683.</HEAD>
<P>THE King of <HI>Poland</HI> and the Duke of <HI>Lorrain</HI> having made a Meen of Attacking <HI>Newheu&s;el,</HI> in which the Turks have a very &s;trong Gari&s;on, they on the &s;uddain repa&s;&s;ed the <HI>Danube</HI> near <HI>Comorra,</HI> re&s;olving to po&s;&s;e&s;s them&s;elves of <HI>Barkan, Pe&s;t, Agria,</HI> and other important Po&s;ts, thereby to &s;ecure their Winter-Quarters in the <HI>&V;pper Hun|gary.</HI> The King of <HI>Poland</HI> advanced with his Forces on the &s;eventh of <HI>October;</HI> and being arrived near <HI>Barkan,</HI> immediately Attacked that Fort, which &s;e|cures the Bridge of <HI>Gran.</HI> The Turks defended it with the greater Cou|rage, for that they were &s;upported by a very con&s;iderable Body of cho&s;en Men; a great Detachement whereof, whiles the Poles were engaged in the Attack of the Fort, pa&s;&s;ed undi&s;covered, and fell upon the Chri&s;tians in their Rear, and their Flank, and put them into great di&s;order. The King performed the part of a great General, and the mo&s;t daring Soldier, mingling him&s;elf with the young Prince his Son among the thicke&s;t of the Enemy; who with great fury pu&s;hed on the advantage they had, and pre&s;&s;ed the Poles very hard, of whom 14 or 1500 were killed upon the Place; and among the&s;e, the Palatine of <HI>Pomerelle,</HI> and &s;everal brave Officers.</P>
<P>The Duke of <HI>Lorrain</HI> having under&s;tood the danger the King was in, advanced with the Imperial Hor&s;e and Dragoons with all the &s;peed he was able, and came very opportunely to his A&s;&s;i&s;tance; and the Turks &s;eeing the Imperiali&s;ts appear, pre&s;ently retired.</P>
<P>On the Eighth, the Imperial Infantry came up, and the next day the King and the Duke re&s;olved again to Attack <HI>Barkan.</HI> The Armies being drawn up in Batallia accordingly advanced, the Imperiali&s;ts having the Right Wing. A Body of between 12 and 15000 Turks, all cho&s;en Men, encamped in the Neighbourhood; They &s;eeing the Chri&s;tians come on, advanced with a full
<PB N="2" REF="2">&s;peed, and mo&s;t hideous Cries, being encouraged with the Advantage they had had on the Poles two days before. The Chri&s;tians kept them&s;elves clo&s;e and firm as a Wall, the Turks were not able to break in upon them, but were vigorou&s;ly repul&s;ed; and then, leaving the Imperiali&s;ts, they turned towards the Poles, and made an Attack upon them: But here they were likewi&s;e very well received, and many of them fell, the Poles with great Bravery re|venging the lo&s;s they &s;uffered on the Seventh; and they were &s;econded by the Imperiali&s;ts, and particularly by the Regiment of <HI>Caprara.</HI> The Turks being now hard pre&s;&s;ed upon, and two of their Ba&s;&s;a's being &s;lain, and another taken Pri&s;oner, they fled. The Chri&s;tians pur&s;ued them; &s;ome threw them&s;elves into <HI>Barkan,</HI> and others got over the <HI>Danube,</HI> but the Bridge break|ing, tho&s;e that remained behind were mo&s;t of them &s;lain, &s;ome drowned, and the re&s;t taken pri&s;oners, &s;o that of the whole Body not above 3 or 4000 e&s;caped; And at the &s;ame time the Regiment of <HI>Ca&s;telli</HI> and &s;ome other com|manded Troops made them&s;elves Ma&s;ters of the Outworks of <HI>Barkan</HI> with their Swords in their hands, and put all the Turks that were in the Counter&s;carp and in the Ditch to the Sword, but gave Quarter to 500 Jani&s;aries which were in the place, and who yeilded on di&s;cretion. The plunder which the Chri&s;ti|ans had in <HI>Barkan,</HI> and in the Camp of this Body of Turks, appointed by the Grand Vi&s;ier to Cover <HI>Gran,</HI> as well as <HI>Barkan,</HI> was very great; 20 Pieces of Cannon were taken with great quantities of Ammunition and Provi&s;ions, and many fine Hor&s;es, with very rich Furniture; And the Pri&s;oners declare that the Turks, who were before in a great con&s;ternation, will not after this fre&s;h di&s;grace be able to make any con&s;iderable re&s;i&s;tance in any place.</P>
<P>During the Action the Turks in <HI>Barkan</HI> were not wanting to employ their Cannon again&s;t the Chri&s;tians, notwith&s;tanding which, and the continual fire of their Musketeers, the Imperial Foot and Dragoons, being commanded by the Count <HI>de Staremberg,</HI> forced the Counter&s;carp, which was very well pa|li&s;adoed, and &s;lew a great many of the Turks, who e&s;caping out of the Field, took &s;helter there. They in <HI>Gran</HI> likewi&s;e fired upon the Chri&s;tians, but did them little harm, and could not hinder their ruining entirely their bridge. The 10, the Bridge of Boats, which the Chri&s;tians made u&s;e of in their pa&s;&s;ing the <HI>Danube</HI> near <HI>Comorra</HI> arrived, and that day, and the follow|ing, the Imperial and Poli&s;h Troops pa&s;&s;ed the River to be&s;iege <HI>Gran,</HI> the principal Fortifications whereof are it's &s;aid in a very ill condition, and the place badly provided with Ammunition and Cannon, the Grand Vi&s;ier having &s;up|plyed him&s;elf from thence for the Siege of <HI>Vienna.</HI> This Victory as it is very con&s;iderable in it &s;elf, the Turks having here the Flower of their Army, &s;o will in all likelihood be greater in its con&s;equences, for the Courage as well as Forces of the Enemy being broken, <HI>Gran</HI> will not be able to make any great defence; and being taken, <HI>Newheu&s;el</HI> will be deprived of all communication with the Turki&s;h Territories, and be in a manner blockt up. And &s;everal other places will probably without any great oppo&s;ition, fall into the hands of the Chri&s;tians.</P>
<P>It is &s;aid that 10000 Germans and Croats, being reinforced with the Troops of the Count <HI>de Budiani</HI> and others, which a&s;&s;embled on the Frontiers of <HI>Stiria,</HI> have attacked <HI>Cani&s;a,</HI> in which, they had advice, were but 800 men, and tho&s;e in want of Ammunition and Provi&s;ions; but this will need a Confirmation.</P>
