<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_AFter a long pur&s;uit of the Hollan|ders upon this Northern Ocean, with great difficulties (at la&s;t) we came to act the Theater of Europes Tra|gedy, and to di&s;pute the ground-work with fiery Arguments, and Canon Darts, which was with great re&s;olution performed both
<PB N="4" REF="3">by the A&s;&s;ailants and Defendants. But af|ter a &s;harp fight, with &s;om of their be&s;t men of War, (having taken five, and &s;unk three) we bore up to them, with &s;uch Thunder|cracks, and &s;houts of joy, that the lightning of our Canon, &s;oon deaded the &s;pirits of the Dutch-men, and in le&s;s then half an ho: we became victorious, di&s;per&s;ing the whole Navy; upon which atchievement, we took &s;even gallant Men of War, one hundred of their fi&s;her Ve&s;&s;els, and about two thou&s;and pri&s;oners; the chief Officers whereof are committed to &s;afe cu&s;tody; mo&s;t of the pri|vate &s;ouldiery have taken up Arms for the Commonwealth of England. In this con|flict we had many killed and wounded; but lo&s;t not one &s;hip.</P>
<P>The Enemy declining Engagement, our Gene|ral was the fir&s;t that bore up to them, in pur&s;uit of Victory; the James headed the Re&s;olution; and made up to the Enemy, with the re&s;t of the Fleet
<PB N="5" REF="3">attending the motion; which the Enemy perceiv|ing, endeavoured to recover the Sound, and accord|ingly effected the &s;ame; but General Blake being adverti&s;ed of their De&s;ign, &s;ent a Me&s;&s;age to the K. of Denmark, be&s;eeching his Maje&s;ty to prohibit &s;anctuary for any &s;uch A&s;&s;iniators. Whereupon he drew off from the Sound, to the end that he might invite them to the Ocean; the Dutch having notice thereof, weighed anchor, and then re&s;olved to play out their Game; but our General (though an ene|my to the Card, plaid the Trump between Han&s;e and the Sound; &s;o that 300 of the Hollanders flew up, and de&s;cended at Bre&s;&s;ies Bay (an Iland) in Scot|land, where they are fortifying; and intrenching them&s;elves, re&s;olving to di&s;pute the Game with Us. But believe me Sir, if Mr. Vantrump receives &s;uch bu&s;&s;ing after this rate but a little while longer, his mighty Ma&s;ters will hardly embrace him, for his great pains in neglecting their un&s;atiable belly-tim|ber.</P>

<PB N="6" REF="4">
<P>By an Expre&s;s from Port&s;mouth it is certified, That on the 21 in&s;tant Sir George Ay&s;cue came upon the We&s;tern Coa&s;t with fifty gallant Men of War, and intends to expedite after the eighteen &s;ail of Dutch, &s;ent from Vantrump to convoy the Ea&s;t-India &s;hips to their de&s;ired Ports: the wind was very fair for him, till he came neer the Road of Port&s;mouth, but then turn'd full again&s;t him; &s;o that he &s;tood in to the Bay for an hour or two, and then taking the be|nefit of the Tyde bore up again to Sea, and by that time it was dark got cleer of Bem|bridge point: indeed his putting in there, though not intended by him, proved very providential for the Councel of States Let|ters to Sir George, coming an hour before night, were immediatly &s;ent to him: He &s;til beares up after the Enemy, and its believed a good account will be given of his heroick Atchievements very &s;uddenly; for he em|braceth
<PB N="7" REF="4">braceth all opportunities, and exceeding vi|gilant in his motion.</P>
<P>The Zealanders have put to Sea a Fleet of Three&s;core &s;ayl, which lye hovering a|bout their own Coa&s;t to &s;ecure their Mer|chants and Fi&s;her-men, rather then to en|gage further in the publique &s;ervice. Van heer de Witte is Commander in chief, and a great favourite he is to the Royal family, as appears by his carrying on, and declaring for the King of Scots intere&s;t; who is expe|cted daily at the Hague, where great prepa|rations are making for his reception and en|tertainment; for indeed he hath been much &s;olicited by the E&s;tates of the United Pro|vinces; and upon advice with his Councel, it was determined; what the i&s;&s;ue will be, few dayes will manife&s;t.</P>
<P>We have likewi&s;e received Adverti&s;e|ments, that the Queen of Sweden hath &s;et forth four&s;core &s;ayl of &s;hips, all Men of
<PB N="8" REF="5">War, but whether they are bound, they are not plea&s;ed to declare, but ride on &s;till with Commi&s;&s;ion in pocket, having already pa&s;|&s;ed the Zound.</P>
<P>The Dutch have made a League with the King of Denmark, and having hired the Zound for 140000 Pattacoons, or dollors per annum, by which meanes the Swedes will be inforced to pay Toll; yet notwith|&s;tanding they are in a League defen&s;ive with Sweden again&s;t Denmark, and defen&s;ive with Denmark again&s;t Sweden; they are al|&s;o in a League offen&s;ive and defen&s;ive with France; and a League de non offendo with Spain.</P>
