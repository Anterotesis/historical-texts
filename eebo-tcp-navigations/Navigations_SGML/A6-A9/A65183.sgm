<HEAD>The Voyages and Travels of Sir <HI>Francis Drake.</HI></HEAD>
<P>SIr <HI>Francis Drake</HI> was born at <HI>Ip&s;wich,</HI> and in his Youth put Ap|prentice to a Ma&s;ter of a Ve&s;&s;el, during which time he gave him&s;elf wholly to the &s;tudy of Marine Affairs and grew &s;o per|fect therein, that he in the end became the World's Wonder, the Nation's Glory and Terror to his Enemies; in demon&s;tration of which, I &s;hall declare his &s;everal Voyages and great Atcheivements, till his Death.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> Having by his many Exploits gained great Applau&s;e, and the Reputation of an able Sea-man, was made Captain of a &s;mall Ve&s;&s;el by Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> and imployed again&s;t the Spaniard, her mortal Ene|my, from whom he took divers Prizes near Home; but not &s;o con|tented, he, on the 24th of <HI>May,</HI> 1575, &s;et &s;ail in the <HI>Pa&s;chal of Ply|mouth,</HI> a Ship of 70 Tuns, and mounted with 10 Guns, accompanied with the <HI>Swan,</HI> a Ship of 25 Tuns, and 8 Guns, commanded by his Brother <HI>John Drake;</HI> having on Bord both the Ve&s;&s;els, 73 Men and Boys, with other Nece&s;&s;aries, and having a fair Wind, came to <HI>Guadalupa,</HI> one of the <HI>We&s;t India</HI> I&s;lands, on the 29th of <HI>June,</HI> but found nothing there, except &s;ome few Cottages made of Boughs, and covered with <HI>P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">lmata</HI> Leaves, which &s;ecured them from Rain, in the Nature of Tiles yet they had &s;ight of two <HI>Canows</HI> but could not reach them, by rea&s;on the Calm was &s;o great. The&s;e <HI>Canows</HI> are Boats which the <HI>Indians</HI> u&s;e, being for the mo&s;t part cut out of Trees like Troughs, and a piece of Wood fixed on either &s;ide, to keep them from overturn|ing: Whereupon, after they had watered there, they weighed Anchor, and &s;ailed to <HI>Port Phe&s;ant,</HI> &s;o named, becau&s;e of the abundance of that &s;ort of Fowl found there; and there going on Shoar, found that one Mr. <HI>Garret</HI> of <HI>Plymouth</HI> had been lately there, and had left an In&s;crip|tion in Lead nailed to a Tree, to warn him not to &s;tay in that Port, fora&s;much as the Spaniards had notice of his Arrival; yet landing more Forces, he re&s;olved to &s;tay and build a Pinnace, which he effected, for|tifying the Port in the mean while, to prevent any Surprize. And whil&s;t they &s;tayed there, a Bark came from the <HI>I&s;le of Wight,</HI> bringing in a Spa|ni&s;h Prize, which joyn'd with Capt. <HI>Drake;</HI> &s;o that having fini&s;h'd the Pinnace, the 3 Ships and Pinnace &s;ailed to the <HI>I&s;le of Pinos,</HI> where they found 2 Spani&s;h Ships of <HI>Nombre de Dios,</HI> lading Timber by the Negroes. By tho&s;e Ve&s;&s;els they were informed of the State of the City and Coun|try, and that new Forces we<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">e daily expected, to defend it again&s;t the
<PB N="3" REF="2"> Symerons, a black People, with long Hair, who had revolted from the Spaniards, by rea&s;on of their Cruelty, and &s;ince cho&s;en them&s;elves two Kings. Whereupon &s;etting the Negroes on Shoar with &s;ome gifts, Capt. <HI>Drake</HI> re&s;olved to go to <HI>Nombre de Dios,</HI> which he entered by Night, beating the Spaniards from their Defences, who hung Lines a thwart the Ea&s;t-end of the Street, to make the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> believe, by the lighted Matches tyed thereon, that their Forces were greater than indeed they were, and immediately fired, which was an&s;wered with a like num|ber of Fire-&s;hot and arrows from the Engli&s;h; they came to pu&s;h of Pike, and Butt-end of the Musket, upon which the Spaniards fled, and the King's Trea&s;ury con&s;i&s;ting of 360 Tun of Silver Bars, and a like Va|lue of Gold, had fell into the Hands of the Engli&s;h, had not Capt. <HI>Drake</HI> been unfortunately wounded in the Leg, which cau&s;ed the lo&s;s of &s;o much Blood that he fainted; yet neverthele&s;s he per&s;waded his Men to per&s;i&s;t, for that the like Advantage could not be expected to be regained, if it was once omitted; but they preferring their Captain's Life before the Trea&s;ure, forced him on Ship-board. In this Battle only one <HI>Eng|li&s;h</HI> Man was killed, and three or four wounded by the Weapons the E|nemy had ca&s;t away in their Flight; &s;everal of the Spaniards were kil|led, and taken Pri&s;oners. But Capt. <HI>Drake</HI> being now on Ship-board, and well perceiving the Spaniards had encrea&s;ed their Forces, thought it not convenient with &s;o &s;mall a Number, to make a &s;econd Attempt, therefore taking a Ve&s;&s;el laden with Wines, which at his coming he found in the Port, he &s;et &s;ail for the Port <HI>Plenty,</HI> and there, by the Ad|vice of a Negro, carre&s;&s;ed the Symerons found there, who being mor|tal Enemies to the Spaniards, joyned friend&s;hip with him, and greatly furthered his Affairs: and &s;ailing thence towards <HI>Carthagena,</HI> he took a great Ship richly laden, and after that another, in which were two of the Spani&s;h King's <HI>Scrivendoes,</HI> who were &s;ent from <HI>Nombre de Di s,</HI> with the News of what had hapne<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter"> there. Yet he acted not &s;o &s;ecretly, but that his coming was known to the <HI>Cartagenians,</HI> who taking the Ala|rum, came dovvn to the Shoar in great numbers, in&s;omuch that <HI>Drake</HI> thought it no vvays convenient to land there: And that his Pinnaces might be the better manned, he cau&s;ed his great Ship to be &s;unk, after all things nece&s;&s;ary vvere taken out of her, and &s;ailed from that Port, ly|ing for &s;ome time undi&s;covered, about a League thence, and cau&s;ed the Negroes to build Hou&s;es, to &s;helter his Men from the violent Storms of Rain that fell during his &s;tay: To vvhich place the <HI>Indians</HI> brought &s;tore of Water and Victuals, for vvhich they vvere amply gratified. At vvhich
<PB N="4" REF="3"> place leaving one Ship, he, with the two Pinnaces, &s;ailed to <HI>Rio Grand,</HI> where roving up a great River, the Marriners were much afflicted with the in&s;ufferable &s;tinging of Flyes, called <HI>Muskatos,</HI> again&s;t which there is no Remedy, but Juice of Lemons, with which the Skin being wet, they will not fa&s;ten. In the River he met two <HI>Indian Canows,</HI> in which were Fi&s;her-men, but took no notice of them, for fear of being di&s;co|ver'd, but pa&s;&s;ing for Spaniards, the Captain and his Men came to a Store-hou&s;e on the River-&s;ide, where they found great plenty of Provi&s;ion, pre|pared for the Fleet that was to return into <HI>Spain;</HI> after which, having notice that the Spaniards were coming down, they returned to their Pinnaces, and &s;oon after took five or &s;ix &s;mall Barks laden with Provi|&s;ion, &s;etting the Men on Shoar, and &s;o &s;ailed to the Country of the Sy|merons, who kindly received them. The&s;e Symerons are a People inha|biting between <HI>Cabezas,</HI> and <HI>Rio-piego,</HI> who by certain Negroes, were given to under&s;tand, That <HI>Drake</HI> came as a Friend, and would protect them again&s;t the Attemps of the Spaniards; which cau&s;ed them to ad|mit the Engli&s;h to confer with them, and furni&s;h them with &s;uch Ne|ce&s;&s;aries as they required; promi&s;ing <HI>Drake,</HI> that as &s;oon as the five rainy Months were pa&s;t, in which the Spaniards never carry their Trea&s;ure by Land, they would &s;o order the matter, that he &s;hould make him&s;elf Ma&s;ter of much Gold. Whereupon he ordered them to build him &s;ix Hou&s;es, for &s;heltering his Men, which they did, as likewi&s;e with the help of the Engli&s;h a Fort Triangle, which the Captain fortifyed to prevent any Surprize; and leaving part of his Men there, &s;ailed a|mong&s;t the plea&s;ant I&s;lands, in the River repleni&s;hed with Gardens, and delicious Fruits, where the Indians were at his Devotion, deli|vering up their Bows and Arrows, bringing Baskets of Fruit and Jui|ces of Bails, as an Oblation of the&s;e People. <HI>Drake</HI> inquired into the State of the Country, and then &s;ailed towards <HI>Chare&s;ha,</HI> and anchored between the I&s;land, and the Main-land to defend which, the Spaniards had lined the Shoar vvith Shot, firing ince&s;&s;antly at the Engli&s;h, &s;o that they vvere oblig'd to &s;tand off, the Captain having one of his Men &s;ore wounded; and next Morning took a Bark laden with Provi&s;ion and Sweet-meats, bound for <HI>Cartagena,</HI> &s;etting all the Men on Shoar, ex|cept a Negro, whom the Captain kept, to be by him in&s;tructed in the Affairs of the Country; and anchoring at the Mouth of the <HI>Haven</HI> of <HI>Cartagena,</HI> took two other Barks, which cau&s;ed the Spaniards to &s;end a <HI>Scrivaneo</HI> with a Flag of Truce, who de&s;ired to be admitted on Board, which was accordingly granted; But <HI>Drake</HI> finding his Me&s;&s;age was on|ly
<PB N="5" REF="3"> to protract time, till the Forces came down to &s;urprize him, would not accept of his Invitation on Shoar, which Treachery was &s;oon ap|parent. For the Spaniards perceiving <HI>Drake</HI>'s Warine&s;s, and that they could not get him within their reach by Land, &s;ent two Ships of War to fight him by Sea, which he perceiving, went joyfully to encounter them: But after the exchange of &s;everal &s;hot, the Spaniards finding their Entertainment too warm, put them&s;elves under the Protection of the Ca&s;tle, and &s;oon after came two other Pinnaces, who fared no better than the former: Whereupon <HI>Drake</HI> landed &s;everal of his Men, and drove the Spaniards from the Shoar, and for their Safety, to betake them&s;elves &s;ome to the Town, and others to a thick Wood &s;tanding clo&s;e by; but Victuals growing &s;carce, he was obliged to &s;tand away to <HI>Rio Grand,</HI> where a little before he had found &s;tore of Provi&s;ion, but now was fru&s;trated in his Expectation, for the Spaniards had cau&s;ed the Na|tives to retire to the Mountains, and carry away with them all their Cattle, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> But at length meeting with &s;everal &s;mall Ve&s;&s;els which he took, their Want was in &s;ome Mea&s;ure &s;upplyed, yet the Scarcity cau&s;ed a Sickne&s;s to rage among the Marriners, but providence &s;o or|dered it, that only one of them dyed.</P>
<P>The Sickne&s;s ended, <HI>Drake</HI> returned to the Fort, vvhere he had left part of his Men, together vvith the Symerons; but upon his arrival; to his great Grief, found his Brother, and one <HI>Richard Allen,</HI> dead of the Wounds they received in attempting to Board a Spani&s;h Ship of con&s;iderable Force. Nor was this all the Lo&s;s, for <HI>Jo&s;eph Drake,</HI> ano|ther of the Captains Brothers, &s;oon after dyed of a Calenture; yet he took Courage, and being &s;upplyed by the Symerons, he attended his better Fortune, and vvas &s;oon after informed by tho&s;e People (vvho like Grey-hounds ranged the Country to learn vvhat they could) that the Spani&s;h Fleet vvas arrived at <HI>Nombre de Dios;</HI> vvhereupon <HI>Drake</HI> &s;ent the <HI>Lyon</HI> Frigat to de&s;cry them, vvho upon her approaching that Port fell in vvith a &s;mall Spani&s;h Ve&s;&s;el laden vvith Mace, Hens, and Pompi|ons, from <HI>Tolon.</HI> The Spaniards that vvere found therein, the Captain u&s;ed courteou&s;ly, protecting them from the Fury of the Symerons, vvho are mortal Enemies to the Spaniards.</P>
<P>Upon certain notice that the Fleet vvas arrived, <HI>Drake</HI> conferred vvith the native Symerons, about the Nece&s;&s;aries that vvere to be provi|ded for the Expedition, to &s;urprize &s;uch Carriages of Gold and Sil|ver, as vvere to come over Land; vvho told him he mu&s;t be vvell fur|ni&s;hed vvith Weapons and Shooes, and that for the re&s;t they would not
<PB N="6" REF="4"> be wanting; which being provided, 48 Men &s;et forward, of which, 30 were Symerons, and the re&s;t Engli&s;h; the former &s;erving in&s;tead of Sumpeteres for carrying Provi&s;ion, and when the &s;tore failed, they would range the Woods, and catch &s;uch Provi&s;ion as they could, &s;el|dom mi&s;&s;ing to return without a Buck or Faun, or &s;tore of Foul, bear|ing about them many Arrows, headed with Iron, Wood, or Fi&s;hes Bones; which they will ca&s;t &s;o dexterou&s;ly, that they &s;eldom mi&s;s the Iron, with which their Arrows are headed, and is frequently found to be more precious in their E&s;timation than Gold.</P>
<P>This March they continued over Land through many thick Woods, from Sun-ri&s;e, till ten in the Morning, and then re&s;ting in watery plaaes till four in the Afternoon, they walked till eight; and when Darkne&s;s came on, the Symerons laying a&s;ide their Burthens, would cut down Boughs to build Harbours with, covering them to keep out the Rain, if any &s;hould fall, building them with <HI>Planata</HI> Leaves, decent|wi&s;e according to the Fa&s;hion of <HI>Norway</HI> Cottages; in&s;omuch that no Rain would enter for the &s;pace of 24 Hours; nor were they wanting to bring &s;everal &s;orts of Fruits, as <HI>Mammeas, Guyanas, Palmitos, Pinos, Oranges, Lemons,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>After three Days travel, they came to a Town of Symerons, &s;ituate on a Hill near a River, compo&s;ed with a Dike of eight Foot broad, and a thick Mud-wall ten Foot in height, containing one broad Street from Ea&s;t to We&s;t, and two cro&s;s Streets of a le&s;&s;er breadth; all con|&s;i&s;ting of &s;ixty Families, who in their Apparel, &s;omewhat imitated the Spaniards: This Town is di&s;tant from <HI>Nombre de Dios</HI> 35 Leagues, and 45 from <HI>Panama,</HI> being &s;ufficiently &s;tored with all manner of Plenty. As for their Religion, they have no Prie&s;ts, yet they hold Cro&s;&s;es in great Veneration; but at the Per&s;wa&s;ion of the Engli&s;h they laid their Cro&s;&s;es a&s;ide, and in &s;ome mea&s;ure embrace the Wor&s;hip of the true God, learning the <HI>Lord's-Prayer,</HI> and many other nece&s;&s;ary Articles of Belief; they continually were upon their Guard, for fear of the Spaniards, who daily mole&s;ted them, aiming at the Subver&s;ion of that Place, on which they made &s;everal Attempts, but without Succe&s;s, their Scouts upon the Frontiers continually giving notice of their approach, and &s;o alarumed their neighbouring Towns, e&s;pecial|ly that wherein the King re&s;ided, in which were &s;uppo&s;ed to be 1700 fighting Men; and fain would they have entreated the Captain to a long|er Re&s;idence among&s;t them, but he being intent on his Journey, with many Expre&s;&s;ions of Kindne&s;s took his leave, and &s;o marching with
<PB N="7" REF="4"> four Symerons, who knew the way about a Mile before him, who by breaking off Boughs, and &s;trewing them in the way, gave Directions; and the other twenty four divided equally for his Vaunt-guard, and Rear-guard, the Engli&s;h continuing in the middle. After pa&s;&s;ing ma|ny gloomy Woods, which &s;helter'd them from the Sun's hot Beams, they came to a great Hill, on which &s;tood a high Tree, in which were cut &s;everal Steps, that led to a plea&s;ant Bower, &s;ituate on the top, in which, ten or twelve Men might &s;it, and from thence take a View of the North and South <HI>Atlantick</HI> Ocean; and from thence they pa&s;&s;ed on to a plain Champain Country, abounding in Gra&s;s &s;o high, that the Inhabitants are obliged to burn it twice or thrice a Year, to give their Cattle advantage of feeding; through which they travel|led to <HI>Panama,</HI> and for fear of being di&s;covered, &s;truck through a gloomy Grove, on the right Hand, and at the Edge thereof re&s;ting, they &s;ent a Symeron di&s;gui&s;ed like a Negro, to <HI>Panama,</HI> to enquire what Night, for by Day they travelled not, by rea&s;on of the heat of the Sun, the <HI>Recoes</HI> pa&s;&s;ed to <HI>Venta Cruz,</HI> in order to their Pa&s;&s;age to <HI>Nombre de Dios,</HI> to land the Fleet, and by him, upon his return had notice, That that Night eight Mules laden with Gold and Silver, and one with Jewels, together with fifty others laden with Provi&s;ions and Merchandize, were to pa&s;s the Road; whereupon <HI>Drake,</HI> with his Men, and the Symerons, placed them&s;elves in the Gra&s;s, and thick Shrubs, near to the Way-&s;ide, in expectation of the rich Booty: The Truth of which was likewi&s;e confirmed by a Spani&s;h Soldier, taken by two Symerons, and brought to the Captain; and &s;o placed them|&s;elves, that whil&s;t one Party was &s;eizing on the foremo&s;t Mules, the other might take the hinder-mo&s;t. And all things had &s;ucceeded to their Wi&s;h, had not an Engli&s;h Man and a Symeron, though contrary to the &s;trict Command of the Captain, &s;uddenly &s;tarted out to &s;eize a Cavalier coming from <HI>Venta-Cruz,</HI> who perceiving them by the Eng|li&s;h Man's white Shirt, which he and the re&s;t had put over his Cloaths, the better to di&s;tingui&s;h them if it &s;hould come to a Skirmi&s;h, as in all likelyhood it would, he &s;uddenly put Spurs to his Hor&s;e, and out|&s;tripped them; about a League di&s;tance meeting with the <HI>Recoes,</HI> he informed the Conveyors of what he had &s;een, tell ng them, that he was &s;ure that either <HI>Drake,</HI> or &s;ome of his Men, lay in Ambu&s;h for them; So the <HI>Reooes,</HI> laden with Gold and Silver, and Jewels, turned back again, only that laden with Provi&s;ion, Merchandize, and a &s;mall quantity of Trea&s;ure, come forward, which was accordingly taken,
<PB N="8" REF="5"> and declared the manner of the Prevention; imploring <HI>Drake</HI> to de|fend them from the Rage of the Symerons.</P>
<P>Matters being at this pa&s;s, it was not thought &s;afe to &s;tay in tho&s;e parts, but to return to their Ships, which they could not do, but by the tedious way they came, or by cutting their way through <HI>Venta-cruz,</HI> the latter of which was le&s;s difficult, <HI>Drake</HI> re&s;olved on, and therefore com|manding his Men to refre&s;h them&s;elves, asked <HI>Pedro,</HI> Captain of the Sy|merons, whether he would &s;tand by him or no? Who an&s;wered, he would dye at his Feet, e're he would leave him; and thereupon on they marched till they came near the Town, and there taking out of the Re|coes what was be&s;t Portable, they turned back the Mules and their Dri|vers, commanding them on pain of Death, not to follow them; and cen|tering the way, cut through a thick Wood, as thick as our Engli&s;h Hedges, they were encountered by a Company of Spaniards, under the leading of a Convent Fryer; when after a hot Skirmi&s;h (in which <HI>John Harris,</HI> an Engli&s;h Man, and one <HI>Symeron</HI> were killed) the Spaniards were put to Flight, many of them being killed, wounded, and taken Pri&s;oners; the Symerons at that time behaving them&s;elves valiantly, doing with their Arrows great Execution. But far they had not marched e're the Spani|ards, who had retired, being reinforced, had fortify'd them&s;elves in a Wood, by which the Engli&s;h mu&s;t pa&s;s; into which Wood the Symerons in a dancing Po&s;ture ru&s;hed, &s;inging in their Tone, <HI>Yo-peho, Yo-peho,</HI> and with their Arrows drove the poor <HI>Spaniards</HI> thence, with the lo&s;s of but one Man; who, wounded as he was, e're he dyed, killed two Spa|niards.</P>
<P>The Out-guards beaten, tho&s;e that remained in the Town made but &s;mall Re&s;i&s;tance, &s;o that the Engli&s;h and Symerons entring, found mo&s;t of their Hou&s;es abandoned. This Town of <HI>Venta-cruz,</HI> con&s;i&s;ts not of above fifty Hou&s;es, be&s;ides one Mona&s;tery, and a few Store-hou&s;es. Here likewi&s;e they found three Spani&s;h Gentlewomen that had lately been delivered of Children came &s;ome Days before from <HI>Nombre de Dios;</HI> for that it had been ob&s;erved, that no Spaniard, or White, had e|ver been delivered at the latter place, but that the Child &s;oon after dy|ed: But that being brought to Bed at <HI>Venta-cruz,</HI> or any other place adjacent, the Children came to Maturity. In Compa&s;&s;ion of this, <HI>Drake</HI> &s;trictly commanded, that neither his own Men or the Symerons, &s;hould Out-rage them: And &s;o having &s;et a Guard upon all the Pa&s;&s;es, they took &s;ome &s;mall Pillage and departed, having fir&s;t beaten back twelve Hor&s;e-men, who &s;uppo&s;ing them gome, came thither from <HI>Panama.</HI></P>
<PB N="9" REF="5">
<P>Thus the chief Ends, for which the Journey was undertaken, being unluckily fru&s;trated, <HI>Drake</HI> (after a tedious March, in which many of his Men had peri&s;hed by Hunger and Thir&s;t, had not the Symerons pro|ved their Purveyors) arrived to his Ships; tho&s;e on Board, who before were in great Heavine&s;s for his Ab&s;ence, abundantly rejoycing at his return; and &s;o &s;taying on Board in the River <HI>Fortugos,</HI> for &s;ome time a Con&s;ult was held, what Enterprize was next to be undertaken; in which the Opinion of the Symerons was held nece&s;&s;ary, as they who be&s;t knew the Country, and where the Trea&s;ure lay; who gave Council, that near a Town called <HI>Varagna,</HI> lived one <HI>Senior Pezero,</HI> who had for|merly been Ma&s;ter to &s;ome of them, and whom for his Cruelty they had abandoned; and that this Man, in a &s;trong Store-hou&s;e, guarded by a 100 Slaves, had heaped up great Trea&s;ure, being Proprietor of &s;everal rich Mines. This Advice plea&s;ed them, yet they were prevented at that time by another Advice; for one of the Frigats being abroad, had taken a &s;mall Spani&s;h Prize, in which was a <HI>Genoway</HI> Pilot; the &s;aid Pilot, upon his being kindly entreated, informed <HI>Drake,</HI> that in the <HI>Bay</HI> of <HI>Vicarague,</HI> lay a Ve&s;&s;el ready to depart, in which was a Million of Gold, and that by his Knowledge of the Channel, if he might partake in the Gains, he could bring him in undi&s;covered, and that he might have time to di&s;patch his bu&s;ine&s;s, e're the Town could be allarum'd. Whereupon the Captain giving &s;uch of the Symerons (who were willing thereto) leave to depart, giving them many large Gifts, he took the re&s;t with their Captain on Board, and &s;et &s;ail on this &s;o-much-de&s;ired Prize; but entering the Harbour, altho' it was not yet dark, he under|&s;tood by the firing of &s;everal Chambers, which were an&s;wered by others a di&s;tance thence, that he was di&s;covered, and the Wind turning again&s;t him, he thought it not fit to attempt any thing further in the matter. So returning to his Station, he met the <HI>Bear</HI> Frigat, a &s;mall Ve&s;&s;ell that he had fitted up, who had taken a Spani&s;h Bark, laden with twenty fat Hogs, two hundred Hens, and great &s;tore of Mace; which is a kind of Grain like Rice, and in it ten Spaniards, who informed him, that the Fleet was arrived at <HI>Nombre de Dios,</HI> and that two Gallies were building there to waft them to and fro, but not yet lanced. Whereupon <HI>Drake</HI> fea&s;ting his Men in this manner on <HI>Ea&s;ter-day,</HI> which that Year fell on the twentieth of <HI>March,</HI> he re&s;olved to attempt &s;omething on the Fleet, and weighing Anchor, bore with the Wind, till at length they e&s;pyed a &s;mall Ve&s;&s;el plying to the We&s;t-ward, which after &s;ome &s;ailing. was di&s;cryed to be a French Ve&s;&s;el; who&s;e Captain likewi&s;e &s;uppo&s;ing
<PB N="10" REF="6"> it was <HI>Drake,</HI> &s;tood with him, and in a mo&s;t &s;ubm&s;&s;ive manner, he beg|ged &s;ome fre&s;h Water, for that he had nothing but Wine and Cider on Board; the which, by rea&s;on of the hot Weather, had much impaired the Health of his Men with which <HI>Drake</HI> &s;upplyed him, willing to &s;tand with him to the next Port, which he accordingly did, making him there a Pre&s;ent of a Ca&s;e of Pi&s;tols, and a Gilt Scimeter, which he &s;aid had been the late King of <HI>France</HI>'s, who was killed in Ju&s;t with <HI>Moun|&s;ieur de Gomery;</HI> in requital of which, <HI>Drake</HI> gave him a Chain of Gold, and a further Supply of nece&s;&s;ary Provi&s;ion. So that in the end he was willing to accompany him in his Voyage and take &s;uch part as &s;hould befal him; yet <HI>Drake</HI> not altogether &s;atisfied in his Fidelity, &s;o divided either Nation, that it was not in the Power of the <HI>French</HI> Men, if they would, to have injured the Engli&s;h; and then &s;ending for the Symeron Captain, he approved of what was done, and thereupon it was agreed, that twenty French, fifteen Engli&s;h, and a con&s;iderable number of Sy|merons, &s;hould pa&s;s over Land, to intercept the Ricoes that were com|ing from <HI>Panama,</HI> to <HI>Nombre de Dios,</HI> when having gone &s;even Leagues, the Bells of the Camels and Mules were heard, which made the Syme|rons rejoyce, a&s;&s;uring Capt. <HI>Drake,</HI> that he &s;hould have more Gold and Silver, than he could di&s;po&s;e of; and &s;o indeed it fortuned, for the Ricoes being &s;eized, a rich Booty appeared; but there being a Guard of forty Spaniards attending it, a hot Di&s;pute hapned; but in the end, the Spaniards were put to Flight, and the Gold and Silver unladed, and every one took what he could conveniently carry; but &s;carce had they hid the re&s;t, and entered the Wood, e're a great number of Hor&s;e and Foot came on, yet they kept their way, all e&s;caping, except on Syme|ron that was killed, and a French Soldier that was taken Pri&s;oner, who being put to the Torture, confe&s;&s;ed where the Gold was hid; in the Conflict the French Captain was dangerou&s;ly wounded: But what was mo&s;t amazing, was, that when they came to the Sea-&s;ide, where the Pinnaces had order to attend them, they perceived &s;even Spani&s;h Pin|naces, which were &s;ent to take the Engli&s;h Ve&s;&s;els, then but weakly manned, whom <HI>Drake</HI> and the re&s;t imagined to have executed their De|&s;ign; but taking Courge, he re&s;olved to make a Raft of &s;uch Trees as were driven on Shoor, and put to Sea, in order to &s;eek his Ve&s;&s;els, which he accordingly put in practice, accompanied with one Engli&s;h Man, two French Men, and two Symerons, with a great joy found the Ve&s;&s;els &s;afe, riding it out behind the Point and in &s;pite of the Spaniards, ac|cording to his Promi&s;e, fetched o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="3 letters"> his Companions, when having re|fre&s;hed
<PB N="11" REF="6"> them&s;elves, they went to look for the hidden Trea&s;ure, but found as afore&s;aid, that the Spaniards, by the French Captain's Confe&s;&s;i|on, had di&s;covered it. Yet had they not &s;earched &s;o narrowly, but that they had left &s;everal Bars of Silver behind them, as al&s;o &s;ome Quo|its of Gold; but what troubled the French Men mo&s;t, their Captain &s;ore wounded as he was, fell into the Hands of the Spaniards, yet upon &s;haring the Booty equally among&s;t them and the Engli&s;h, they were comforted, e&s;pecially upon the Arrival of one of their Companions, who had e&s;caped the Hands of the Spaniards. Yet being de&s;irous to depart into their own Country, they left the Engli&s;h, yet fearing the Danger they might incur, by falling into the Hands of the Spaniards, they repented their Ra&s;hne&s;s, and lingered till <HI>Drake</HI> overtook them: When notice being had that the Spani&s;h Fleet richly laden were about to depart from <HI>Carthagena, Drake</HI> &s;ailed to the Mouth of the Harbour, and there dropping his Anchor, braved them with all Streamers flying, and Flag a&s;tern, and took a Frigat of fifty Tuns, laden with Provi&s;ion, within &s;ight of 'em, and not to be cumbered with the Men taken there|in, &s;et them on Shoar, and &s;o without longer &s;tay &s;ailed to <HI>Cabezas,</HI> ha|ving fir&s;t burnt the Ship, that it might no more advantage the Spaniards.</P>
<P>During <HI>Drake</HI>'s Stay at <HI>Cabezas, Pedro,</HI> the Captain of the Symerons, importun'd him for certain Iron In&s;truments belonging to Navigation, which he frankly gave him for the good Service he had done for him: further promi&s;ing that he would look out &s;ome Silk and Linnen for his Wife, not intending to hold any thing from him that he could conve|niently &s;pare. But whil&s;t he was looking in his Che&s;t, the <HI>Indian</HI> e&s;pyed the Scimeter, given him by the French Captain, and was greatly de&s;i|rous of it, but being ba&s;hful him&s;elf, he gave another a Quoit of Gold to ask for it; and having his Reque&s;t granted, he gave <HI>Drake</HI> four Quo|its of Gold in requital, &s;aying, He would pre&s;ent it to his King, who would highly promote him for &s;uch a Pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>And now <HI>Drake</HI> being de&s;irous to return into <HI>England,</HI> rewarded the <HI>Symerons</HI> with divers Giefts, and after leave taken, tho' to the great Grief of tho&s;e <HI>Indians,</HI> who earne&s;tly de&s;ired the Company of the <HI>Eng|li&s;h,</HI> they &s;tood away to the I&s;land that be&s;pangled the Ocean, and coa&s;t|ing that Tract, came to the Cape St. <HI>Anthony,</HI> where they took two hundred and fifty Turtles, which they powdered and eat, as occa&s;ion required; and from thence &s;ailing North-we&s;t, after touching at &s;eve|ral places, they, to the great Joy of their Friends, who concluded them lo&s;t, arrived &s;afe at <HI>Plymouth,</HI> on the 9th Day of <HI>June,</HI> 1573, bringing

<P>The&s;e Ve&s;&s;els being manned with 164 able Seamen, and Soldiers, and furni&s;hed with all things nece&s;&s;ary, &s;ailed out of <HI>Plymouth</HI> Road on the 15th of <HI>November,</HI> 1577; yet met with many Difficulties, by rea&s;on of Tempe&s;ts, and contrary Winds, e're they could get clear of the Land's End; at what time &s;ailing towards the Coa&s;t of <HI>Barbary,</HI> they came to an Anchor on the Coa&s;t of <HI>Magadore,</HI> lying three Degrees, forty Minutes, being part of the Territories of the King of <HI>Fez,</HI> being a &s;mall I&s;land not above three Leagues in Cir|cumference, abounding with Foul and Fi&s;h, though of an unu&s;ual Shape. There &s;ome of the Engli&s;h going on Shoar, the Negroes, who inhabit that place, were de&s;irous to be conducted on board, for who&s;e Security <HI>Drake</HI> left a Pledge on &s;hoar, the Moors &s;eemingly de&s;iring to Traffick for &s;uch Commodities as the Engli&s;h had, bring|ing to the Sea-&s;ide, Camels laden with Merchandizes.

<P>Departing from this I&s;land, <HI>Drake</HI> took a &s;mall <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Fi&s;her-boat conducted but with three Men only; and after that, &s;ailing under the <HI>Tropick Cancer,</HI> fell in with a Spani&s;h Caravel, which he took, and then &s;ailing to <HI>Cape Barbas,</HI> he there took another, though indiffe|rently laden with Provi&s;ion; where having plenty of all things nece&s;|&s;ary, he &s;tayed a while, during which &s;pace, the Natives came down to view the Engli&s;h, bringing with them a <HI>Negro</HI> Woman half &s;tarved, with a Child at her Brea&s;t, offering her to &s;ale, but <HI>Drake</HI> would not traffick for &s;uch Commodities; whereupon they brought Gums, and Amber-gree&s;e, offering it for fre&s;h Water, which above all things is mo&s;t &s;carce in that Country. Water they had, but <HI>Drake</HI> would not take any thing for the common Element, as like|wi&s;e &s;ome Provi&s;ion, for which they were very thankful for, eating greedily.</P>
<P>Having thus far proceeded, they &s;et the Spaniards on Shoar, and after trimming their Ship, &s;ailed to <HI>Cape de Verde,</HI> and &s;o coa&s;ted <HI>Bomavi&s;ta,</HI> falling in with the <HI>I&s;le of Mayo,</HI> inhabited by the <HI>Portu|gue&s;e,</HI> and &s;o touching at &s;everal I&s;lands, came to St. <HI>Jago,</HI> on the South-We&s;t of which I&s;land, they took a <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> Ve&s;&s;el, laden with Wine, Woollen, and Linnen-Cloath, on its return from <HI>Bra|zil,</HI> and in Defiance of tho&s;e on Land, fired <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">pon three or four of their Towns, &s;tanding on the Sea-coa&s;t.</P>

<P>From this I&s;land, after having taken &s;ome of what it afforded, they &s;tood away to the Coa&s;t of <HI>Brazil,</HI> but by contrary Winds were kept out &s;o long at Sea, that Provi&s;ion grew &s;canty, and e&s;pe|cially Water, which in that burning Climate was mo&s;t requi&s;ite.

<P>Upon their landing the People fled, they entred a homely Hou&s;e near a Rock, where they found fifty E&s;triches of a Prodigious &s;ize, who&s;e Weight were &s;uch, that they could not fly, but run as fa&s;t as Grey|hounds, &s;o that they are not catched, but by decoying them into a Net, by the likene&s;s of an E&s;trich made of their Feathers. <HI>Drake</HI> not find|ing this Harbour for his Purpo&s;e, &s;tood away South-we&s;t, about twelve Leagues, where entering a Port, a great number of the Natives pre|&s;ented them&s;elves upon a Hill, leaping and dancing after an extrava|gant manner, and at fir&s;t landing &s;eemed fearful of the Engli&s;h, but &s;oon

<P>Sailing from thence one Degree, North Latitude, they met with a Ship laden with Linnen, and China Di&s;hes; and be&s;ides found in it a <HI>Paulcon,</HI> with a great Emrald in its Brea&s;t, which they took, and &s;o pa&s;&s;ed by the Port of <HI>Papagaia,</HI> and divers dangerous Gulphs, conti|nually &s;ending forth violent Winds.

<PB N="18" REF="10"> inhabited by the Spaniards, they furni&s;hed them with all things nece&s;&s;ary, and compounded for their Safety, with a Pot of <HI>Riats,</HI> as big as a b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;hel, a Gold Chain, and a Jewel, whence &s;ailing 500 Leagues, they came under &s;ixty Degrees North Latitude, where, al|though it was about the middle of <HI>June,</HI> they were &s;o afflicted with Cold. that they were obliged to ha&s;te thence, to &s;ave their Lives, all the Countries round being covered with Snow, and the Seas with Globes of Ice; &s;o that &s;ailing South-ward to thirty eight Degrees, the Weather was very temperate, where bearing with the Land, the Natives &s;ent a Man in a Cannow, to invite them on &s;hoar, who made a long Oration in his own Country Language, and by his Ge&s;tures, expre&s;&s;ed his meaning, and being di&s;mi&s;&s;ed, he came again; and the third time bringing Pre&s;ents of E&s;trich Feathers, which none but tho&s;e about their Kingdom are &s;uffered to wear, he brought al&s;o a basket filled with Herbs, called <HI>Taback,</HI> in Requital of which, <HI>Drake</HI> preffered him many things, but he would receive nothing but a Hat.</P>
<P>Upon this Invitation <HI>Drake</HI> put to &s;hoar, and landed his Men, e|rected a Tent, and armed it well, to prevent any Danger, if the Natives &s;hould prove Treacherous, who no &s;ooner perceiving the Eng|li&s;h come forth of their Ships, but they came down with great ha&s;te from the Hill, and fell down at their Feet, wor&s;hipping them as Gods, throwing away their Bows and Arrows, and made many Laments and Cries.</P>
<P>The&s;e People <HI>Drake</HI> treated courteou&s;ly, be&s;towing &s;hirts, and o|ther things upon them, wherewith to cover their Nakedne&s;s; &s;ignify|ing unto them, that he was but a Man, and that all his Company were Mortals, and no Gods, as the&s;e poor deluded People &s;uppo&s;ed them to be; to the belief of which they could hardly per&s;wade them. In Recompence of what they had received, they be&s;towed upon the Eng|li&s;h Bows, Quivers of their Arrows, and the like; and &s;o with Joy, which they expre&s;&s;ed by their leaping and Dancing, they departed to their Hou&s;es, which they digged round into the Earth, having Che&s;ts of Wood &s;et up, and joyned clo&s;e at the top like a Spire, without Chim|neys. Their Door is like an ordinary Scuttle in a Ship, &s;loap wi&s;e; their Men for the mo&s;t part go naked, being of a loving and tractable Nature: their only Weapons are Bows and Arrows, with which, though they are Skilful, they do but little Execution, they being of no Force: Their Women make them&s;elves loo&s;e Garments of bulru&s;h|es, to cover their Secrets, wearing on their Shoulders bea&s;ts skins, be|ing altogether obedient to their Husbands.</P>
<PB N="19" REF="10">
<P>Two Days after, a great Multitude of them came down to the Tent, leaving their Women and bows &s;ome di&s;tance behind them, upon a Hill; who as &s;oon as they were arrived at the Tent, fell to &s;cratch|ing their Faces, and ca&s;ting them&s;elves upon the Ground, with lamen|table cries, as they u&s;e to do when they offer Sacrifice to their Gods, not being yet per&s;waded but that the Engli&s;h were &s;uch, though <HI>Drake</HI> and his Company, endeavoured to undeceive them, with pointing to|wards Heaven, Praying, and &s;inging P&s;alms.</P>
<P>Three Days after their King came down, attended by a great number, who &s;ung in a lamentable Tone about him; before him one bore a Scepter, made of black Wood, about a yard and half long, whereon hanged three Crowns, two Chains, and a bag of Herbs, called <HI>Tabak;</HI> the King had on a Caul of Net-work, re|&s;embling a Crown on his Shoulders, and his Wa&s;te a Coat of Coney-skins; his Guards had Coats of other Skins, and Cauls with Feathers in them, of divers Colours, or covers with down, which grroweth on a Herb like a Lettice, which Down is not permitted to be worn, but by tho&s;e about the King, the Seed of it is only u&s;ed in Sacrifice to their Gods. The common &s;ort were for the mo&s;t part naked, with long Hair, tyed with bunches of Feathers, every one having their Faces painted. La&s;tly, The Women came with Baskets on their Arms, made of Ru&s;hes, &s;o clo&s;ely Woven, that they would hold Water, being hanged with Pearl-&s;hells, and other &s;hells, and with two or three links of a Chain, &s;ignifying they were Ve&s;&s;els dedicated to their Gods. He that bore the Scepter, made an Oration for the &s;pace of half an hour, which ended with a general <HI>Amen,</HI> and all (&s;ave the Children) came down the Hill.</P>
<P>Being come near, he that bore the Scepter, with a &s;tately Carri|age began a Song, and a Dance, as al&s;o did the King and all the re&s;t (&s;ave the Women) who daunced, but did not &s;ing. Which ended, they entered the Tent, where the King cau&s;ed his Crown to be &s;et upon <HI>Drake</HI>'s Head, de&s;iring him, which by many Signs he made to take upon him the Kingdom, &s;aluting him by the Name of <HI>Hyoh,</HI> ending the Solemnity with a Song and a Dance, which <HI>Drake</HI> received, to the behoof of her Maje&s;ty. When as the Com|mon People leaving the King with <HI>Drake,</HI> went among&s;t the re&s;t of the Engli&s;h, and finding &s;uch as plea&s;ed their Fancies, which were commonly the Younge&s;t, and mo&s;t beautiful, they inclo&s;ed them
<PB N="20" REF="11"> round, and offered Sacrifices to them, crying with lamentable Shricks, weeping, &s;cratching, and tearing their Fle&s;h from off their Faces.</P>

<P>From this Country they &s;ailed to the I&s;lands of <HI>Molacos,</HI> where the Inhabitants in their <HI>Canows,</HI> under Pretence of Trafficking with them, &s;ought to &s;urprize them, but &s;oon found to their Smart, that <HI>Drake</HI> came not to that end; whereupon naming it the <HI>I&s;le of Thieves,</HI> they &s;tood away to <HI>Tatnate,</HI> where the King of that Country &s;ent his Deputy to intreat them to come on Shoar, whereupon <HI>Drake</HI> ca&s;t Anchor, and &s;ent a Me&s;&s;enger to the King with a Scarlet Cloak, de&s;iring that he might be &s;upplyed with Provi&s;ion, and other Nece&s;&s;aries; who returned An&s;wer by his <HI>Vice-Roy,</HI> that he would do any thing to &s;erve them, and that he would &s;hortly vi&s;it them at their Ships, who accordingly came in his <HI>Canow,</HI> attended by &s;everal of the Nobility, cloathed in <HI>White Calico.</HI> When as the King did Obey&s;ance in humble manner, being of a tall Stature, Corpulent, and of a Princely Countenance; his Re&s;pect among&s;t his Subjects was very great, none of his Attendants daring to &s;peak to him but on their Knees; he was received on Board with Drums beating, Trumpets &s;ounding, and Vollies of great and &s;mall Shot: his Attire from his Wa&s;t downwards, was Cloath of Gold, his Legs bare, on his Feet Shooes of <HI>Red Cordivant:</HI> on his Cap were divers Rings of Plated Gold, an Inch and half broad about his Neck, and on his right Hand Rings, &s;et with rich Stones. After he had been treated and welcomed, he returned to Shoar, and &s;ent &s;tore of Provi&s;ion, for which tho&s;e that brought it, received good Pre&s;ents: He &s;ent one of his Brothers the next Day, to invite <HI>Drake</HI> to his Palace, but &s;ome Su&s;pition ari&s;ing, by words let fall, he would not go, but &s;ent &s;ome of his Gentlemen, detaining the <HI>Vice-Roy</HI> as a Pledge of their &s;afety, who upon their Arrival were honourably received.

<P>The Country thus allarumed, the Spaniards in great numbers run to their Arms, but dur&s;t attempt nothing; &s;o that the General com|manded <HI>Praje</HI> to be burnt, which &s;o perplexed the Spaniards, that they re&s;olved to compound for <HI>Domingo,</HI> and St. <HI>Jago;</HI> but whil&s;t the Treaty was in hand, the Engli&s;h had withdrawn them&s;elves out of <HI>Do|mingo,</HI> the Spaniards fortifyed it, planting Canons in the Gate, and laying an Ambu&s;cade.

Moreover, the Spaniards had drawn two Gallies into the Harbour, into which, they had put one Ordinance, and 400 &s;mall &s;hot, and on the Land-&s;ide 300 Men &s;tood armed with Pikes: but the Engli&s;h taking the lower ground, con&s;trained them to flight, and did not Fire till they came up to the Wall, when letting fly a Volly in the Faces of the Spaniards, and &s;econding it with the Butt-end of their Muskets, they beat them fir&s;t from their Baracadoes, and &s;econdly, cau&s;ed them to fly, entering the the Town Pell-mell with them: and obtaining the Market Place planting there a &s;trong Guard, notwith&s;tanding they had Baraca|doed every &s;treet, &s;et Indians with Poy&s;oned Arrows at each cor|ner, and &s;tuck up poy&s;oned &s;ticks, with &s;harp points to di&s;able the Soldiers.</P>
