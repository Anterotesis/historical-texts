<P><HI>_AS</HI> often as I contemplate the good Order and <HI>Di&s;cipline</HI> of the old <HI>Roman Mili|tia</HI> (whereby that <HI>Queen of Cities</HI> be|came <HI>Lady</HI> of the world) comparing it with ours, it &s;eems to me as if the fa|mous <HI>Manlii,</HI> the <HI>Fabii,</HI> and the <HI>Sci|pio</HI>'s, were revived again among the gallant Commanders and Captains of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Nation; For, without controver&s;ie, tho&s;e antient <HI>Heroes</HI> may here finde their <HI>Parallels</HI> in every <HI>Punctilio</HI> of true valor and honor, not any whit inferior in Civil or moral Indowments: But if to the accompli&s;hments of nature, we add tho&s;e al&s;o that are <HI>Spiritual;</HI> by how much <HI>Grace</HI> excels <HI>Na|ture,</HI> Chri&s;tian piety morality, &s;o farre we may conclude, that
<PB N="2" REF="3">as the pre&s;ent per&s;ons and Actions take their ri&s;e from mor Noble Principles and de&s;ignes, &s;o they mu&s;t needs tran&s;cend the highe&s;t examples of <HI>old Rome,</HI> and appear much more excellent, every way, than all the Monuments and Triumphs of the <HI>Roman</HI> vertue. How great then is the happine&s;s of this Nation (even in the mid&s;t of mi&s;ery) that notwith&s;tanding, through the continued Plots and malice of her Enemies, &s;he be con&s;trained &s;till to keep a <HI>Militia</HI> on foot for her nece&s;&s;ary defence, yet the matter is carried, through the care and &s;eve|rity of tho&s;e which Command, that &s;o good Order is ob&s;erved among the Soldiery, as it equals, if not exceeds the &s;tricte&s;t Patern of the <HI>Roman Di&s;cipline!</HI> Time was (you may re|member) not long &s;ince, when the poor people were wont to tremble at the very name of approaching Soldiery; Let the <HI>North</HI> con&s;ider how it was hara&s;&s;ed by the in&s;ulting <HI>Cavalier,</HI> and farre wor&s;e afterwards by the pernicious and mo&s;t merci|le&s;s <HI>Scot,</HI> who like the <HI>Locu&s;t,</HI> devoured what the <HI>Palmer|worm</HI> had left, utterly drained them of their wealth and provi&s;ions, cleared both man and bea&s;t (driving all away) to the impoveri&s;hing and &s;tarving of many <HI>Thou&s;ands,</HI> in the <HI>Northern Counties;</HI> nor did they abate one tittle of the like inhumanity, all along the Countrey, in that their memorable march (to no purpo&s;e) to the &s;iege of <HI>Hereford.</HI> Let the <HI>We&s;t</HI> likewi&s;e remember, what it &s;uffer'd by that wretched crew under <HI>Goring</HI> and <HI>Grenviel;</HI> neither let it be forgotten by the whole Land, how much every part did groan under the cruelty of <HI>Rupert,</HI> and his implacable pack of <HI>Foreiners</HI> and <HI>Plunderers;</HI> who&s;e rapacious lu&s;ts knew no mea&s;ure, nor their eyes any pity, where&s;oever they came. Nor is it po&s;&s;ible; that the <HI>Mid-land Counties</HI> and <HI>Frontiers</HI> &s;hould forget the deva&s;tations, burnings free-quarters, and plunders, made by the incur&s;ions of both the Parties, as well <HI>Parliamentary,</HI> as <HI>Royal;</HI> For in tho&s;e days, little better was the con&s;titution of many even of the <HI>Parliaments</HI> Forces, who were too much infected with the <HI>High-Boys, Dammees</HI> and <HI>Ranters;</HI> &s;o that the poor people in all parts, were ground to powder (like Corn in the mill) betwixt two di&s;agreeing Parties, who both &s;eem'd
<PB N="3" REF="3">to agree in the &s;ame point of inhumanity, to inhance the mi&s;e|ries and &s;orrows of an afflicted Kingdom.</P>
<P>But in proce&s;s of time, it &s;eeming good to the wi&s;dome of <HI>Par|liament,</HI> to alter the <HI>Commander in Chief,</HI> and e&s;tabli&s;h a <HI>new model</HI> of the <HI>Militia</HI> (as it now &s;tands to this day) e&s;peciall care was taken in the fir&s;t place to put &s;uch onely in place of Com|mand, as were men of known principles of integrity and Piety; and the whole ma&s;s of the Soldiery (e&s;pecially the <HI>Cavalry</HI>) was made up for the mo&s;t part, of men of the &s;ame temper; &s;uch as ingaged upon internal re&s;pects of Con&s;cience and duty, not out of <HI>Mercenary,</HI> or any other inferior con&s;iderations; by which means it came to pa&s;s, that the <HI>Army</HI> was &s;oon freed from all the inconveniences and extravagancies of the former e&s;ta|bli&s;hment. The noble and &s;erious behaviour of the good, wrought a &s;hame in the bad; and as for tho&s;e whom good ex|ample and their own ingenuity could not amend, the <HI>Laws</HI> and <HI>Ordinances of Warr</HI> were put in quick execution to re|&s;train them; &s;o that either for fear or &s;hame, there followed an univer&s;al change in the behaviour of the Soldiery <HI>Military Di&s;cipline</HI> was &s;oon revived after the &s;tricte&s;t examples of an|tient Severity; Quarters were di&s;charged, Plunder and Op|pre&s;&s;ion avoided; drunkenne&s;s, &s;wearing, la&s;iviou&s;ne&s;s, and all kindes of Luxury, were ca&s;hired; the work of God was bet|ter minded and carried on for the works &s;ake; Religious ex|erci&s;es and Conventions frequented, Godline&s;s advanced, and the power of godline&s;s made the onely ri&s;e of preferment: In the Intervalls of Action they lived like <HI>Saints,</HI> and at the point of Action, behaved them&s;elves like <HI>Lyons,</HI> being re&s;ol|ved to triumph, even in death, as an Army of <HI>Martyrs.</HI> In which po&s;ture and re&s;olution they continue to this very day.</P>
<P>Who&s;e hou&s;es have they at any time cau&s;le&s;ly burnt, in a vain humor of revenge and oftentation? who&s;e wives, or daughters have they ravi&s;hed? What Towns do they ran&s;ack?

<HEAD><HI>Out of &s;everal Letters written from the &s;aid City of</HI> Rheims, May 27. 1651.</HEAD>
<P>WE are here falne into a di&s;pair, by the di&s;order com|mitted in the Countrey by the Soldiery. The Re|giments of <HI>E&s;tampes</HI> and of <HI>Palluau</HI> the <HI>Forreiner,</HI> have heen here, and have received the <HI>E&s;tape,</HI> and yet have com|mitted &s;uch exce&s;&s;es as will make one tremble to think on. The Regiment of <HI>Palluau</HI> have burnt part of the Suburbs of <HI>E&s;pernay,</HI> have ravi&s;hed women and maids in the Coun|trey, and carried away all the hor&s;es of the poor Plough|men, where&s;oever they have pa&s;&s;ed, they have plundered the Gentlemens hou&s;es, and have taken from one alone 200 &s;heep, with all his hor&s;es and cattell: They have killed or wounded to death &s;everal per&s;ons, and they do hunt the poor Ploughmen, as one &s;hould hunt a hare in <HI>Champagne:</HI> nothing dare appear before them: The Cattel of the Vil|lages of <HI>Chenay</HI> and St. <HI>Thierry,</HI> have been wholly carrried a|way by them: In a word, it is no wor&s;e a de&s;olation then if an Army of hungry <HI>Barbarians</HI> had marched through the Province.

<P>The mi&s;ery is &s;uch here, that I think it cannot be holpen by the hands of men, be their minds never &s;o much affected to the remedy of it: God mu&s;t touch the hearts of the Grandees, and make them have a feeling knowledge of the publick de&s;olations, and give them an efficacious will to re|medy them: I know they hear enough of them, by the fre|quent recitals they have of them, but what comes into their ears, doth not come to their hearts, as it would do &s;hould they &s;ee it.</P>

<HEAD>The la&s;t day of <HI>May.</HI></HEAD>
<P>I could add to the Relation I have formerly &s;ent you of our mi&s;eries, but the little while you are re&s;olved to &s;tay, keeps me from telling you any thing more, but that it is im|po&s;&s;ible to hinder the ravi&s;hings, rapts, burnings, murders, and plundrings which are continued here with as much li|berty, as if they were not forbidden. Three daies &s;ince a Captain killed with his own hands and in cold blood, within a mu&s;quet &s;hot of our Gates, a poor Country man who was coming hither with his wife and a childe of &s;ix years old he led by the hand, the Countrey man not having &s;o much as &s;aid a word to him. I do mention that murther, not that it is alone, but becau&s;e it &s;eems more odious. The greate&s;t mi|&s;ery is, that there is no Ju&s;tice done, and that the Officers and Soldiers are a&s;&s;ured of the impunity, of what crime &s;oe|ver they may commit. The greate&s;t hurt done to them, is to re&s;tore what is <HI>in e&s;&s;e,</HI> when they pa&s;s through &s;ome City where they are not the &s;tronger: it is to be feared le&s;t tho&s;e who are to prevent tho&s;e di&s;orders, and do not u&s;e the authority they have in hand, do fall into the di&s;|grace, which ordinarily attends the inju&s;tice of tho&s;e who want care or courage to repre&s;s the crimes. Things are grown to &s;uch a height, that there is no excu&s;e now for &s;uch as are to &s;top the publick violences. I dare &s;ay no more, but that I wi&s;h tho&s;e who have in their hands the protection of the people, be as willing to help them, as they are knowing their oppre&s;&s;ions.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="entry">
<HEAD>Of the third of <HI>June.</HI></HEAD>
<P>You ought to expect nothing from me but complaints of our mi&s;eries, for although in my former Letters I have ac|quainted you with the chiefe&s;t circum&s;tances, yet the evil is carrried to the extremity, and time producing every moment, &s;ome new &s;ubjects of di&s;grace. I am forced to tell you that the Soldiers have lately killed the Curat of <HI>Baconne,</HI> and a Coun|trey man of the &s;ame place, who remained alone in the Vil|lage, whom they wounded with three &s;hot of a firelock in the head. They have plundred the Village of <HI>Nauroy,</HI> which
<PB N="7" REF="5">is in the Dominion of <HI>l'Ho&s;pital,</HI> where they left nothing, and killed two Inhabitants and wounded all the re&s;t, one only excepted who is fled. They have forced the hou&s;e called du Nuy&s;eman belonging to Madame de <HI>St. Piere,</HI> have plunder|ed it, killed <HI>Nicholas du Pont</HI> her farmor, and carried away all her hor&s;es and cattel. No body dares appeare abroad in the Countrey, where Robberyes, murders, burnings, ravi&s;h|ings and rand&s;omings are more frequent and more free then in the enemyes Country. Two or three things are the cau&s;es of that. 1. The impunity that reignes ab&s;olutely every where. 2. The want of paying the Souldiers: 3. the nece&s;&s;ity which is in the Province, were no bread being to be found the Soul|diers take the liberty to run and to plunder what&s;oever they meet withall.</P>
<P>The Mini&s;ters of State may be a&s;&s;ured of two things: fir&s;t that the Province is wholy ruinated without re&s;tource, and that &s;hortly it will be more de&s;olate then ever <HI>Lorrain</HI> hath been; 2. That before the Kings army be in a body it will be ruinated by the famine and want, nothing ab&s;olutely be|ing to be found here for its &s;ub&s;t&s;ience either of men or hor&s;es. I think that all the remainder of the people here are going to re&s;ort to <HI>Paris</HI> to begg their bread, which cannot but bring an infections aire there and &s;uch di&s;ea&s;es as the nece&s;&s;ity hath produced among them.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="entry">
<HEAD>Of the 5. of <HI>Iune.</HI></HEAD>
<P>I told you in my la&s;t part of the di&s;orders commited here by the Souldiery, but as every day begets &s;ome new violence; &s;o you &s;hall have no Letter of me, but it will tell you &s;ome new mi&s;ery we are at pre&s;ent &s;omuch &s;urrounded on al parts, and the advenues &s;o much po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, that it is impo&s;&s;ible either to come in or to goe out without danger both of life and of the goods; all Soldiers without exception running as &s;o many hungry wolfes upon the way, and not &s;paring the lives nor the goods of &s;uch as fall into their hands: They doe unteame the hor&s;es from the Ploughs and doe carry them away. And Saturday la&s;t they took within &s;ight of the Towne the hor&s;es of the Carriers who were bringing Victualls, wood and ne|ce&s;&s;arys
<PB N="8" REF="6">for the Inhabitants, and left their wagons upon the way: in two or three houres they took away above 100. hor&s;es and mi&s;u&s;ed tho&s;e who offered to re&s;i&s;t. I thinke that if over the de&s;paire hath bene excu&s;able; &s;uch as in this unhap|py age &s;hall be forced to a defence, will have a lawfull excu&s;e. The 3 In&s;tant one of our villages was a&s;&s;aulted in the night by 200. Men of <HI>Pallnau,</HI> who forced it, killed one of the In|habitants and wounded all the re&s;t, one only excepted, they tooke a way all the hor&s;es and Cowes, &s;tripped a Gentleman who is a Gens d'arme to the King, having very &s;curvily u&s;ed him before: His complaint having been adre&s;&s;ed to me here, I have arre&s;ted three Officers untill the Commander hath given &s;atisfaction. The &s;ame day Mr. <HI>de Fremont's</HI> hou&s;e, whom you know was forced and plundered, and the &s;ouldiers hav|ing undermined the Dongeon, he and his &s;onne in Law Mr. <HI>de Mai&s;ieres</HI> was forced to run away through the Souldiers with their Pi&s;tols cockt in their hands. Ye&s;ternight the Vil|lage of <HI>Bourgoigne</HI> was plundered and the women &s;triped &s;tarke naked. Never France &s;aw &s;uch extremityes. The la&s;t yeare though full of mi&s;ery was nothing neare comparable to this. I e&s;teeme that now the only hand of God is able to helpe us, &s;ince the earthly powers if they can, they will not. I cannot but griefe you by the rehear&s;all of the&s;e calamitys, but you mu&s;t be partaker of the mi&s;erys of the Province, though you be ab&s;ent.</P>

<DIV2 TYPE="entry">
<HEAD>Of the 7. of <HI>Iune.</HI></HEAD>
<P>I would end here the recitall of our mi&s;erys, &s;hould I not be confident you will &s;tay til the <HI>arivall</HI> of my Lord Bi&s;hop of <HI>Chaalons,</HI> who goes to witne&s;&s;e the de&s;olation of the Province, not being able to &s;ee any longer the violence and oppre&s;&s;i|on, without giving warning to tho&s;e who have the remedy in their hands. I have told in my la&s;t how the Gentlemen's hou&s;es have lo&s;t the priviledges and the re&s;pect, which cover|ed them from the in&s;olency of the Souldiery; they were not long &s;ince a &s;helter to &s;ome of our Cittizens, who enjoyed the protection which the birth of the Nobles gave them hither|to, but now they are no more, regarded then others, and
<PB N="9" REF="6">their hou&s;es looke no otherwi&s;e now then &s;o many &s;tore|hou&s;es, where the Country people hath gathered the remain|der of their wrack, that it might be &s;o much the more ea&s;ily carried away. They are not content to plunder the Noble|men's hou&s;es; but them&s;elves are ignominiou&s;ly &s;tripped, and their Wives and Daughters are not free from that di&s;honour. Many in their pre&s;ence have bin &s;tripped to their very &s;mocks, and we could not keepe our teares, when we &s;aw per&s;ons of that condition, who have &s;everall times ventured their lives and e&s;tate for the &s;ervice of the King and Kingdome, run away to us in raggs they had borrowed of &s;ome poore Coun|treymen to hide their nakednes. I dare not exagerate the|evill, le&s;t the readers of the&s;e fruitle&s;&s;e Storys, and tho&s;e who will not remedy them, as they are bound by their authority, thinke it is rather an amplificated di&s;cour&s;e then a true Story. Yet I thinke my &s;elfe obliged to tell you againe that the di&s;|order is infinitly above what I can tell or write. The King's Subjects are no le&s;&s;e mole&s;ted, then if they were in the hands of the Barbarians their enemys, for their blood, their goods, their quietne&s;&s;e, their honour are no way &s;pared. A Mayde &s;ome two dayes &s;ince flying (to &s;ave her honour) from the hands of &s;ome unhappy Souldiers who pur&s;ued her very nar|rowly, her zeale to the pre&s;ervation of her cha&s;tity cau&s;ed her death; the&s;e madd fellowes not able to overtake her afore &s;he came into the Village of <HI>Sillery,</HI> where &s;he intended to have &s;aved her &s;elfe, &s;hot at her, &s;o that &s;he fell downe dead and her corps was thrown by the&s;e Villains into a fen. Ye&s;|ternight the Mills of <HI>Tinqueux,</HI> of the Abbe&s;&s;e and of the Archbi&s;hop, and the <HI>Folleries,</HI> have beene forced and plun|dred, and what &s;oever was found in carried away, which cau&s;|eth here a great heat, becau&s;e abundance of Merchants in|tere&s;&s;ed in the taking of the Marchandi&s;es, which have been valued, have kept &s;uch quarter, that Mr <HI>de Bezancon,</HI> hath beene forced to get on hor&s;eback and repaire to the place where the Regiment doth quarter, to take an order about it.

I thinke I have told you how the Regiment of the <HI>Poloneis,</HI> had on the day of the Holy Sacrament, forced the Ca&s;tle <HI>du Co&s;&s;on,</HI> bro|ken open the Gates with Axes, and plundered the hou&s;e, out of which they carryed for the value of about 4000.

<P>This word will be the clo&s;e of all the circum&s;tances of the impietys and di&s;orders mentioned in my former Letters; and as it is one of the greate&s;t inhumanitys that might fall into the apprehen&s;ion of a man, it comes very fitly the la&s;t, that being added to an infinite number of others you have repre|&s;ented to tho&s;e in authority for a remedy, it might worke

Some Souldiers of the Regiment of <HI>Navarre</HI> came lately into the Village of <HI>Beaumont,</HI> under the conduct of a Sergeant to looke for women or maydens to full their bru|tality. Some of them, mooved by noy&s;e, ran away and e&s;caped by &s;ome byways.

The mother being wild to &s;ee &s;uch an abominable &s;pectacle, did what &s;he could to hinder them, and becau&s;e &s;he di&s;turbed them, they forceably turned her out of the roome, and with words which I dare not foule a Letter with, they forceably did &s;hut her out, untill tho&s;e among them who had inhuma|nity enough to ravi&s;h her daughter, had done. Then they leaving her for dead they went away and gave liberty to the mother to come to her daughter againe: but the &s;ame day they returned to make an end of an action which will make the earth guilty before God, and will make the Land lyable to a publick Plague, if &s;uch an horrible crime be not revenged: They offered to ravi&s;h the Mother, but &s;he being &s;tronger, they forced her to run away from the roome, and having &s;hut her out againe they continued their cruelty upon the daughter, and made her dye in the endeavours of a brutality, which the Divell would not doe, had he a body: This goes beyond human beleife, and truly now adays tho&s;e that pro|fe&s;&s;e to beare armes, have nothing of man but the face.</P>
<P>That &s;ame Regiment have plundred three days &s;ince the Village of <HI>Avaux</HI> belonging to Mr. <HI>le Pre&s;ident de Me&s;mes,</HI> carried away all the Cows, Hor&s;es, and goods, leaving no|thing.</P>

<P>Since my Letters in this mi&s;erable time cannot be but a &s;ad Hi&s;tory of our misfortunes, give me leave to tell you two things, which take away from me all hopes of redre&s;s. The fir&s;t, That although our di&s;a&s;ters be well enough known, and that tho&s;e who are to remedy them, have their eyes o|pened, yet no order is taken for it, by want of will; for it goes again&s;t the common &s;ence of all men, to &s;ay that a So|veraign King, who can do what&s;oever he plea&s;eth, wants power to do what he ought to will. Therefore no marvel if in &s;tead of dimini&s;hing, the &s;aid di&s;orders are increa&s;ing daily, even to producing &s;uch implieties, as hell it &s;elf is not capable of. The &s;econd is, That having given us &s;ome hope of breathing, by the orders &s;ent for the removing of &s;uch Forces as were upon us, new ones are pre&s;ently &s;ent to take their place; which makes us believe that our ruine is una|voidable, and that in vain we have complained, &s;ince the end of our mi&s;eries, is the beginning of greater ones. I might &s;ay much thereupon, but I chu&s;e rather to make it &s;hort, telling you onely what hapned ye&s;terday hereabouts by the violence of the Regiment of <HI>Harcourt,</HI> who a&s;&s;aulted a Con|voy of 10 Carts full of Corn coming from <HI>Chaalon</HI> hither for the relief of our extream nece&s;&s;ity, wounded two of the Cartmen to death, and all the re&s;t le&s;s dangerou&s;ly, took 7 hor&s;es, 22 &s;acks of corn, and a cart full of Oats. I know not the tenth part of the di&s;orders that happen hereabouts; Judge by the pattern what may be the pieces.</P>
<P>I dur&s;t not rehears any particulars of the Sacriledges and
<PB N="16" REF="10">horrible profanations of the holy things, and of the holy of the holys, which we know, for fear the continual recital of the&s;e abominations, and the expo&s;ing of the&s;e horrors to the publick view, do force at la&s;t heaven to cau&s;e the earth to gape, or &s;end down his thunderbotls and his fire to con&s;ume what&s;oever might keep the memory of the high impunity of tho&s;e crimes and execrable impieties. Every one knows the plundering and pillaging of all our Churches la&s;t year, both by the enemies Forces, and by our own, to the full knowledge of the Officers and Commanders, and of &s;uch as were appointed to do Ju&s;tice, yet no puni&s;hment made, nor even an intent to do it, &s;o that nothing was left in the Churches for their Mini&s;try, nor even the little mettal u&s;ed in the Bapti&s;tery. The rigours and violences committed by the Soldiers upon the Curats and Church-Officers, by the plundring of what&s;oever was nece&s;&s;ary for their &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, and the exce&s;&s;es practi&s;ed upon their per&s;ons, which forced the poor Shepheards to for&s;ake their Flocks and leave them without any help and a&s;&s;i&s;tance upon their death bed, which is not denied even to the greate&s;t Criminals condemned to death, are al&s;o very well known.</P>
<P>The Kings Declaration of the 27 of <HI>January</HI> la&s;t, verified in Parliament the 24 of <HI>April</HI> bears the truth of the report of the&s;e Sacrileges and execrable attempts upon the &s;acred per&s;on of the Son of God, and the puni&s;hment ordered: but that Declaration hath been without execution; with &s;hame we can &s;ay that this year our Churches have not been other|wi&s;e plundred, but by lo&s;ing and carrying away &s;uch orna|ments as had been begged and given by way of alms in <HI>Pa|ris</HI> during the la&s;t winter, for the re&s;tabli&s;hing of the exer|ci&s;es of Religion in mo&s;t of our &s;aid Churches, which was wholly cea&s;ed, had it not been for that &s;uyply, and which will cea&s;e hereafter, notwith&s;tanding our ancient po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion which we do ju&s;tifie &s;ince the e&s;tabli&s;hment of this State.</P>
