<HEAD>A TRUE and IMPARTIAL HISTORY OF THE <HI>Kingdom of</HI> Ireland, DESCRIBING Its Situation, Ancient Inhabitants, Man|ners, Cu&s;toms, and the State it was found in at the Time it was Invaded and Conquered by the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> in the Reign of King <HI>Henry</HI> II. &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>THE Kingdom of <HI>Ireland</HI> is of no mean Extent, but rather very large and con&s;iderable; It is an I&s;land, it is bounded on the <HI>Ea&s;t</HI> with <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Scotland,</HI> on the <HI>We&s;t</HI> with the main Ocean, on the <HI>South</HI> with part of <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Normandy,</HI> and on the <HI>North</HI> with the <HI>Du|calidonian</HI> Sea. It is, as all other I&s;lands, &s;ur|rounded with Water, containing in Length 400, and in Breadth 200 Miles, and is e&s;pe|cially
<PB N="2" REF="7"> parted or divided into four Provinces, <HI>viz. Mun&s;ter,</HI> which is again divided into the Counties of <HI>Limerick, Kerrey, Waterford, Cork, De&s;mon,</HI> and the <HI>Holy Cro&s;s</HI> in <HI>Tipperary.</HI> 2. The Province of <HI>Lein&s;ter,</HI> divided into the Coun|ties of the <HI>Ea&s;t</HI> and <HI>We&s;t Meaths, Kilkenney, Caterlough, King's County, Kildare, Wexford, Dublin</HI> and <HI>Wicklow.</HI> 3. The Province of <HI>Connought,</HI> divided into the Counties of <HI>Clare, Thumond, Majo, Sligo, Letarim,</HI> and <HI>Ro&s;comon.</HI> 4. The Province of <HI>&V;l&s;ter,</HI> divided into the Counties of <HI>Tyrconnel, Tyrone, Cavan, Coleraine, Monaghan, Antrim, Down, Armah,</HI> and <HI>Lough;</HI> and the&s;e are for the mo&s;t part at this day re|pleni&s;hed with many con&s;iderable Cities and Towns, of which I &s;hall have occa&s;ion to &s;peak in the Series of this Hi&s;tory, as they &s;hall fall in their proper places. The Country is natu|rally very fruitful, and &s;eems by the Soil al|ways to have been &s;o, though the Natives have not appear'd very active in improving it, as being naturally given up to &s;loath, or to live by War and Rapine. As for the fir&s;t Peopling it after <HI>Noah</HI>'s Flood, it remains ve|ry much, if not altogether in the dark, the Natives having been impo&s;ed on by Monks and Bards, a &s;ort of Rimers and Fortune-Tel|lers, with Fables for Reality, though it is con|jectured by the Learned, that this I&s;land was Peopled upon the Confu&s;ion of Tongues at <HI>Ba|bel,</HI> &s;oon after the Flood; and the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Hi&s;to|rians of the be&s;t account, tell us, That one <HI>Ba|&s;tolenus,</HI> encouraged by the Example of <HI>Nim|rod</HI> in <HI>Syria,</HI> &s;ettled his Monarchy in the We|&s;tern
<PB N="3" REF="7"> I&s;lands, and among&s;t others peopled this; yet where he kept his head Re&s;idence no men|tion is made, but that his three Sons ruling there, had War with Giants that grew up in the Land and rebelled again&s;t them; and that afterward divers <HI>Scythians</HI> roving to &s;eek Ad|ventures, got footing there; and &s;o they go on in the doubtful Paths of Uncertainty a great way farther: But true it is, that according to our own Hi&s;tories, and tho&s;e of other Nations, the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> began very early to rove abroad, and in their Boats, and &s;uch kind of Ships as they had, coming frequently a&s;hore in <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Scotland,</HI> and other Places, did great Mi&s;chief by Burning and Plundering, but were frequent|ly met withal, and a great many of them kil|led. Nor do we find that the <HI>Romans,</HI> when they conquered <HI>Britain,</HI> extended their Arms to <HI>Ireland.</HI></P>
<P>It is held they were Converted to the Chri|&s;tian Religion by St. <HI>James</HI> the Apo&s;tle; and &s;ome give large grounds for it: but their Au|thors will have it done by one <HI>Paladinus,</HI> &s;ent thither to that purpo&s;e by Pope <HI>Cele&s;tine,</HI> but more e&s;pecially perfected by St. <HI>Patrick,</HI> to whom they a&s;cribe a thou&s;and Incredibilities: But to leave the&s;e Conjectures that are not greatly pertinent to our Matter, we now come nearer to that for which we have more War|rant and Certainty.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t Acquaintance that the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> had with the <HI>Iri&s;h,</HI> as to any thing that is remark|able, was in the Reign of <HI>Henry</HI> the Second of <HI>England,</HI> their chief Communication being with
<PB N="4" REF="8"> <HI>France,</HI> whether they &s;ent &s;everal Bands of Sol|diers to help them again&s;t the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> who were Waring there under their King for the Recovery of his Right in the Provinces that were his Grand-father's, which he ha|ving pretty well &s;ettled, turned his Thoughts upon <HI>Ireland,</HI> where he heard they were at Variance among them&s;elves, the whole Land being divided under many Petty Princes, when it luckily happened a bu&s;ine&s;s fell out that gave him an ea&s;ie Inlet to the Conque&s;t of it; for in the Year 1167. the Ea&s;tern Part of the I&s;land along the Sea being po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by <HI>Dormat Mac-mur,</HI> King of <HI>Lein&s;ter,</HI> his Cruel|ties had highly incen&s;ed his Subjects again&s;t him, and what more rai&s;ed their Fury, was, the Injury he did to <HI>Morice</HI> King of <HI>Meath,</HI> by wheedling away his Queen, and living with her in Adultery; &s;o that the inraged Husband &s;eeking Reparation and Revenge, invaded his Countries, by the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of <HI>Roderick O Co|nor,</HI> King of <HI>Connaught,</HI> at the Terror of who&s;e Approach, <HI>Dormat</HI> being dete&s;ted by, and for|&s;aken of his Subjects, was forced to flie to <HI>Eng|land,</HI> and there implored Protection; which upon taking an Oath of Fidelity and Obedi|ence to the King, was freely given him; and <HI>Henry,</HI> with a Sum of Money, procured leave of Pope <HI>Adrian,</HI> an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI>-man, promoted to St. <HI>Peter</HI>'s Chair, that he might Conquer <HI>Ire|land,</HI> promi&s;ing moreover, throughly to e&s;ta|bli&s;h the Chri&s;tian Religion, and bring it to an Acknowledgment of the See of <HI>Rome;</HI> but whil&s;t he was preparing to pa&s;s the Seas; new
<PB N="5" REF="8"> Troubles aro&s;e in his <HI>French</HI> Territories, that required his Pre&s;ence; yet by his Letters Pa|tents he gave Leave, with Encouragement to his Nobles, and &s;uch others as were willing to go for <HI>Ireland.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Dormat</HI> impatient of his Exile, mainly up|on this Conce&s;&s;ion, &s;olicited <HI>Richard</HI> the King's Son, promi&s;ing not only his Daughter, a very beautiful young Lady in Marriage, but great Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions in the Country, when he &s;hould be re&s;tored, and all his Territories after his Death. The young Prince being of a Warlike Tem|per, and thir&s;ting after Glory, re&s;olved, though his Father was ab&s;ent, to undertake this Expe|dition; and early the next Spring &s;ailed from <HI>Bri&s;tol</HI> with divers Ships, on Board which were thirty Knights, &s;ixty E&s;quires, and three hundred Archers, the fir&s;t <HI>Engli&s;h-men</HI> ever known to land in a Ho&s;tile-manner in <HI>Ireland,</HI> and being met by <HI>Dormat</HI> with &s;uch Forces as he, going over a little before, had rai&s;ed, they &s;eized upon the Town of <HI>Wexford,</HI> which was given to one <HI>Fitz-Stevens,</HI> a <HI>Welch</HI> Gentleman, according to Agreement upon his rai&s;ing part of the Forces; &s;o that News of this, and o|ther Succe&s;&s;es flying to <HI>England,</HI> many Adven|turers came over; and although the Petty Kings joyned their Forces, yet were they beat in divers bloody Battels: and <HI>Dormat</HI> being re&s;tored, had <HI>Dublin</HI> &s;ubmitted to him, inflict|ing grievous Puni&s;hments upon &s;uch of his Ca|pital Enemies as he found there.</P>
<P>The Prince being now in <HI>Ireland,</HI> greatly increa&s;ing in Strength, that came over to him,
<PB N="6" REF="9"> carried all before him; which made King <HI>Henry,</HI> who feared the Prince's a&s;piring upon &s;uch Succe&s;&s;es, and willing to have the honour of Conquering &s;o large a Kingdom him&s;elf, &s;ent his Mandate to recall the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> out of <HI>Ireland,</HI> &s;o that but a few being left with the Prince in <HI>Dublin,</HI> and they reduced to a great &s;treight by the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> that had taken heart, they neverthele&s;s Sallied upon an Army of 30000 with not above 1500 Men, and utterly routed them, taking great Spoil; and then coming for <HI>England,</HI> he &s;urrendered all the Cities and Forts he had taken into his Father's Hands, for <HI>Dormat</HI> by this time was dead; and in the Year 1172. King <HI>Henry</HI> landed with a Royal Army, which brought &s;uch a Terrour upon <HI>Ireland,</HI> that <HI>Roderick,</HI> and mo&s;t of the Petty Princes that were Independent, or his Tribu|taries, came with their humble Supplications to intreat him, <HI>That he would take the Govern|ment upon him, as their Supream Prince and Lord:</HI> So that at <HI>Chri&s;tmas</HI> he made them a Noble Fea&s;t in <HI>Dublin;</HI> and &s;ettled the King|dom in Civil and Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Matters, Re|forming Abu&s;es and Barbarities: And &s;oon af|ter tho&s;e that held out in <HI>&V;l&s;ter</HI> were brought to &s;ubmit, from which time we may Date the Conque&s;t of <HI>Ireland</HI> by the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> under which Soveraignty it has ever &s;ince remained as a conquered Kingdom, and now annexed to the Crown: yet the Natives who are gene|rally hot &s;pirited, unea&s;ie, and re&s;tle&s;s under Re&s;traint, have often &s;trugled to break this Chain, though to the Lo&s;s and Di&s;advantage mo&s;tly of them&s;elves.</P>
<PB N="7" REF="9">
<P>King <HI>Richard</HI> the Fir&s;t, by rea&s;on of his Wars in the <HI>Holy Land,</HI> his Impri&s;onment up|on his Return in <HI>Au&s;tria</HI> and the Empire, and other Di&s;appointments he met with at home, had no War with the <HI>Iri&s;h,</HI> nor happened there any thing extraordinary, but care and indu&s;try to &s;ettle the Government; which was done with &s;uch tenderne&s;s, that the Na|tives being more civilized, began to think them&s;elves happy in the change, and that they were redeemed from perpetual War, which when &s;o many Princes governed as Ab&s;olute in their Dominions, could not be avoided a|mong &s;o rough and &s;tubborn a People. But becau&s;e King <HI>Edward</HI> the Fir&s;t had &s;ent for Forces out of <HI>Ireland,</HI> to help him again&s;t the <HI>Scots,</HI> with whom he had mortal Wars, the wilder &s;ort of the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> in <HI>Edward</HI> the Second's time invited them over, and many of the leading Men of the Natives revolting, ruining the Country; but upon the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> joyning Battel with them they were routed, and a|bout 11000 &s;lain, among whom was a King of <HI>Connought,</HI> and one <HI>Okly</HI> a Lord of great Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions: but &s;oon after the Lord <HI>Roger Mortimer</HI> being &s;ent over as Lord Ju&s;tice of <HI>Ireland,</HI> he managed Matters &s;o ill, that the <HI>Scots</HI> were again called in under <HI>Edward Bruce,</HI> Brother to the <HI>Scots</HI> King, who taking &s;everal places by the Revolt of the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> from the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Obedience, cau&s;ed him&s;elf to be Crowned King of <HI>Ireland;</HI> But in a great Bat|tel his Forces being routed, and he labouring to re&s;train their flight, was killed by one <HI>More|pa&s;s,</HI>
<PB N="8" REF="10"> whom he likewi&s;e requited with Death before his Fall, and the dead Bodies fell by that means on each other, which happened in the Year 1320.</P>
<P>However, they were rather di&s;per&s;ed than broken, doing con&s;iderable Mi&s;chief where they found an opportunity to fall upon the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> that had &s;ettled them&s;elves in the Towns and Villages near the Sea, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>In the Year 1329. during the Reign of King <HI>Edward</HI> the Third, the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> in <HI>Lein&s;ter</HI> and <HI>Meath</HI> rebelled; again&s;t whom the Earl of <HI>Ormond</HI> drew out what Forces he could, but being over-poured in number, was de|feated, and the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> made great Spoils of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, and among&s;t other Barba|rities, burnt eighty of them in a Church where they had fled for Refuge; but at la&s;t the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> fortified them&s;elves in <HI>Wexford,</HI> and upon their approach to be&s;iege it, &s;allied out upon them with &s;uch Courage, that Succe&s;s crowned it, and 4000 of the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> were killed, mo&s;t of them that fled being hotly pur&s;ued, were drowned in the River <HI>Slane;</HI> which with &s;ome other Encounters, where Victory decla|red on our &s;ide, &s;o quelled them, that in this King's Reign they rebelled no more.</P>
<P><HI>Anno</HI> 1398. in the Reign of King <HI>Richard</HI> the Second, the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> fell again into Rebellion, and by Surprize fall upon the King's Lieute|nant, and divers Per&s;ons of Quality, whom they &s;lew; which made the King with con&s;i|derable Forces ha&s;te thither, and Landing, he put them in all parts to the Rout, killing a
<PB N="9" REF="10"> great many, and taking &s;everal of their Ring|leaders; and keeping his Court of State at <HI>Dublin,</HI> to him re&s;orted the Nobility and chief of the <HI>Iri&s;h,</HI> &s;ubmitting and paying him Ho|mage, promi&s;ing to keep the Country in quiet for the future: but Troubles ari&s;ing in <HI>Eng|land,</HI> the King ha&s;tily left <HI>Ireland,</HI> and was no &s;ooner arrived in <HI>Wales,</HI> but finding him|&s;elf de&s;erted, he betook him to a Ca&s;tle, where he was &s;eized by <HI>Henry</HI> Duke of <HI>Lanca&s;ter,</HI> to whom he re&s;ign'd his Crown, and was after|ward inhumanly murthered. Upon who&s;e Death many Troubles and Contentions aro&s;e; &s;o that the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> being embroyled at home, <HI>Ireland</HI> was little minded, the People there doing, in a manner, what they plea&s;ed. But in the Reign of <HI>Henry</HI> the Fifth, we being &s;etled at home, more care was taken to prevent the Outrages and Depradations of the <HI>Iri&s;h;</HI> in|&s;omuch, that &s;everal who had been formerly Offenders were puni&s;hed, and others fled, a|mong&s;t whom were divers of their great Ones, who notwith&s;tanding the care of the Earl of <HI>Ormond,</HI> then Lieutenant of the Kingdom, to repre&s;s them, drew a great multitude of Peo|ple into Rebellion: but the Earl gave Battel at <HI>Redmore-Athy,</HI> where the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> under the Leading of <HI>O Moor,</HI> &s;tood &s;toutly to it as Men in de&s;pair; but after a bloody Fight, that co|loured all the Ditches of the F<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ns with Blood, the Battel-&s;werved, and the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> were defeat|ed with great &s;laughter.

<PB N="10" REF="11"> that nothing memorably occurs in Hi&s;tory, till the Reign of <HI>Henry</HI> the Seventh, when the Earl of <HI>Kildare</HI> being Deputy, one <HI>Richard Symons</HI> a Prie&s;t, wheedled him into a belief, that one <HI>Lambert</HI> a Youth, whom he had brought up as his Scholar, was really the Earl of <HI>Warwick,</HI> Son to <HI>George</HI> Duke of <HI>Clarence,</HI> Brother to King <HI>Edward</HI> the Fourth, that had e&s;caped out of the <HI>Tower,</HI> and was come thi|ther for protection; and the young Spark ha|ving been well tutored, and of a graceful Carriage, &s;o well acted his part, that not only the Lieutenant, but a great many of the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Nobility &s;ided with him, rai&s;ing con&s;iderable Forces to e&s;pou&s;e his Quarrel, Crowning him King in <HI>Dublin,</HI> and not content to keep him there, they brought him with a con&s;iderable Army into <HI>England,</HI> landing in <HI>Lanca&s;hire,</HI> and Proclaiming him.

<P>He &s;taid a while to vi&s;it <HI>Dublin,</HI> and then marched with a compleat Army to be&s;iege <HI>Drogheda,</HI> wherein was a &s;trong Gar|ri&s;on of <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and <HI>Iri&s;h,</HI> it being upon the Rumour of his Approach reinforced with Two thou&s;and five hundred Foot, and Three hundred Hor&s;e; and although it was &s;toutly defended, yet it was carried by Force, and by the too cruel Order of the General, all were put to the Sword, not re&s;pecting Age nor Sex, except a very few who hid them|&s;elves for many Days, till the Fury was over: And here it is the more to be lamented, be|cau&s;e this Brunt fell mo&s;tly upon many brave <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Gentlemen, who were got into the

Other Towns were likewi&s;e taken by Storm, and treated at the like rate; &s;o that a bloody Ven|geance &s;eemed to fall heavy upon a great ma|ny that were Innocent for the Sins of the Guil|ty, who had &s;o lately polluted the Land with Innocent Blood, and now kept mo&s;tly out of the way in the Mountains, Bogs, and Fa&s;tne&s;|&s;es; however, being at la&s;t hunted from place to place, a great number fell by the Sword, Famine, and Pe&s;tilence, in&s;omuch that the Land was greatly Depopulated, a third part of the People being wa&s;ted, and had &s;evere Task-Ma&s;ters over them that made them Groan un|der their Burthens, till <HI>Charles</HI> the Second came to lighten their Sholders, and re&s;tore them again their Peace and Ea&s;e, by Acce&s;&s;ion to the Crown upon the Happy Re&s;tauration; &s;o that the People wearied with their former Mi&s;eries, began to be out of love with War and In&s;urrections, and &s;eemed mightily in|clinable to Peace.

<P>The Earl of <HI>Tyrconnel,</HI> who had been rai|&s;ed by King <HI>James,</HI> when Duke of <HI>York,</HI> from a mean to a con&s;iderable Figure, was looked upon as a fit In&s;trument to carry on the De|&s;ign in that Kingdom; and therefore upon the re-calling of the Right Honourable the Earl of <HI>Clarendon,</HI> he was made Lord-Lieutenant, and &s;oon gave the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> great Hopes of Supe|riority over the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> in that Kingdom, by fir&s;t Ca&s;hiering the Prote&s;tant Soldiers and Officers that were in Arms, and then the Of|ficers and Mini&s;ters of Ju&s;tice: And though there were Complaints made again&s;t him at the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Court, yet they were not regard|ed, but he the rather encouraged in his En|terprizes; in&s;omuch, that things run &s;o high that many feared a fatal Event, and di|vers left thereupon the Kingdom; &s;ome going for <HI>Holland,</HI> others for <HI>Scotland</HI> and <HI>England:</HI> and in &s;uch a method Matters continued to be pu&s;hed violently on, till News came of a purpo&s;ed Inva&s;ion of the

<P>The Prince and Prince&s;s being proclaimed King and Queen of <HI>England, France</HI> and <HI>Ire|land,</HI> on the 14th of <HI>February,</HI> 1688. upon the Humble Addre&s;s of both Hou&s;es of Parlia|ment, great care was taken for the &s;peedy &s;uccouring the oppre&s;&s;ed Prote&s;tants of <HI>Ireland;</HI> and that the Papi&s;ts in Arms again&s;t them, might be left without Excu&s;e, a Proclamation was &s;ent over, offering, among other things, a Pardon and Indempnity for all that &s;hould in Obedience to it lay down their Arms and re|tire to their re&s;pective places of Abode, and there peaceably behave them&s;elves as obedi|ent Subjects ought to do, upon which Condi|tion they &s;hould in full Freedom enjoy their E&s;tates according to Law, and that the <HI>Roman Catholicks</HI> upon &s;uch a Con&s;ideration &s;hould have all the Favour that the Law allows for the private Exerci&s;e of their Religion; with a further Promi&s;e, That a Parliament &s;hould be &s;peedily called in that Kingdom: But up|on refu&s;ing to comply with the Royal Man|date, to be e&s;teemed as Rebels and Traytors to the Crown of <HI>England,</HI> &amp;c. their Lands and Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions to be Forfeited, and di&s;po&s;ed of by way of Di&s;tribution among tho&s;e that &s;hould be Aiding and A&s;&s;i&s;ting in the Reducing the Kingdom to its Obedience.</P>
<P>This Royal Conce&s;&s;ion, though <HI>Tyrconnel</HI> la|boured what in him lay to hinder its being di&s;per&s;ed, wrought &s;ome good Effects, not|with&s;tanding that Earl, to counter-ballance it,
<PB N="31" REF="21"> put forth a Paper which he termed his Decla|ration, not only therein in&s;inuating what great Advantage the Kingdom would reap by &s;tand|ing out.

<P>The&s;e violent proceedings made tho&s;e that thought upon the Earl's Protection, they might have &s;ome confidence in their continuance as to &s;afety, begin to make away for the Sea-coa&s;t; and although the Ma&s;ters of Ships were commanded on pain of Death to tran|&s;port none, yet many e&s;caped to <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Scotland,</HI> where they were well received, and Provi&s;ion made for them by way of Publick Brief and Collection, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>About the latter end of <HI>March</HI> the Abdica|ted King landed in <HI>Ireland,</HI> with a great Train of Officers, but very few Forces, and was received at <HI>Dublin</HI> with a mixture of Joy and Sorrow, bringing with him as his Su|pervi&s;or Mon&s;ieur <HI>D'Avaux,</HI> with &s;ome <HI>French</HI> Generals.

<PB N="33" REF="22"> every thing by force or &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion; and more Soldiers were Li&s;ted and Regimented under the <HI>French</HI> Officers that came over, and care taken to lay up Stores.

<P>Whil&s;t the&s;e things were doing at Land, the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Navy being out at Sea with a &s;trict Charge to hinder Corre&s;pondence between <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Ireland,</HI> the Squadron under the Command of Admiral <HI>Herbert,</HI> had Notice by their Scout Ships, that part of the <HI>French</HI> Fleet was abroad, and &s;tood away to the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Coa&s;t: Whereupon he made all the Sail he could after them, and the next Day found they &s;tood into <HI>Bantry Bay,</HI> a very &s;pacious bearing in of the Sea, and though for fear of the Shallows, and other Difficulties that might offer, it proved a work of Difficulty to enter upon them, for they &s;eemed no ways willing to come out to an Engagement, not|with&s;tanding they were much &s;uperiour in number; yet the Admiral drawing his Ships into a Line, and lying upon the &s;tretch, bat|tered them extreamly from Ten in the Morn|ing, till Five in the Afternoon, at what time the <HI>French</HI> Admiral tacked from us, and &s;tood farther into the Bay. We killed them a great many Men; and &s;ome of our Men delared, they &s;aw one of their great Ships go to the bottom. On our &s;ide we lo&s;t Captain <HI>Aylmer</HI>

<P>Our Fleet after this Engagement came back to <HI>Port&s;mouth,</HI> and there refitted, whe|ther the King of <HI>England</HI> went to take a view of them, and Dining aboard the Admiral, created him Earl of <HI>Torrington,</HI> &amp;c. and di|&s;tributed about Six thou&s;and pound among the Seamen.</P>
<P>And now the <HI>French</HI> having violated the Peace, and undeniably begun the War in in|vading <HI>Ireland,</HI> the King delayed not to de|nounce the War again&s;t them by a Declara|tion to that purport, bearing Dare the Se|venth of <HI>May,</HI> 1689. and great Preparations were made for pa&s;&s;ing over to <HI>Ireland,</HI> For|ces were Levied in all parts of <HI>England,</HI> and Money prepared for defraying the Charge of the Expedition; which was the more facili|tated, upon the E&s;tates of <HI>Scotland</HI> &s;ubmit|ting their Crown to King <HI>William</HI> and Queen <HI>Mary,</HI> and taking of them upon their be|ing owned and inve&s;ted King and Queen of that Kingdom, which they did by their Com|mi&s;&s;ioners, who waited upon Their Maje&s;ties to that purpo&s;e, in the <HI>Banquetting-Hou&s;e</HI> at <HI>Whitehall.</HI> And the Vi&s;count of <HI>Dundee,</HI> who had headed the Rebel <HI>Highlanders,</HI> and others in that Kingdom, being killed in a fatal Bat|tel near St. <HI>John&s;town,</HI> things began to go

<P>Upon News brought that <HI>Maccarty</HI> was in tho&s;e Parts with a &s;trong Party, plundering and ravaging the Country. Lieutenant-Co|lonel <HI>Berry,</HI> with three Companies of Foot, eight Troops of Hor&s;e, and three of Dra|goons, marched towards them; but upon their approach, found they were made &s;tron|ger than they were reported, by another Par|ty that had joyned them, and were much &s;u|periour to him in number; which obliged him before he found him&s;elf &s;ufficiently &s;trong to attack them, to &s;end to Colonel <HI>Wool&s;ey</HI> at <HI>In|niskilling,</HI> for a Re-inforcement; which he no &s;ooner obtained, but he charged them with much bravery, killing a con&s;iderable Num|ber, taking &s;ome Pri&s;oners, and putting the re&s;t to flight; but the Flyers in their way being greatly re-inforced, rallied, and came to &s;econd Encounter, which for a time con|tinued bloody and doubtful, they by rea&s;on of their advantageous Po&s;t, much galling our Hor&s;e with their Cannon; but the Defiles, or dirty narrow Pa&s;&s;ages being re&s;olutely pa&s;&s;ed by our Foot and Dragoons, they made them|&s;elves Ma&s;ters of the Cannon, which gave our Hor&s;e the advantage to charge the Enemies Hor&s;e, who thereupon de&s;erted the Foot and
<PB N="36" REF="24"> fled, and the Foot after them, a great many being killed, and &s;ome taken Pri&s;oners, by which Defeat the Country was freed from great Incumbrances. This part of the Ene|mies Army that had a long time lain heavy upon it, being by this means, and in this Bat|tel, fell of the Enemy by the Sword, and tho&s;e that were drowned in de&s;perately throwing them&s;elves into the Lough to e&s;cape the Pur|&s;uers, about Three thou&s;and.</P>
<P>There happened likewi&s;e divers other Ren|counters of le&s;&s;er note, wherein the Prote|&s;tants for the greate&s;t part gained the advan|tage.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t the&s;e things were doing, the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Army, with King <HI>James</HI> at the Head of it, marched towards <HI>London-Derry,</HI> promi&s;ing them&s;elves, the Terrour of their Arms would oblige it to a Surrender upon their fir&s;t ap|proach; but found they were extreamly mi|&s;taken; for although Colonel <HI>Lundy</HI> the Go|vernour, and the two Regiments &s;ent from <HI>England,</HI> under the Colonels <HI>Cunningham</HI> and <HI>Richards,</HI> had withdrawn and &s;lighted it, as a place not tenable again&s;t an Army of Forty thou&s;and Men, with a Train of Artillery and divers Mortars; Providence &s;o ordered, it be|came the Bulwark of the &s;inking Nation, and gave the Enemy their fir&s;t con&s;iderable check; for divers Troops that were abroad, mo&s;tly compo&s;ed of undi&s;ciplined Soldiers, throwing them&s;elves into it, they, together with tho&s;e that were found there were Regimented, e|ven the multitude &s;eizing the Keys, and un|dertaking
<PB N="37" REF="24"> with great alacrity to defend it, ha|ving cho&s;e Mr. <HI>George Walker,</HI> Mini&s;ter of an adjacent Village, their Governour, and Major <HI>Baker,</HI> his Co-adjutor, or A&s;&s;i&s;tant-Governour during the Siege. And now tho&s;e in Arms in the Town con&s;i&s;ted of 117 Com|panies, and every Company contained &s;ixty Men, being in all 7020 Common Soldiers, and 341 Officers. The next thing taken in hand, was to view the Stores, and ordering their better Security from any Embezling, as re&s;olving to defend the place to the la&s;t extre|mity, having already rejected the Offers the Enemy made them, in ca&s;e they would readi|ly &s;ubmit, which con&s;i&s;ted of much promi&s;ed Favour and Protection; but the hard dealings others had met with, who had put them&s;elves into their hands, made them deaf to all Pro|po&s;als, and their great Guns being mounted on the Wall, they fired upon the Advance-Guard of the Enemy, who had been promi|&s;ed to be received with open Arms, by <HI>Ha|milton</HI> and others, who undertook to bring o|ver the be&s;ieged, which much con&s;ternated King <HI>James,</HI> then within the reach of their Cannon, and obliged him to remove to a place of more &s;afety.</P>
<P>However, &s;eeing fair Words and Promi&s;es could not gain it, they re&s;olved to reduce it by force, beginning within a day or two after their appearance before it, to break Ground, and run their Trenches, drawing up a Demi|culverine, within a Furlong of the Town, with which they battered the Market-Hou&s;e,
<PB N="38" REF="25"> and did &s;ome damage to other Hou&s;es; but the Cannon from the Town playing among them, did con&s;iderable Execution; and to hinder their nearer approach, the Be&s;ieged &s;al|lied, and beat them out of their Trenches, killing about Two hundred Men, among&s;t whom was the <HI>French</HI> General <HI>Mamow,</HI> and others of Note, with little lo&s;s on our &s;ide, and of Note, only Lieutenant <HI>Mac Phedris</HI> was killed.</P>
<P>The Be&s;iegers finding this way little availed them, drew four Demi-Culverine into an Or|chard adjoyning to the Town, and kept con|tinual Firing, which hurt many People in their Hou&s;es, and made &s;ome Impre&s;&s;ions in the Walls: Nor was the damage left unrequi|ted from the Cannon of the Town, which killed them a great many Men, and &s;ome con&s;iderable Officers, and a &s;udden &s;hot took off two Fryars in their Habits, as they were exhorting the Be&s;ieged to pre&s;s on the Siege.</P>
<P>And now to do their Work more effectu|ally, they placed two Mortar-pieces, and threw in divers Bombs, which did &s;ome damage to the Hou&s;es and People, whereupon the Be|&s;ieged &s;allied, and killed &s;everal of the Enemy at <HI>Benburn-Hill,</HI> lo&s;ing only two of their own and eighteen wounded. The &s;ame day a Shot from the Town broke and di&s;mounted one of their Pieces on the Battery, and killed the Gunner, whereupon they drew a Trench a-cro&s;s <HI>Windmil-hill,</HI> from the Bog to the River, and there rai&s;ed another Battery, li|ning
<PB N="39" REF="25"> the Hedge with Dragoons; but at the &s;ame time the Be&s;ieged &s;allied in a con&s;idera|ble number, and dividing one part, made them Ma&s;ters of the Trenches and advanta|geous Ground, killing about two hundred; whil&s;t the other Party beat the Dragoons from the Hedges. Which reiterated Lo&s;&s;es &s;o enraged the Enemy, that having Captain <HI>Cunningham,</HI> and Lieutenant <HI>Dougla&s;s</HI> upon &s;ome Sallies, they, after Quarter given, put them to the Sword, which &s;erved to confirm the Be&s;ieged in the belief of the Mercy they were to expect if they fell into their hands, and made them more ob&s;tinate in a re&s;olute Defence: and alluring the Governour out, under pretence of Treaty, they fired a hun|dred Shot at him, yet none of them had the power to hurt him, by rea&s;on upon their fir&s;t pre&s;enting, he &s;heltred him behind the ru|ines of an old Hou&s;e, and retired into the Town, cautious how he tru&s;ted them any more.</P>
<P>The Be&s;iegers by this time grown weary of continual Duty, and the danger they were ex|po&s;ed to, drew off their main Body, and en|camped on a Hill about two miles from the Town, yet left it entirely be&s;ieged.</P>
<P>On the Fourth of <HI>June,</HI> a Squadron of Vo|luntier Hor&s;men, who promi&s;ed upon Oath to do great things, &s;upported by a Detach|ment of Foot, made an Attack upon the <HI>Windmil</HI>-work, re&s;olving to force the Line, coming on with loud Shouts and Huzza's; but were fru&s;trated in their Enterprize, be|ing
<PB N="40" REF="26"> beat off with con&s;iderable lo&s;s, Four hun|dred of them were accounted to be killed; and to &s;ecure their Retreat, the Foot car|ried Faggots at their Backs, and tho&s;e that had none, hoi&s;ed the dead Bodies, and car|ried them away on their Backs to dead the &s;hot.</P>
<P>On the part of the Be&s;ieged, the lo&s;s was very incon&s;iderable, only Captain <HI>Butler</HI> pre&s;|&s;ing too eagerly after the Enemy, was taken Pri|&s;oner, and a few killed by a great &s;hot coming over the River.</P>
<P>The&s;e &s;everal Defeats and Di&s;appointments of taking a place they before had thought &s;o ea&s;ie, that the <HI>French</HI> General upon the fir&s;t view, &s;wore he would beat down the Walls with Pot-Guns, &s;o enraged the Enemy, that they were re&s;olved to make all the effort imaginable, and the next night played Bombs, &s;ome of them 273 pounds, which broke up the Streats, beat down &s;everal Hou&s;es, and killed divers Per&s;ons; which occa&s;ioned &s;ome con&s;ternation, and the more when their Stores of Provi&s;ion began to fail, and Famine to encrea&s;e, &s;o that they needs mu&s;t have been di&s;heartned, had they not been encouraged by the di&s;covery of Thirty Sail of Ships in the Lough, which were &s;ent to their Succour from <HI>England,</HI> under the Command of Ma|jor-General <HI>Kirk,</HI> with Provi&s;ion, Men, and Ammunition: But the River being chained up with a floating Boom a cro&s;s it, and Bat|teries of the Enemy on the Bank, he could not only for &s;everal days get up, but had much
<PB N="41" REF="26"> ado to have Communication by Letter; yet the hope of Relief &s;o near at hand, kept up the Spirits of the Be&s;ieged, and encouraged them to a vigorous Defence, though many died daily for want.</P>
<P>Mon&s;ieur <HI>de Ro&s;en</HI> the <HI>French</HI> Mar&s;hal, by this time arrived in the Enemies Camp, and under&s;tanding the little progre&s;s they had made in carrying on the Siege, fell a &s;wearing, <HI>By the Belly of God, he would not only demoli&s;h the Town, but bury the Be&s;ieged in their own Ruins.</HI> But upon the Attacks he made, found no better Succe&s;s than the re&s;t: and the Lord <HI>Clancarty,</HI> who they &s;aid was de&s;ti|ned by an old Prophecy to take the Town, making an Attack, and being beat off with great lo&s;s, Lieutenant-General <HI>Hamilton,</HI> who had fal&s;ified his Tru&s;t to King <HI>William,</HI> and revolted to the Enemy, upon his being &s;ent from <HI>England</HI> to pacifie Matters in the begin|ning, came to make large Offers, but was rejected by the Be&s;ieged with Indignation; nor was <HI>Ro&s;en</HI>'s Promi&s;es and Threats regard|ed. Whereupon he pitched upon a <HI>French</HI> Politick, imagining that would infallibly do, <HI>viz.</HI> he cau&s;ed all the mi&s;erable Prote&s;tants to be gathered out of the Countries round a|bout, and driven half naked and &s;tarved there to peri&s;h, if the Be&s;ieged refu&s;ed to &s;uccour them, who&s;e Wants, though they pierced their Hearts, having very &s;lender Provi&s;ion in the Town, they could not relieve, and there|fore kept the Gates &s;hut again&s;t them, yet fi|red among the Enemies Party that drove
<PB N="42" REF="27"> them, four or five of them fell dead with the Shot. And now there being &s;everal Pri&s;oners in the Town, who had &s;everal Relations of Note and Command in the Enemies Camp, the Governour, and the re&s;t, cau&s;ed a Gal|lows to be &s;et up in the &s;ight of the Enemy, threatning to hang the Pri&s;oners thereon, if tho&s;e mi&s;erable People were not &s;uffered to return to their Habitations, yet leave given them to write to their Friends, to know what they would do on their behalf. <HI>Ro&s;en</HI> return|ed them no An&s;wer; but <HI>Hamilton</HI> returned them a &s;light one. However, this Stratagem prevailed, and the People were permitted to return; which proved advantageous to the Garri&s;on; for among&s;t them five or &s;ix hun|dred poor Starvlings were &s;huffled out, and &s;ome able Bodies taken in.</P>
<P>Another Stratagem they had to &s;hoot Let|ters into the Town in the dead Shell of a Bomb, <HI>viz.</HI> not filled with Powder, as imagi|ning the Governour, and other Superiour Of|ficers kept their Propo&s;als from the Soldiers; but this enraged them the more, and it was made Death &s;o much as to di&s;cour&s;e of a Sur|render. About the Thirtieth of <HI>June,</HI> Major <HI>Baker</HI> died; yet the Defence continued as vi|gorous as ever, and divers Sallies were made, though the Garri&s;on through Famine, Di&s;ea&s;es and Lo&s;s was le&s;&s;ened near one half, and the Famine increa&s;ed &s;o fa&s;t, that Hor&s;e-fle&s;h was &s;old for Eighteen pence the pound, and but little of that to be had: A Quarter of a Dog, that fead upon the dead <HI>Iri&s;h,</HI> at Five &s;hillings
<PB N="43" REF="27"> and &s;ix pence, his Head at half a crown, a Cat at four &s;hillings and &s;ix pence; Rats, Mice, Tallow, Greves, and all noy&s;ome things that could be po&s;&s;ibly eaten, proportionably; &s;o that in the whole Town there was but nine lean Hor&s;es left, and a pint of Meal, and a little Tallow to each Man, when Providence &s;o ordered, whil&s;t they were at their Devo|tions, News came that Ships were making their way up the River; which to their great Joy and Comfort proved true: for Major-Ge|neral <HI>Kirk</HI> having notice that the Town could hold out no longer, ordered the <HI>Mountjoy</HI> and <HI>Phoenix,</HI> and <HI>Mountjoy</HI> guarded by the <HI>Dart|mouth,</HI> to force their way at any hazard, which they did through the Showers of the Enemies Shot, and found the Boom broke; one of them however &s;truck upon a &s;helve, yet the Stock of her Guns &s;et her free again, and they came &s;afe to the Town, bringing Life to a dying People: which the Enemy perceiving, thought it to no purpo&s;e of &s;taying longer before it, lea&s;t they &s;hould receive wor&s;e di&s;grace, but in &s;ome confu&s;ion rai&s;ed their Camp, firing <HI>Culmore,</HI> and divers other Places in their Retreat, breaking for ha&s;te &s;ome of their great Guns; and had a Party of the <HI>Inniskilling</HI>-Men, and &s;ome of the Garri&s;on up|on their Rear, who cut off, or took Pri&s;oners the Straglers, with &s;ome Booty; the former having before defeated Lieutenant-General <HI>Maccarty,</HI> they likewi&s;e threw about twelve Cart-load of Arms into the River for want of Carriages to bear them off; and lo&s;t before
<PB N="44" REF="28"> the Town in a Siege of one hundred and five Days, for &s;o long it la&s;ted, between 18 and 19000 Men, and among them 100 of their be&s;t Officers.</P>
<P>And now pardon me, Reader, for in&s;i&s;ting &s;o long upon this particular, which I could not &s;lightly pa&s;s over, &s;ince (if we con&s;ider the Weakne&s;s of the Place, few of the Men that defended trained up in War, and Scar|city it endured, and the time it held out a|gain&s;t a powerful Army, backed by almo&s;t a whole Kingdom) it may very well compare with the mo&s;t famous Siege that ever was mentioned in Hi&s;tory.</P>
<P>Major-General <HI>Kirk</HI> &s;oon after the&s;e Suc|cours got in, came to <HI>London-Derry,</HI> and was received with all the Demon&s;trations of Joy a People in &s;o ruinous a Condition, could be|&s;tow; and having viewed the Walls and For|tifications, ble&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to think that &s;uch &s;light Works could ever have been defended &s;o long again&s;t &s;uch an Army.</P>
<P>Things in <HI>London-Derry</HI> being &s;ettled as well as the &s;hortne&s;s of time would permit, it was agreed that Mr. <HI>Walter</HI> &s;hould go for <HI>Eng|land,</HI> and pre&s;ent his Maje&s;ty with an Addre&s;s in his own, and the Names of the principal Per&s;ons that had been in the Town during the Siege; where he was very graciou&s;ly recei|ved, and his Maje&s;ty, as a Mark of his Fa|vour, for the &s;ignal Services he had done him, ordered him 5000 pound, and a Promi&s;e of his further Regard. Whil&s;t this Siege la&s;ted, the <HI>Inniskilling</HI>-Men and others of the Prote|&s;tant
<PB N="45" REF="28"> Party abroad were not idle, but a De|tachment of 600 Men were &s;ent under the Cammand of Colonel <HI>Stewart,</HI> got into the I&s;le of <HI>Inch;</HI> and hearing the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> had forti|fied them&s;elves in <HI>Tully,</HI> he &s;ent a commanded Party of &s;ixty Mu&s;quetiers, and beat them out, when more Forces coming to him, he and o|ther Commanders rai&s;ed &s;ome &s;mall Fortifi|cations in the I&s;land, and there &s;uccoured a great many Prote&s;tants who fled from the E|nemy with their Cattel and Sub&s;tance, and others that had been &s;tripped of all, and came naked; beating divers Parties of the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> that attempted to force him from his &s;trength; and the Duke of <HI>Berwick</HI> being &s;ent this way with 1500 Hor&s;e, attempted to force <HI>Ralfamulin,</HI> where a &s;mall Party of our Men quartered; but having timely notice, getting to their Arms, and Barrocading the Street, the Ene|my, after a &s;harp Di&s;pute, drew off with the Lo&s;s of 240 Men; and on our part only Lieutenant <HI>Coningham,</HI> and a few private Sol|diers, and a Lieutenant wounded: However, very de&s;irous to bring the&s;e Parts into Subje|ction, nothing was omitted that Threats or Alurements could effect; but neither of them prevailed again&s;t the &s;tedfa&s;t Loyalty of the Prote&s;tants; they too &s;adly remembred how often they had broke their words, and how little they e&s;teemed keeping it with tho&s;e they termed Hereticks. One fatal In&s;tance of which take for many:</P>
<P>It happened that the Lord <HI>Galmoy</HI> being a|broad with a Party, took Captain <HI>Dixie</HI> pri|&s;oner
<PB N="46" REF="29"> by &s;urprize in his Father's Hou&s;e, which Hou&s;e he &s;et on fire, and with him brought away <HI>Cornet Charlton:</HI> but hearing one <HI>Brian Mac Kinghor Mac Gurrie,</HI> a Captain of the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Army, had been taken by our Men, and was Pri&s;oner at <HI>Cran,</HI> he &s;ent to the Governor of the Ca&s;tle, to offer Captain <HI>Dixie</HI> in Ex|change, vowing upon his Honour, &s;o &s;oon as <HI>Gurrie</HI> came, <HI>Dixie</HI> &s;hould be &s;ent them. This was well accepted, and <HI>Guerrie</HI> was &s;ent, but <HI>Galmoy</HI> thereupon ordered the two Young Gentlemen to be tried by a Council of War, for receiving a Commi&s;&s;ion from <HI>England;</HI> and being &s;entenced, had orders to prepare to die the next day, but in the mean time great Endeavours were u&s;ed, and Promi&s;es made them of Life and Preferment, if they would turn Papi&s;ts, and adhere to King <HI>James.</HI> But they generou&s;ly rejected the Offer, and pre|ferred their Religion before the &s;aving their Lives; and although <HI>Mac Gurrie</HI> interceded mainly for them, and reproached the Lord <HI>Galmoy</HI> with the Stain of his Honour after his &s;olemn Promi&s;e in Writing; yet he would hear nothing on their behalf, but cau&s;ed them to be hanged upon one <HI>Ru&s;&s;el</HI>'s Sign-Po&s;t; whil&s;t he made merry there; and not content with their Lives, he ordered their Heads to be cut off, and to&s;&s;ed to the Soldiers to play at Foot-ball with, which when they had mi&s;|u&s;ed for a time, he cau&s;ed to be &s;et up on the Market-Cro&s;s at <HI>Belturbet.</HI></P>
<P>This made, I &s;ay, the re&s;t more cautious to tru&s;t their Mercy; whereupon the <HI>French</HI>
<PB N="47" REF="29"> General <HI>Ro&s;ne,</HI> re&s;olute to &s;ubdue them, came within the &s;hot of their Cannon to encourage the Soldiers that were gathering in tho&s;e parts again&s;t them, but a &s;hot had &s;poiled his Undertaking, had it not fallen a little too &s;hort, yet it beat up the Stones, which wound|ed him in the Leg, and his Hor&s;e in the Bo|dy, and killed two Troopers, in&s;omuch, that frighted with this Di&s;a&s;ter, he gave over the Attempt: But greater Actions than the&s;e at|tended the Fate of <HI>Ireland;</HI> the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Army &s;o long expected was embarqued, and came on with a fair Wind, being di&s;covered &s;ome Leagues at Sea, by the longing People who watched for it on the &s;hore, and proclaimed its arrival by their loud Shouts and Acclamati|ons of Joy: and on the Thirteenth of <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> 1689.

<P>By this time fifty Sail of Ships came up the Lough, on board which were a Regiment of Hor&s;e, and four of Foot, who joyning the Ar|my, the General marched towards <HI>Belfa&s;t,</HI> and were two miles beyond <HI>Li&s;neygarney</HI> on the 2d of <HI>September,</HI> which made the Enemy retreat

<P>And now that the Ble&s;&s;ing of God might be upon Their Maje&s;ty's Arms, and Judg|ments averted, the General cau&s;ed his Pro|clamation to be publi&s;hed throughout the Camp, and in other places, &s;trictly prohibi|ting Swearing, Cur&s;ing, and Prophanene&s;s in the Officers and Soldiers on pain of Di&s;plea|&s;ure, and &s;uch Puni&s;hments as might be in|flicted, which for a time &s;topped tho&s;e Vol|leys of Oaths and Cur&s;es, that were wont to be heard on every trivial occa&s;ion.</P>

<P>The Enemy beaten out of the Field, our Men too eager of Plunder, entered the Town before they had gained an entire Victory; which the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> perceiving, rallied, and tho&s;e in the Fort &s;allied upon them; &s;o that in the &s;cattered di&s;order they were in, they had been mo&s;tly cut off, had not the Colonel with a Re&s;erve of Two hundred and fifty Foot, and Eighty Hor&s;e ha&s;ted to their re&s;cue, and gi|ven them leave to get to their Arms, and al|though he beat the Salliers into the Fort, and made the others retire; yet the Town being a Magazine, and full of Plunder, he could not get his Men out, till he was forced to fire it about their Ears, whereby great Stores, of Provi&s;ions were con&s;umed; for mo&s;t of the Hou&s;es were filled with Bread, Meal, Oats, and the like, being a Six Months Pro|vi&s;ion for the Garri&s;on: and by this Defeat and the Ruine of the Town, the Duke of <HI>Berwick</HI> was di&s;appointed of his De&s;ign, which by his Orders, was to Po&s;t there with Ten Thou&s;and Men, to be compo&s;ed of a De|tachment of all the Regiments, and &s;o to keep the Country in awe, and make Incur&s;i|ons as he perceived it advantageous.</P>

<PB N="62" REF="37"> at la&s;t, we find that was agreed to be Sur|rendred, and accordingly it was Surrendred, and the Governour <HI>Teague O Regan,</HI> and the Garri&s;on, who had near con&s;umed all their Provi&s;ion, marched out in number 800; they left 17 Pieces of bra&s;s Cannon, 2 Mortars, and a con&s;iderable quantity of Ammunition. And this Place by Nature and Art being ex|ceeding &s;trong, greatly availed to the keeping all that part of the Country in awe.

<P>On this Occa&s;ion likewi&s;e the Clergy of the Churches in the Province of <HI>&V;l&s;ter</HI> pre&s;ent|ed their Addre&s;s, as did the Presbyterians, and tho&s;e of their Per&s;wa&s;ion in the North of the Kingdom.</P>

And here it was that Mr. <HI>Walker,</HI> that &s;o bravely defended <HI>London-Derry,</HI> accompanied with divers of the Clergy, waited upon his Maje&s;ty, and Con|gratulated his happy Arrival in the Kingdom. And Parties were &s;ent out to ob&s;erve the Mo|tions of the Enemy.</P>
<P>The King, intent upon the great Affair he came about, &s;tayed not for many Ceremonies and Complements; but being well refre&s;hed, went to <HI>Hilsbourgh,</HI> and from thence to <HI>Newry,</HI> where a great part of the Army that had been under the General lay, of which he took a view, and ordered all things to the be&s;t Advantage for carrying on the War, nor was the Mea&s;ures taken &s;low in Executing. And now whil&s;t this is doing, let us turn a little towards <HI>Dublin,</HI> and &s;ee how Affairs &s;tand in the Metropolis of the Kingdom.</P>
<P>It was not to be doubted, but upon the King's landing with an Additional Army, the Papi&s;ts would have been more concerned than they were; but I know not upon what fal&s;e Topick they grounded their Hopes, their Concern was not &s;o great, as might have been
<PB N="65" REF="38"> expected from &s;o eminent a Danger; whe|ther it was to abate the Courage of the Pro|te&s;tants, and &s;tartle them into a Mi&s;take of &s;ome private De&s;ign they had again&s;t the King; or that they had &s;ome old Prophe&s;ies, which they too much relied upon for their Succe&s;s; or that they tru&s;ted to the number of their Army, remains doubtful; but how|ever they kept up their Courage beyond ex|pectation. The Prote&s;tants in <HI>Dublin</HI> gue&s;&s;ed it proceeded from the fal&s;e News that 100000 men were ready to ri&s;e in <HI>England,</HI> and re|call King <HI>James,</HI> or declare for a Common|wealth; and that the <HI>French</HI> Fleet being very powerful at Sea, would not fail to intercept the King of <HI>England</HI>'s Return, and &s;o they fancied they had him as it were in a Trap. And indeed in this immergency, the Affronts the Prote&s;tants every where received, without any hope of Redre&s;s, made them not know what to think of their Condition; nor was it long e're the Chief of them were impri&s;oned; and the re&s;t were told, <HI>They would be glad e're long to go to Ma&s;s in a &s;hort time.</HI> And they were put into frequent frights of having their Hou&s;es fired about their Ears, or at the lea&s;t to be plundered of all they had. And it &s;eems it was debated, <HI>That if it came to a Battel, and the</HI> Iri&s;h <HI>were wor&s;ted, the City &s;hould be &s;et on fire, if not the Prote&s;tants ma&s;&s;acred.</HI> But it is &s;aid King <HI>James</HI> oppo|&s;ed it; and on the 16th of <HI>July</HI> marched out of <HI>Dublin,</HI> to joyn with about 5000 Foot &s;ent from <HI>France,</HI> and one Regiment of them be|ing
<PB N="66" REF="39"> <HI>Dutch,</HI> and mo&s;tly Prote&s;tants, great care was taken to keep them from &s;tartling, and the whole <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Army was compo&s;ed of about 40000 men, be&s;ides 15000 that remained in Garri&s;ons, and 6000 of the Militia, under the Command of Colonel <HI>Luttrel</HI> and <HI>Mac Gilli|cuddy,</HI> who was ordered as his A&s;&s;i&s;tant in the Government of the City. And hereupon a ha&s;ty Order came out, that all who walked the Streets without Bayonets or Swords, &s;hould be &s;eized. And thereupon a great many Pro|te&s;tants, who could not get &s;uch Weapons, were taken up, and many of them Impri&s;on|ed. And another Order, That upon pain of Death, not above five Prote&s;tants, be&s;ides the Family, &s;hould meet together: So that the Churches, which had till this time been kept open, were &s;hut up, and Dr. <HI>King</HI> Dean of St. <HI>Patrick</HI>'s impri&s;oned: Yet &s;uch was the Zeal of the Prote&s;tants in the&s;e dangerous times, that they gathered con&s;iderable Con|tributions for the Maintenance of the di&s;po&s;|&s;e&s;t Clergy, and for &s;uch as were Pri&s;oners, till they were forced to de&s;i&s;t; all the Goals and many of the Churches, being crowded with Pri&s;oners, not only Citizens, but &s;uch as had been brought from <HI>Galloway, Kilmainham,</HI> and other places; many of them were &s;tifled by crowding and wanting of Air, and others almo&s;t fami&s;hed for want of Su&s;tenance. It would be too tedious to enumerate all the particular Sufferings of the Prote&s;tants, their frequent Allarms, Fears and many other Di|&s;turbances. Therefore let it &s;uffice, that

<P>The two Armies being now in the Field, the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> however declined fighting all they could; and it was given out, That King <HI>James</HI> de&s;igned to lead them about the Banks of the River <HI>Boyne</HI> to weary out the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> as thinking they could not pa&s;s that Stream, if defended on the other &s;ide; and after he had &s;o done, to cro&s;s the Country and go for <HI>Limerick.</HI> However, lea&s;t the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> &s;hould pu&s;h on, and give him Battel, he re&s;olved to provide for the wor&s;t, and therefore ordered Sir <HI>Patrick Trant,</HI> the fir&s;t Commi&s;&s;ioner of his Revenue, to have &s;hipping ready at <HI>Water|ford</HI> to carry him off, if things came to Ex|tremity; for at la&s;t he found, unle&s;s he aban|doned <HI>Dublin,</HI> which was propo&s;ed to be de|fended, he could not avoid fighting above ten days; for the King of <HI>England,</HI> impatient of delay, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed him&s;elf of almo&s;t all the Pa&s;&s;es and Po&s;ts that were advantageous to bring the Enemy to a Battel; and many Skir|mi&s;hes happened between Parties abroad, wherein our men gained the advantage.</P>
<P>The Enemy by this time being Encamped near <HI>Dundalk,</HI> and &s;trongly guarding a Pa&s;s, call'd <HI>Four-mile-Bridge,</HI> which was very diffi|cult to force, it was re&s;olved that our Army &s;hould march to <HI>Market-hill,</HI> and therefore to fall into the great Road that leads from <HI>Armagh</HI> to <HI>Dundalk;</HI> whereupon Major <HI>Scravenmore</HI> was &s;ent out with a Detachment of 300 Hor&s;e
<PB N="68" REF="40"> and 20 Dragoons, to view the Road and Pa&s;&s;es, and find a convenient place to En|camp in, and di&s;cover, if po&s;&s;ible, the po&s;ture of the Enemy; which was &s;o well performed, that a &s;mall Party of theirs, &s;eeing this De|tachment betimes in the Morning marching towards <HI>Market-hill,</HI> &s;uppo&s;ed it to be the Vauntguard of the whole Army, and there|fore gave the Alarm to their Camp that our Army was almo&s;t upon them, which, with|out &s;ending to know the certainty, put them into &s;uch a fear, that they fired their Camp, and marched away; which being certified to the King, it appeared &s;o &s;trange, that it could not pre&s;ently gain credit: But being in a &s;hort time confirmed from all hands, the order of the March was changed, and a Di|&s;patch &s;ent to the Forces at <HI>Armagh</HI> and <HI>Te|nargee,</HI> that they &s;hould immediately march by the great Road towards <HI>Dundalk.</HI> But a Detachment of 200 Foot and 50 Dragoons going from the <HI>Newry</HI> towards <HI>Dundalk,</HI> were incompa&s;&s;ed by an Ambu&s;h of 500 of the E|nemies Hor&s;e; and though our Men fought de&s;perately, yet above 20 of them were kil|led and wounded, and the Enemy lo&s;t as ma|ny, with the Officer that commanded them, who&s;e Hor&s;es our Men in their Retreat brought away with them.</P>
<P>On the 31th of <HI>June</HI> the King marched ear|ly in the Morning from his Camp at <HI>Ardee</HI> to|wards <HI>Drogheda,</HI> and found the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Army Encamped along the <HI>Boyne</HI> above the Town; but the Foot not coming up before it was late,
<PB N="69" REF="40"> and with them the Artillery; nothing could be done that Night, but vi&s;iting the Po&s;ture of the Enemy, and the Fords of the River, which appeared very difficult to pa&s;s. How|ever, the King Encamped within &s;hot of the Enemies Cannon, which had like to have proved very fatal to the&s;e Kingdoms, by &s;end|ing Death &s;o near a precious Life that is &s;o dear to them; for as his Maje&s;ty was taking a view of their Po&s;ture, a &s;ix pound &s;hot bru&s;hed his &s;houlder, and razed the skin, making a large though not a deep Wound; yet he nothing daunted thereat, only cau&s;ed it to be dre&s;&s;ed, and mounting again, kept on Hor&s;eback for &s;everal hours after; and toward the dusk of the Evening, he commanded Count <HI>Schom|berg,</HI> with the right Wing of the Hor&s;e, two Regiments of Dragoons, and <HI>Trelawney</HI>'s Bri|gade, to take five Field-Pieces, and go early in the Morning to try the Fords &s;ome Miles above the Enemies Camp, and if he found an Opportunity to pa&s;s over and Attack them in the Flank, or oblige them to Decamp. And almo&s;t beyond expectation, he pa&s;&s;ed with good Succe&s;s, beating off 8 Squadrons that &s;tood ready to oppo&s;e him; and having gain|ed firm ground on the other &s;ide the River, drew up his Men in Battalia, &s;ending to ac|quaint the King what he had done, and to receive his further Orders: But the King no &s;ooner received the News, and perceived the Enemy were drawing up to Charge the right Wing, but he cau&s;ed an Attack to be made in three places; the fir&s;t before a &s;mall Vil|lage,
<PB N="70" REF="41"> at a very good Ford; at the Second the Foot waded the middle; and at the Third the Hor&s;e were forced to &s;wim. The <HI>Dutch</HI> Foot-Guards that fir&s;t pa&s;&s;ed over, &s;u&s;tained the &s;hock of the Enemies &s;hot, whil&s;t they were in the Water, not firing till they came up clo&s;e, and then pouring in their Bullets. Tho&s;e that were in the Village, and behind the Ditch|es gave way; but five of the Enemies Bat|talions came up to charge them, before the Third Battalion of that Regiment had pa&s;&s;ed the River, yet ours maintained their ground, and made them retreat in di&s;order, leaving one of their Colours, and many dead men up|on the place; but our men pre&s;&s;ing eagerly on, and advancing beyond the Village, were twice vigorou&s;ly attacked by the Enemies Hor&s;e, but received no great Damage; where|upon the <HI>Dani&s;h</HI> Forces advanced to the left, and the Brigadiers <HI>Melionere</HI> and <HI>Hanmore</HI> came on the Right, one being attacked by the Dragoons, and the other by the Hor&s;e, but neither did any great matter, by rea&s;on they had no Pikes. And now the thundering of the Guns, cla&s;hing of Swords, and the Cries and Shouts made a confu&s;ed noi&s;e; &s;o that the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> trembled at the Din of War.</P>
<P>Duke <HI>Schomberg</HI> having pa&s;&s;ed the River with a few Forces, at what time about thirty Officers, and others of the Enemies Life-Guard, had de&s;perately charged the King's Battalion, and were all killed except Five, and tho&s;e attempting to e&s;cape through the Village, unhappily met with the Duke, who
<PB N="71" REF="41"> in the Firings that were made, received a &s;hot in the Neck, doubtful whether from the Ene|my, or accidentally from his own men, where|upon he fell from his Hor&s;e, and died without &s;peaking in Arms of a <HI>French</HI> Captain, who alighted to relieve him, and as he had been trained up in War almo&s;t from his Youth, &s;o now he ended his days in the Bed of Honour. He received in this Action likewi&s;e two Cuts over the Forehead, but not very con&s;iderable. And the famous Mr. <HI>Walker,</HI> who held out the Siege of <HI>London-Derry,</HI> pa&s;&s;ing the River, re|ceived a &s;hot in his Belly, of which he died &s;oon after, much lamented of all that knew his Vertue and Courage.</P>
<P>The King all this while di&s;charging the part of a great General and a valiant Soldier, was every where at hand to give Orders, and &s;uccour tho&s;e that &s;tood in need, marching with Seventeen Battalions of Foot, and the Hor&s;e he had about him, to inforce tho&s;e Troops that had engaged the Enemy, though they had not much advanced towards the Right Wing; which he did with Nine Squadrons of Hor&s;e, and Twelve Battalions of Foot, and &s;o marched them again&s;t the Enemy; who upon their approach fled, without &s;taying to be charged, retiring in much di&s;order; but our Hor&s;e pre&s;&s;ed on to overtake them in &s;uch ha&s;te, that the Foot could not keep pace with them; they took with them likewi&s;e five &s;mall Field-pieces; and our Dragoons &s;upported by the Hor&s;e, charged the Rear of the flying E|nemy, and killed a great many of them; &s;o
<PB N="72" REF="42"> that for the more &s;peed they threw away their Arms, and what el&s;e was cumber&s;ome; yet finding them&s;elves hard pre&s;&s;ed by &s;o &s;mall a part of our Army, &s;ome of the <HI>French</HI> faced about, and made as if they would &s;tand the Charge; but the King appearing on the Hills with his Troops, they fled fa&s;ter than before, many of them &s;cattering and making their e|&s;capes through the Bogs and narrow Pa&s;&s;es, our Foot pur&s;ued them but to <HI>Duleek,</HI> yet our Hor&s;e had the cha&s;e of them four Miles further, till Night came on, and then the King &s;ent them Orders to return to the Foot, and &s;ent for Tents and Baggage from his Camp at <HI>Drog|heda,</HI> that the weary Soldiers might repo&s;e them&s;elves that Night.</P>
<P>The greate&s;t part of the Enemies Baggage fell into the hands of our Army, as their Cha|riots, Tents, Arms, Cannon, Ammunition, Provi&s;ion, and &s;ome Money; and what was more remarkable, a great many Arms were found laid down in Rank and File, tho&s;e that owned them being run away, without &s;o much as &s;taying to Recover them. About Three thou&s;and were &s;lain, and divers Pri&s;o|ners of Note taken, among&s;t whom was Lieu|tenant-General <HI>Hamilton,</HI> who de&s;erted the King, the Tru&s;t he repo&s;ed in him; yet he was u&s;ed very kindly, notwith&s;tanding his for|mer ingratitude: And upon this Defeat the &s;trong Town of <HI>Drogheda</HI> &s;urrendred, as did many other Places thereabout.</P>
<P>The late King <HI>James,</HI> who had &s;tood at a di&s;tance to view the Fight, as &s;oon as he per|ceived
<PB N="73" REF="42"> his Army in Rout, fled with all &s;peed towards <HI>Dublin,</HI> with a very few Attendants, where he immediately called a Council, and acquainted the Magi&s;trates of the City with the misfortune that had befallen him, declaring never to tru&s;t him&s;elf more at the Head of an <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Army, who would not &s;tand a &s;ingle Charge, and then told tho&s;e about him, they mu&s;t &s;hift for them&s;elves as he intended to do; but &s;trictly commanded the Papi&s;ts not to fire the City, &s;aying, <HI>Though he left it, he did not quit his Claim to it.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>French</HI> Hor&s;e under Mon&s;ieur <HI>Lau|zun,</HI> having &s;tood the hotte&s;t of the Fight a|gain&s;t ours, were extreamly broken and &s;hat|tered; of between Five and Six thou&s;and, there not remaining above Three thou&s;and five hundred. King <HI>James</HI> having &s;lept very ill upon his Lo&s;s, was the next Morning a|larmed with the News that King <HI>William</HI> was on his way to <HI>Dublin;</HI> which put him in|to &s;uch a fear, that accompanied with the Duke of <HI>Berwick,</HI> the Marque&s;s of <HI>Powis,</HI> and &s;ome others, &s;carce giving him&s;elf time for Refre&s;hment, he left the City, and ha&s;ted to <HI>Waterford,</HI> where a Ship lay ready to receive him, and neither &s;lept nor eat till he got out to Sea, and &s;tood away for <HI>France:</HI> where, it &s;eems, he received no extraordinary welcome when the great Lo&s;s and Expence of Trea&s;ures was known.</P>
<P>The Prote&s;tants that were Pri&s;oners in <HI>Dub|lin,</HI> having News of what had happened, got at liberty, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing them&s;elves of the

The King upon this Notice immediately &s;ent thither a Troop of Dragoons, and the next day the Duke of <HI>Or|mond</HI> and Mon&s;ieur <HI>Overkirk</HI> were &s;ent with Nine Troops of Hor&s;e, and joyfully received. Whereupon the Papi&s;ts, e&s;pecially &s;uch as had been over-active in oppre&s;&s;ing the Prote&s;tants, got away with &s;uch things as they could carry either by Land or Water, as fearing to be cal|led to account for their Mi&s;doings: &s;o that they who had a little before tyrannized over the Prote&s;tants, found the Scene changed, and the Stream turned again&s;t them; &s;ome indeed the Rabble had &s;eized, and prevented from Flight; but &s;uch was the Clemency of the King upon his coming to that City, mo&s;t of them were not only &s;et at liberty, but that the Kingdom might be quieted, he publi&s;hed his Declaration in the&s;e words:</P>

<P>Upon this offer of Pardon, a great many of the meaner &s;ort of the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> laid down their Arms, and complied with the Contents of the Declaration, &s;ome going home to their Habitations, and many of tho&s;e that were de|&s;titute of any, took the Service; and things began to carry a Face of Settlement, won|derfully altered from what before it was: So that the People, who a little before were, as it were, in Slavery, and in danger of their Lives, now found them&s;elves at Liber|ty, and utterly freed from tho&s;e Fears that had &s;o long afflicted them.

When in&s;tead of a po&s;itive An&s;wer, he only de&s;ired &s;ix days to con&s;ult <HI>Tyrconnel;</HI> which being refu&s;ed, he declared he would take that time. Whereup|on the Cannon was commanded to be brought and planted again&s;t the Place, in order to a Battery. But on the 26th in the Evening, Sir <HI>Clou&s;ly Shovel</HI> appearing with 16 Frigats, mounted with Guns of con&s;iderable Force, within &s;hot of the Fort, it brought &s;uch a Terrour upon the Garri&s;on, that the Governour wrote to Major-General <HI>Kirk,</HI> that he would accept of the Terms offered; which his Maje&s;ty being made acquainted with, he was plea&s;ed to order, That they &s;hould &s;till have the benefit of the Articles that were at
<PB N="84" REF="48"> fir&s;t propo&s;ed; and the Fort accordingly was Surrendred. After which the King marched towards <HI>Dublin.</HI></P>
<P>During the&s;e Tran&s;actions, divers Parties were abroad, who hindered the &s;cattered <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> from getting together, Reducing &s;ome Ca&s;tles, Forts, and other advantageous For|tre&s;&s;es and Po&s;ts, to their Maje&s;ties Obedi|ence.</P>
<P>His Maje&s;ty now re&s;olving, as is &s;aid, to be&s;iege the &s;trong Town of <HI>Lymerick,</HI> &s;citu|ate on the River <HI>Shannon,</HI> under the &s;helter of which the greate&s;t part of the Enemies ral|lied Forces were retired, being about 25000 &s;trong, Lieutenant-Colonel <HI>Douglas,</HI> who had for &s;ome time blocked up <HI>Athlone,</HI> was order|ed to draw off, and to joyn the Royal Army on its way. The Garri&s;on was compo&s;ed of a mixture of <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Iri&s;h;</HI> they had va|rious Di&s;putes about Surrendring that impor|tant Place upon honourable Terms; but at la&s;t were prevailed with by the Earl of <HI>Tyr|connel</HI> to &s;tand upon their Defence.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t the Army prepared to march to|wards <HI>Lymerick,</HI> and his Maje&s;ty to be pre|&s;ent at that Siege, had put off his intended pa&s;&s;ing over from <HI>England,</HI> 50 of our Dra|goons approaching the Town of <HI>Youghall,</HI> the place &s;urrendred: To bring it to which, the Contrivance was in this manner; The Gar|ri&s;on that marched from <HI>Waterford,</HI> was con|ducted by tho&s;e Dragoons under the command of Captain <HI>Pownal</HI> to <HI>Youghall,</HI> who telling the Governour of the Place, who was the &s;ame
<PB N="85" REF="48"> that Surrendered up <HI>Carickfergus</HI> the precedent Year, the certain Ruin he would bring upon him&s;elf, if he thought of holding out; and thereupon advi&s;ing him to a Surrender: he af|ter &s;ome further Debate, only de&s;ired him to expect his An&s;wer till Ten at night, at which time he privately marched out with Three Companies of Foot, giving the Captain an unexpected po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Town, where he found 14 Guns mounted, and 2 without Car|riages, 350 Barrels of Oats, 215 &s;tone of Wooll, and &s;everal other &s;orts of Provi&s;ions, but neither Powder nor Ball.</P>
<P>The King being thus far on his March, a De&s;erter came out of <HI>Lymerick</HI> to our Camp, and gave Information, <HI>That the</HI> French <HI>had marched out of the Town with eight Field-pieces, and took their way towards</HI> Galloway, <HI>there, if urgeney required it, to be ready for Imbarcation to</HI> France; <HI>and not only tho&s;e in the Town were un&s;ettled and di&s;contented, and that others, di&s;plea&s;ed at</HI> Tyrconnel<HI>'s pro|ceeding, were retired to the Mountains of</HI> Ker|ry; <HI>and &s;uch Fear the Approach of our Army brought upon the Enemy, made them break down the Bridges to retard their March.</HI> How|ever, that hindered but little, for where they found them in that Condition, they forded the Rivers; and that the People might be &s;till a&s;&s;ured of his Maje&s;ty's Clemency towards them, another Declaration was publi&s;hed; and al&s;o that a Ble&s;&s;ing might attend his Arms, a Fa&s;t was proclaimed to be ob&s;erved through all the Provinces of the Kingdom under their
<PB N="86" REF="49"> Maje&s;ty's Obedience on the 15th of <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> and to be ob&s;erved con&s;tantly, during the War, on <HI>Friday</HI> in every Week; which was Religiou&s;ly kept, as well out of a due &s;en&s;e of God's Mercies and Favours already ex|tended towards the late langui&s;hing Kingdom, in a wonderful Deliverance, as what they fur|ther expected.</P>
<P>The Approach of our Forces was no &s;ooner known to <HI>Tyrconnel</HI> and <HI>Lauzun,</HI> but they re|tired further into the Country, leaving Mon|&s;ieur <HI>Boi&s;leau</HI> Governour in the Town, with a very good Garri&s;on, and &s;tore of Provi&s;ion, the <HI>French</HI> retiring under the Walls of <HI>Gallo|way;</HI> but the Inhabitants not liking &s;uch un|friendly Gue&s;t, who &s;ought their Ma&s;ter's In|tere&s;t more than the welfare of <HI>Ireland,</HI> &s;hut their Gates, and denied them Entrance. How|ever, at la&s;t being received into the Town at the In&s;tance of <HI>Tyrconnel</HI> and others, they &s;hew|ed their Re&s;entments by dealing very &s;evere|ly with the Inhabitants; and we had an ac|count that they hanged up two of tho&s;e that were mo&s;t active in oppo&s;ing their Admit|tance.</P>
<P>The Army approaching <HI>Lymerick,</HI> found the Enemy &s;trongly po&s;ted about a Mile from the Town, and that they had lined the Hedg|es, from whence they fired upon our Men, but were &s;oon di&s;lodged, and obliged to fly to their Main-guard; and the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> pa&s;&s;ed the River <HI>Shannon</HI> without any con&s;iderable Re|&s;i&s;tance, the Enemy that guarded the further &s;hoar flying at their approach, and for ha&s;te
<PB N="87" REF="49"> left behind them &s;everal Tents and other Ma|terials, and encamping within the reach of their great Guns, they rai&s;ed Works to &s;ecure them from the &s;hot, though &s;ome were killed by random Bullets. The Army was no &s;oon|er Encamped, and Entrenchers made &s;ome Advance, but the King &s;ent to Summon the Governour to Surrender, withal, offering him very good Conditions, but he utterly refu&s;ed it; returning an&s;wer, <HI>That he was re&s;olved to defend the place to the la&s;t Extremity.</HI> Upon which the Trenches were opened, and the great Guns being on their way to the Camp, Colo|nel <HI>Sarsfield,</HI> with a &s;trong Party, taking a great Compa&s;s, &s;et upon tho&s;e that had them in Charge, and over-powering the Convoy, killed divers of the Waggoners, not &s;paring their Wives, with their Children in their Arms, burning &s;ome of the Waggons and Carriages of the Cannon, Nailing up part of the great Guns, and breaking others. But upon the approach of Captain <HI>Coningham</HI> with a Par|ty of the <HI>Inniskilling</HI>-men, they made a ha&s;ty Retreat; yet the Captain fell in with their Rear, killed &s;ome, took other Pri&s;oners, and recovered a con&s;iderable Booty. So that the&s;e, and other great Guns, being brought to the Camp, <HI>Clonmel,</HI> a &s;mall Fort near <HI>Lymerick,</HI> Surrendred upon Di&s;cretion, and the Garri|&s;on made Pri&s;oners of War. And now the Batteries being rai&s;ed, the Cannons &s;poke <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Language in Thunder again&s;t the Town, and the Trenches were Advanced within 300 Paces of the Wall, and two Re|doubts
<PB N="88" REF="50"> taken, the which, and other Succe&s;&s;es of the like nature, made them Advance to|wards another Redoubt. Whenas Colonel <HI>Douglas</HI> mounting the Guard, and the &s;ign appointed given by firing 8 Guns for Attack|ing it, tho&s;e that were Detached for the Ser|vice being 150, be&s;ides Officers, fell on with extraordinary Bravery, and Entering the Fort, drove out the Enemy, killing about 40, po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed them&s;elves of it, though the Enemy from the Town made a vigorous Sally with Hor&s;e and Foot; and the new Batteries being level|led again&s;t the high Towers, &s;oon laid them in Rubbi&s;h; al&s;o the Bombs and Carka&s;&s;es thrown in &s;et a great many Hou&s;es on fire: So that under the favour of the&s;e Con&s;terna|tions the Enemy were put unto, our Men made their Advances within Thirty Paces of the Ditch, and the Cannon &s;till playing, not only widened the Breach, but beat down part of the Counter&s;carp and Pali&s;ado's; &s;o that an Attack was made on the Counter&s;carp, be|gun by a detached Party of Granadiers, &s;e|conded by other Detachments, who &s;oon gain|ed it; as al&s;o a Fort the Enemy had under the Wall; but in&s;tead of lodging them&s;elves as they were commanded, thinking Fortune was altogether now on their &s;ide, they pu&s;hed on to enter the Breach in pur&s;uit of the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> that ran thither, but the Cannon being turn|ed upon them, charged with Cartridge-&s;hot, the greater part of tho&s;e that were Advanced were cut off, and &s;ome blown up by the &s;pringing of a Mine in the Ditch; &s;o that by
<PB N="89" REF="50"> computation 100 Men were killed and wound|ed, yet they came not off without leaving the Marks of their Valour upon the Enemy. But by this time, the Army having the Elements to contend with, as well as the Enemy, by rea&s;on of the &s;tormy Winds and ince&s;&s;ant Rains, which not only made the River over|flow, but filled the Trenches knee-deep with Water, and would in a &s;hort time, in all probability, have cut off the Communication, and hindered the Forrage from coming in, his Maje&s;ty, upon mature deliberation, thought fit to rai&s;e the Siege, and refer it to a more &s;ea&s;onable opportunity. So that on the 30th of <HI>August</HI> the heavy Cannon and Baggage were &s;ent away, and the next day the Army decamped and marched off in good Order, &s;trong Detachments being &s;ent towards <HI>Cork</HI> and <HI>King&s;ale:</HI> And the King having appointed the Lord Vi&s;count <HI>Sidney</HI> and Sir <HI>Thomas Con|ningsby</HI> Governours of the Kingdom, and &s;et|led the other Affairs, as advantageou&s;ly as might be, &s;ailed for <HI>England,</HI> and landed at <HI>Bri&s;tol,</HI> where, as in other places, he was re|ceived with a general Joy.</P>
<P>Upon the King's departure, the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Gar|ri&s;ons thought them&s;elves &s;afe for the Winter at lea&s;t, but found in a &s;hort time they were deceived, for other mea&s;ures were taken. The <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Fleet had orders to &s;tand away to the Coa&s;t of <HI>Ireland,</HI> and &s;oon arrived in <HI>Cork</HI> Harbour; and upon notice of their Arrival, the Land Forces drew down to joyn them up|on their Landing.</P>
<PB N="90" REF="51">
<P>Upon which the Duke of <HI>Berwick,</HI> who &s;tiled him&s;elf Lord General of <HI>Ireland,</HI> drew off, <HI>Lauzun</HI> and <HI>Tyrconnel</HI> being al|ready gone to <HI>France.</HI> Lieutenant-General <HI>Douglas</HI> followed after the Duke with a &s;trong Party, to fall upon his Rear, but he Encamped &s;o advantagiou&s;ly behind the Bogs, that it was not thought fea&s;ible to attempt the forcing his Camp.</P>
<P>A Battery of 8 Guns was rai&s;ed to hinder the Landing of our Men, but two or three armed Boats forcing a&s;hoar tho&s;e that were to manage and guard the Guns fled, and our men di&s;mounted them, throwing the Carriages in|to the Sea; &s;o that on the 24th of <HI>September,</HI> 5 or 6000 Seamen, Gunners, and Carpenters were detached to be employed in rai&s;ing the Batteries and mounting the Cannon again&s;t the Town of <HI>Cork,</HI> and divers Boats of arm|ed Men were &s;ent to a&s;&s;i&s;t the taking it by water; &s;o that upon the approach of the Army, the Enemy &s;et fire to the Suburbs, and the Earl of <HI>Marlborough,</HI> who commanded the King's Forces in chief, having taken a view of its Scituation, and finding the Enemy had quitted a Po&s;t called <HI>Cats-Fort,</HI> &s;ent a De|tachment to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it, and then advanced his Camp within Mu&s;quet &s;hot of the South-&s;ide of the Town, which occa&s;ioned the Enemy to &s;et fire to the Suburbs, for fear our Soldiers &s;hould lodge them&s;elves in it; yet our Men advanced to the Ruins, and play|ed upon the Old Fort from two Batteries they had rai&s;ed, and the next day made a Breach
<PB N="91" REF="51"> in the Wall &s;o wide, that the Be&s;ieged fearing our Men would Enter by Storm, and dreading the con&s;equences of Delay, they beat a Par|ly, and &s;ent out an Officer to Capitulate, and Ho&s;tages were Exchanged; but the be&s;ieged &s;tanding high upon Terms, four Regiments under the Command of Brigadier <HI>Churchil,</HI> were ordered to get into the I&s;land near the Wall, where the Breach was made, which they performed by fording it to the middle, the Granadiers, commanded by the Lord <HI>Col|che&s;ter,</HI> leading the Van, being expo&s;ed to all the Fire of the Enemy: Among&s;t tho&s;e that attempted this were a great many noble Vo|luntiers, as the Duke of <HI>Grafton,</HI> the Lord <HI>O Brian,</HI> Colonel <HI>Granvil,</HI> Captain <HI>Leighton,</HI> Captain <HI>Cornwal,</HI> Captain <HI>Nevel,</HI> Captain <HI>Fairborn,</HI> and others; but it proved fatal to the Duke, for by a &s;hot he received, he &s;oon after died, and his Body being carried for <HI>England,</HI> was there honourably interred.</P>
<P>The Be&s;ieged finding that our Men would not enter, as not being above 20 Paces from the Breach, beat another Parley, but could have no other Conditions than to be Pri&s;oners of War; to which, with &s;ome difficulty, they agreed, and the Capitulation was &s;igned, which in the Articles was to this purpo&s;e, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P><HI>That upon the Garri&s;ons being received as Pri|&s;oners of War, no prejudice &s;hould be done to the Officers, Soldiers, or Inhabitants, but that the General &s;hould make it his Endeavour to obtain

<P>And the &s;ame Night 200 Men took po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion of the Old Fort, and the next Morning of the Town; the Garri&s;on, between 4 and 5000 being made Pri&s;oners of War; and of note among&s;t them were the Earls of <HI>Clancar|ty</HI> and <HI>Tyrone,</HI> Colonel <HI>Macgillicot</HI> the Gover|nour, and divers others.</P>
<P>This place thus taken and put into tru&s;ty hands, the Army immediately marched to|wards <HI>King&s;ale,</HI> and took their Po&s;ts about the New Fort, whil&s;t Major-General <HI>Teteau</HI> was Commanded with 800 Men to make an At|tack upon the Old Fort; whereupon pa&s;&s;ing the River in Boats, he on the 3d of <HI>October,</HI> gave an A&s;&s;ault, and Entered it by Storm, making at the &s;ame time, to divert the Ene|my, a fal&s;e Attaque; and our Men at one and the &s;ame time giving the Ba&s;tions, &s;ome Barrels of Powder took fire, and de&s;troyed about 50 of the Enemy, and in the heat of Fury many were killed.

<P>The Soldiers being now mo&s;tly in their Winter-Quarters, that they might have good u&s;age, and the Inhabitants of tho&s;e Towns where they were quartered at the &s;ame time receive no damage, the Lords Ju&s;tices thought it nece&s;&s;ary to give their Orders concerning tho&s;e Matters, and accordingly i&s;&s;ued out their Proclamation for regulating the Quarters of the Army, and a&s;certaining the Rates to be allowed for the Soldiers Diet, the Prizes of Provi&s;ions, and the manner how the Inhabi|tants that tru&s;ted them &s;hould be paid for what they delivered out to them.</P>

<P>This, and the diligent &s;earch made after &s;u|&s;pected Per&s;ons, &s;tartled the Caballars and Con&s;pirators in &s;uch a manner, that they ei|ther di&s;per&s;ed or concealed them&s;elves.

<P>During the&s;e Tran&s;actions, tho&s;e Troops we had abroad were not idle, but often marching many Miles into the Enemies Quar|ters, not only beat them from their Po&s;ts, and killed a great many of them; but gave the Villages opportunity to re&s;t in quiet under their Maje&s;ties Protection, and freeing them from tho&s;e Ravagements wherewith before they were di&s;tre&s;&s;ed; &s;o that many, who be|fore &s;tood out for fear of being plundered or de&s;troyed, came in, and joyfully laid hold of the gracious Pardon offered them; &s;o that the face of things &s;eemed to put on a Calm, con|&s;idering the Tempe&s;t that a little before had in a manner disjointed and put them out of Frame.</P>
<P>The Enemies Regular Troops mi&s;&s;ing of the Advantages they expected, now gave way to the Outrages of the Rapperees more than ever, having before a little re&s;trained their In&s;olencies, that the Advantage of Plunder might accrue to them&s;elves; &s;o that they com|mitted many barbarous Murthers in Villages and Loan-hou&s;es, where their Force prevailed, being mainly incited thereto by the revengeful Prie&s;ts, who &s;hared with them in their Booty which made our Troops, though the Sea&s;on was very incommodious for marching, by rea|&s;on

<P>So that now the face of things began to look plea&s;ant; however, though it was in the dead of Winter, our Troops abroad found &s;ome A|ction; for one of our advanced Parties, &s;etting upon the Enemy near <HI>Ca&s;tle-Town,</HI> they killed 22 of them, and took 5 Pri&s;oners, and Colonel <HI>Foulks</HI> gave a con&s;iderable Defeat to about 1500 Rapperees and trained Soldiers, killing many of them, and taking &s;ome Pri&s;oners near the Bogg of <HI>Allen.</HI></P>

<PB N="107" REF="59"> that they froze the Enemies Courage, and &s;oon made them&s;elves Ma&s;ters of it, put|ting mo&s;t they found therein to the Sword, and many of tho&s;e that endeavoured to &s;wim from thence to another Rock, were killed in the Water; and marching thence to <HI>Tralee,</HI> Ge|neral <HI>Sheldon</HI> abandoned it with &s;uch &s;peed, that they had no time to &s;et it on fire, and &s;o it fell entire into our hands; and we having a &s;mall Fort at <HI>Fermoy-Bridge</HI> in the County of <HI>Cork,</HI> the Enemy advanced with about 2000 Hor&s;e and Foot, under the Command of one <HI>Carrol,</HI> who upon his Approach &s;ent to have it Surrendred, Declaring that he knew the &s;trength of the Place, and that it was not tenable. But upon his approach found &s;uch a warm Reception, that after divers firings, he being kill'd upon the place, his Men took, to their heels, and that they might glory of &s;ome|thing, they burnt one Hou&s;e in their return.</P>
<P>Soon after this Defeat, and the routing di|vers Parties of the Rapparees, Colonel <HI>Brewer</HI> and Major <HI>Board</HI> went out with a detached Party of 150 Hor&s;e, and about 200 Foot from <HI>Mullengar,</HI> to relieve <HI>Mare&s;court</HI> and <HI>Mayvore</HI> with Provi&s;ion; and that done, they took their way towards <HI>Ballymore,</HI> and di&s;lodged the Enemy on tho&s;e Pa&s;&s;es, opening and free|ing the Country, and then returned to their Stations, without the lo&s;s of any Men; and &s;oon after this Lieutenant <HI>Taylor</HI> defeated 400 of the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> near <HI>Endery.</HI></P>

<P>And &s;oon after another Proclamation was publi&s;hed on the occa&s;ion of the&s;e Murthers, &s;etting forth,</P>
<Q><P>THat whereas by Examination of divers per&s;ons, it does appear that a Romi&s;h Priest, calling him&s;elf Father <HI>Chri&s;topher Brown,</HI> who has lived many Months in &s;everal places within his Maje&s;ties Juri&s;|diction and Power, without being mole&s;ted on account of his Orders or Religion, has been, if not the fir&s;t Contriver and principal Director and Coun&s;ellor, yet a main Abet|tor and Encourager of the late barbarous Murthers of Their Maje&s;ties Soldiers near this City; and whereas &s;everal others have been found to have been guilty of the &s;aid Murthers, who are fled from Ju&s;tice, their Lord&s;hips do promi&s;e a Reward of Five

<P>This proceeding &s;topped the I&s;&s;ue of Blood that way, and rendred the Soldiers more &s;ecure in their Quarters and other Places where they came, the <HI>Iri&s;h,</HI> for fear of being taken notice of, giving them every where, in the places &s;ub|ject to Their Maje&s;ties, better U&s;age.</P>
<P>About the latter end of <HI>April,</HI> Lieutenant-General <HI>Ginkle</HI> came from <HI>Kilkenny</HI> to <HI>Dublin,</HI> and many of the General Officers, to con&s;ult with the Lords Ju&s;tices about the Affairs of the Campaign, and concert Matters advantageous to their Maje&s;ties Service; and the <HI>Monmouth</HI> Yatch arrived with Money to that purpo&s;e, as likewi&s;e &s;everal Ships with Recruits of Hor&s;e and Foot. So that the Train of Artillery be|ing by this time drawn out, the Soldiers began to draw from their Winter-Quarters nearer <HI>Dublin,</HI> and Waggons and Carriages were provided on all hands, and Parties were &s;ent out to remove the Enemies Po&s;ts, that the Spring being come, the Forage might not be wa&s;tfully de&s;troyed.</P>
<P>Some of Captain <HI>Green</HI>'s Militia Dragoons, marching into the Enemies Quarters, killed divers of the Rapparees, and &s;et fire to the place that harboured them: And Quarter-Ma&s;ter
<PB N="116" REF="64"> <HI>Chalagan</HI> with a Party, beat the Ene|mies Party abroad, took divers Pri&s;oners, and &s;ome of note, with a con&s;iderable Booty; and by lying in the Mari&s;h Fields, a great many of the Enemies be&s;t Hor&s;e died, and their Pro|vi&s;ion grew very &s;canty, which occa&s;ioned ma|ny to de&s;ert, &s;ome going to their Habitations, and others coming over to us, where &s;uch as were able were received.</P>
<P>About the middle of <HI>April,</HI> 1691. one Cap|tain <HI>Fitz-Gerald,</HI> of the Enemies Party, march|ed out with about 700 Men of the &s;tanding Troops, to attack a &s;trong Stone-hou&s;e called <HI>Croghan,</HI> near <HI>Philips-Town,</HI> which although it was guarded only by a Corporal and 8 or 9 Soldiers, made a re&s;olute Defence, killing a|bout 12 of the Enemy, and had done them greater damage, had not their Powder failed, at what time they were con&s;trained to Capi|tulate, and give up the place. However, we were not long behind-hand with them, for on the Fourth of the next Month a &s;mall Party of our Troops was marched by Major <HI>Wood,</HI> from <HI>Mountmelick</HI> to <HI>Ca&s;tle-Cuff,</HI> with 300 Foot, being Detachments of Colonel <HI>Lloyd</HI>'s and the Lord <HI>George Hamilton</HI>'s Regiments, and 50 Hor&s;e of Colonel <HI>Bierly</HI>'s, and dividing his Foot into &s;everal Parties, in order to &s;urprize the Rapparees in the Bogs and Woods, and with his Hor&s;e kept along the skirts of the Bogs, to hinder their getting off, by which means about 70 of them were killed, and a Booty recovered, which he &s;ent away, and a Guard of 30 Men, and in the mean while, with 30 Foot and 34
<PB N="117" REF="64"> Hor&s;e, beyond the <HI>Toger</HI> of <HI>Mallyhone,</HI> when a|bout Ten in the Morning he di&s;covered two Bodies of Men of the Enemies Army, each a|bout 400, marching &s;ilently between the Woods and the Mountains, but when they found our Men had e&s;pied them, they beat up their Drums.</P>
<P>Upon this the Major drew up his Hor&s;e and Foot in a ploughed Field, and bid them Defi|ance; &s;o that the Enemies Granadiers, thinking that our Men, di&s;couraged at their number, would have run, came over the Hedge, but finding they &s;tood firm to expect them, they &s;tood, not advancing any further: In the mean while, a Detachment of the Enemy charged tho&s;e Men on the &s;ide of the Wood that were &s;ent away with the Booty; whereupon the Major wheeled off by the Skirts of the Wood, to &s;uccour them, who defended them&s;elves by firing very briskly on the Enemy, being com|manded by Lieutenant <HI>Ellis,</HI> and having got the Hor&s;e and Foot over the Bog, 80 more of his Men came to him, and thereupon he order|ed the Foot to march in two Divi&s;ions on each &s;ide the River, he marching between them with the Hor&s;e, when being advanced &s;ome|what near the Enemy, and thinking the Hor&s;e might do mo&s;t Service, in taking a Compa&s;s about, and falling on the Rear, wheeled about with an Intention to Surround them, which they perceiving, and at the &s;ame time being pre&s;&s;ed very hardly by the Foot, began to make an orderly Retreat; which the Major percei|ving, broke in upon their Flank with the
<PB N="118" REF="65"> Hor&s;e, which put them to rout and di&s;order, and &s;oon after to open flight, whil&s;t our Hor&s;e and Foot pur&s;ued them through the Woods, and down to the Bogs, killing about 150, and among them Captain <HI>Charles,</HI> and 2 Lieute|nants, taking Pri&s;oners Major <HI>John Fitz-Pa|trick,</HI> who commanded them, and 5 Captains, 9 Lieutenants, and 2 En&s;igns, belonging to the &s;everal Regiments of Colonel <HI>Butler,</HI> Colonel <HI>Robert Grace,</HI> Colonel <HI>Luttrels</HI> Dragoons, Co|lonel <HI>Moor,</HI> and Sir <HI>Maurice Eu&s;tace,</HI> and about 150 private Soldiers, among which were 6 Serjeants, 17 Corporals, an Adjutant-Major, a Chyrurgeon, 3 Drums, and about 150 Mu&s;|quets. Which Victory is to be accounted the more brave and great, becau&s;e the Courage and Re&s;olution of our Men carried it again&s;t &s;uch odds, we having only a Corporal killed, and Adjutant <HI>Robin&s;on,</HI> with two Foot Soldiers and a Trooper wounded.</P>
<P>Nor was this all the Succe&s;s about this time, for 110 Foot, commanded by Captain <HI>Clayton,</HI> being &s;ent for from <HI>Cork</HI> to relieve the Garri|&s;on of <HI>Ballymaggooly;</HI> they were in their march ob&s;erved by a con&s;iderable Body of the Ene|mies Hor&s;e, but they dur&s;t not Attack them; yet tho&s;e that were relieved, marched out a|bout Twelve in the Evening, commanded by Captain <HI>Thorncroft</HI> and Lieutenant <HI>Hays;</HI> and about break of Day they were di&s;covered by about 300 of the Enemies Hor&s;e and and Dra|goons, who it was thought &s;ay in wait for them; as al&s;o a con&s;iderable number of Rap|parees: and our Men being all Foot, thought
<PB N="119" REF="65"> not the open Fields &s;ecure again&s;t the Hor&s;e, but for their better Defence, drew into an old Pound, having a Wall about it Brea&s;t-high; when by this time the Enemies advance Party coming up offered them Quarter; but they an&s;wered only by the firing of their Mu&s;quets; however, all the Enemies Troops being come up, they made many Attacks upon our Men, to force them from their Strength, yet they &s;u&s;tained their firings with little hurt; but in returning it, killed a great many of the Ene|my, who were commanded by Brigadier <HI>Car|rol</HI> and Sir <HI>James Cotton,</HI> which &s;o di&s;couraged them, that after they had offered our Men Quarter upon Surrendring, and it was refu&s;ed, that they marched off, carrying away the wounded and mo&s;t noted of tho&s;e that were killed; yet they left behind them 3 Captains and 10 Troopers &s;lain, and Major <HI>Slingsby</HI> de|&s;perately wounded, which they thought were too near our &s;hot to be carried off; and in all they had between 40 and 50 killed and wounded, and of ours 10 were killed, and 5 wounded, and Major <HI>Slingsby</HI> was carried Pri&s;oner to <HI>Cork.</HI> And much about this time one <HI>Walter Brown,</HI> who had been High-Con|&s;table of the Barrony of <HI>Delwin,</HI> being taken as a Spy, was Executed, and Captain <HI>Palla&s;or,</HI> being abroad with a Party of our Men, con|&s;i&s;ting of about 40 Firelocks of the Army, and 20 of the Militia, was by the &s;ubtil In&s;inuation and Treachery of one <HI>Terence Megral,</HI> drawn into an Ambu&s;h of two of the Enemies Regiments of Foot, and &s;ome Troops of Hor&s;e,

<P>Now great Stores coming daily from <HI>Eng|land,</HI> and a Recruit for our Army every day expected. The time for Action drawing near, the Lords Ju&s;tices (that nothing might be wanting that was conducing to Their Maje|&s;ties Service) cau&s;ed their Proclamation to be publi&s;hed for the Armies better Accommodati|on, the Sub&s;tance being in the following man|ner, <HI>viz.</HI></P>

<P>And that the People whom this War had &s;cat|tered into divers places, leaving many de&s;titute of Habitations, might again be &s;ettled, another Proclamation was i&s;&s;ued out to this effect;</P>

<P>About this time &s;ome other Tran&s;port &s;hips arrived from <HI>England,</HI> and brought a great quantity of all &s;orts of Military Provi&s;ions, and about Twenty thou&s;and Arms, al&s;o Ordinance and Stores; whil&s;t the Enemies great expecta|tion of the like &s;upply from <HI>France</HI> failed them in great mea&s;ure, that King &s;eeming now to grow weary of a War that proved &s;o ex|pen&s;ive to him without profit, and expecting to be &s;harply pre&s;&s;ed this Summer in <HI>Flanders,</HI> by the Confederate Army, under the Com|mand of the King of <HI>England,</HI> &s;ent indeed &s;ome Officers, and a few Clothes, and &s;uch like mat|ters, but &s;eemed frugal in husbanding his Troops for a &s;helter from a Storm he expected nearer home; which did not a little di&s;cou|rage the <HI>Iri&s;h,</HI> and made them again to de&s;ert in numbers: and their falling off had been greater, had not their Prie&s;ts taken them to task, and in&s;inuated how meritorious it was to fight with and de&s;troy Hereticks.</P>
<P>While the&s;e things pa&s;&s;ed, Captain <HI>White</HI> of the Lord <HI>George Hamilton</HI>'s Regiment, detach'd a hundred Men under the Command of Cap|tain <HI>John&s;ton,</HI> who marched to <HI>Belnamona</HI> in <HI>Kings County,</HI> and &s;urprized by break of day two Troops of Dragoons of Brigadier <HI>Clifford</HI>'s,

<P>The Governour of <HI>Clonmel</HI> marching from that place with a Detachment of Hor&s;e, and two Troops of the Militia Dragoons came by Night into the Enemies Quarters, towards <HI>Mi|chael's Town;</HI> but not finding them there, the Rapparees upon his Return fired out of the Wood, which he immediately cau&s;ing to be &s;urrounded, &s;o ferreted them about, that 30 of them, together with <HI>Ca&s;heen</HI> their Ring-Leader or Captain, were killed. And 250 Foot, and 20 Hor&s;e commanded by Lieutenant-Colonel <HI>Hod&s;on,</HI> marching from <HI>Mountmelick,</HI> he po&s;ted them at <HI>Kilkapog</HI> by break of day, where the Foot entred the Woods and Bogs, and the Hor&s;e &s;ecuring the skirts, they hunted out and killed about 18 of the Enemy that lay lurking there to &s;urprize &s;uch as pa&s;&s;ed that way; and indeed the&s;e &s;ort of Enemies were more dan|gerous and cruel where they ma&s;tered, than the Regular Troops, but &s;o cowardly withal, that they would not &s;tand a Charge, if they perceived the Match was but any thing near equal; an In&s;tance of which may be ob&s;erved in this, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P>A Party of Colonel <HI>Brewer</HI>'s Men being up|on their March towards <HI>Kinnegad,</HI> a great Bo|dy of Rapparees lay in Ambu&s;h, yet dur&s;t not come out for fear of being wor&s;ted, though our Men were much inferiour to them in number, but let them pa&s;s; when &s;o it happened, though
<PB N="125" REF="68"> very unfortunately, that a Serjeant and 4 Sol|diers of this Party lagged behind a con&s;idera|ble way; upon the&s;e the Rapparees &s;eized, and though on their knees they begged for Quarter, yet they murthered them, and not &s;atisfied with their Deaths, they bored out their Eyes, and mangled their dead Bodies; but the next day three of the Murtherers were taken and brought to <HI>Mullingar,</HI> where one of them accu&s;ed the other two of the Fact; they were upon &s;uch Conviction immediately hanged up: and Captain <HI>Poyn</HI> &s;oon after falling upon the whole Knot of them with a Party of 110 Men of the Garri&s;on of <HI>Mullingar,</HI> put to the rout, and di&s;per&s;ed throughout the Country, killing between 40 and 50 of them. And now &s;ince we have had occa&s;ion to &s;peak &s;o much of the&s;e Rapparees in the Series of this Hi&s;tory, &s;ome may be inqui&s;itive to know what manner of People they are: To which I an&s;wer,</P>
<P>They are a &s;ort of Vagabonds and Thieves, not caring to Work, or take any Employment upon them; a mixture of <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> with other Na|tions, who herding together, take all opportu|nities, where they are &s;tronge&s;t, to plunder, burn and murther, their hands being again&s;t all, and the hands of all again&s;t them, to de|&s;troy as Bea&s;ts of Prey. They rejoyce at Wars and Troubles, becau&s;e then they have liberty they think to do what they plea&s;e. Their Dwel|lings for the mo&s;t part are Cabins, or moveable Hou&s;es, and their skulking places Bogs, Woods and Mountains. They are not held as Soldi|ers, nor included in the Articles of War, but
<PB N="126" REF="69"> lie at the mercy of tho&s;e that take them, with|out their being obliged to give them any Quar|ter, though they crave it. Their Apparel, un|le&s;s they rig them&s;elves by Plunder, is &s;o mi|&s;erable, that they go in a manner naked.</P>
<P>Yet the&s;e hopeful Sticks, the Commanders of the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Army encourage, and put Weapons into many of their hands, to harre&s;s and de&s;troy the Countries under their Maje&s;ties Obedi|ence.</P>
<P>Yet they have been &s;o often met with upon their Incur&s;ions, that about 4000 of them have come &s;hort home &s;ince this War begun.</P>
<P>And furthermore, to encourage the People to be vigilant, and to di&s;courage &s;uch Rake&s;hames, the Lords Ju&s;tices and Council of <HI>Ireland,</HI> put forth a Proclamation in the&s;e words, or to this effect:</P>

<P>The&s;e Proceedings made many of the Pa|pi&s;ts &s;tir to prevent the mi&s;chief, who before &s;tood laughing in their &s;leeves at the Damages their Prote&s;tant Neighbours &s;u&s;tained, though to curry favour in a di&s;&s;embling manner, they often &s;hewed them a fair Countenance, and &s;eemed to pity their Lo&s;&s;es. And Major <HI>O Neal</HI> and &s;ome others, came over from the E|nemy, and took the advantage of their Maje|&s;ties Protection.</P>
<P>But whil&s;t the&s;e things were tran&s;acting, one <HI>Mark Baggot</HI> apparelling him&s;elf in Wo|mens Clothes, made it his bu&s;ine&s;s to &s;py into our Quarters, and the manner of Affairs; but his too much inqui&s;itivene&s;s di&s;covering him, he was &s;eized, and being &s;entenced by a Court Mar&s;hal, he was executed at <HI>Dublin</HI> on the 20th of <HI>May.</HI></P>
<P>The Sea&s;on thus far in a forwardne&s;s, gave a favourable Invitation to the Army, for their taking the field, when a Party of the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Ar|my, con&s;i&s;ting of 150 Men, thinking to be ear|ly at it, and do &s;ome notable Exploit to be talked on, came to <HI>Ca&s;tle-Lions,</HI> and took thence a few of the poor peoples Cows; but Colonel <HI>Donep</HI> with about 20 <HI>Danes,</HI> and a like number of the Militia, Dragoons pur&s;ued, over|taking them at <HI>Ballyderdawn,</HI> where a Lieu|tenant with 8 <HI>Danes,</HI> and 6 <HI>Dragoons,</HI> beat off
<PB N="129" REF="70"> 60 of them who had lined the Hedges, in which Action the Lieutenant was killed; but the Colonel coming up with his Party, and be|ing reinforced with 50 fre&s;h Men, he &s;till pur|&s;ued them, killing about 50 of them, of which 2 were Commi&s;&s;ion Officers, took 40 Hor&s;es, and his Men got indifferent &s;tore of Plunder.</P>
<P>This was followed with other Succe&s;&s;es of the like nature, nor could any great Actions be expected, by rea&s;on the Armies were not as yet in the field, our &s;taying for the arrival of more Ships from <HI>England;</HI> and the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> upon the like account from <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P>And about the latter end of <HI>May,</HI> 8 Ships with 500 Carriage-Hor&s;es, and other Nece&s;&s;a|ries for the Army came to <HI>Dublin,</HI> and Lieute|nant-General <HI>Scravenmore,</HI> Major-General <HI>Mackay,</HI> and Major-General <HI>Ruvigny</HI> came likewi&s;e on Shoar. And now the Train of Artillery con&s;i&s;ted of 39 Pieces of Cannon, 12 Field-pieces, and 6 Mortars.</P>
<P>And in the mean while the <HI>French</HI> General St. <HI>Ruth</HI> proceeded to model the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Army, and give Commi&s;&s;ions in his Ma&s;ter's Name, ordering things with an Ab&s;olute Power, where their Troops drew together at <HI>Loghera</HI> in <HI>Con|naught.</HI></P>
<P>And in the beginning of <HI>June</HI> all things on our part was in a manner in a readine&s;s, the Soldiers by this time being well recruited of the hard&s;hips, found many of them in their Win|ter Quarters; and being often out in Parties.</P>
<P>The Army indeed lay &s;till longer than the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> expected, which made them promi&s;e
<PB N="130" REF="71"> them&s;elves more &s;ucce&s;s than they were like to meet withal; for the General intending to make a vigorous War, and pu&s;h on for &s;peedy Victory, and the reducing all places that yet held out, and had refu&s;ed to &s;ubmit to their Maje&s;ties Obedience, took care &s;o effectually to provide for all things nece&s;&s;ary for enterpri|zing &s;o great an Undertaking, that nothing might be wanting to retard in the lea&s;t the progre&s;s of their Maje&s;ties Arms; and becau&s;e the Stores laid up the Year before as to For|rage, and other things of that nature, whereby the Army might &s;ub&s;i&s;t in its March, it was prudently taken into Con&s;ideration, that Na|ture &s;hould have time to do her part, in furni&s;h|ing the Earth with &s;uch a &s;ufficiency as might &s;upply what was wanting, if any delays by cro&s;s Accidents &s;hould happen, that &s;o every thing that could be expected might contribute to the &s;udden and effectual reducing the King|dom, and putting an end to &s;o chargeable a War; whereby the Forces upon &s;o happy a Conclu&s;ion, as mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily re&s;tore Peace in the&s;e parts, might be at lei&s;ure to oppo&s;e the grand Di&s;turber of <HI>Europe</HI> in a more &s;en&s;ible manner; &s;eeing it was concluded his main Policy in a&s;&s;i&s;ting the <HI>Iri&s;h,</HI> was only to di|vert tho&s;e Troops he otherwi&s;e could not without rea&s;on expect, would make him an unwelcome Vi&s;it upon his own Frontiers, and joyntly labour to plant the Rightful Monarch in the Field of Golden Lilies.</P>
<P>The&s;e Con&s;iderations, I &s;ay, being of weight, pre&s;aged the unparallel'd Succe&s;s in a great
<PB N="131" REF="71"> mea&s;ure, that attended and crowned them to our wi&s;hes.</P>
<P>The <HI>Iri&s;h,</HI> and the <HI>French</HI> in Confederacy with them, held &s;everal &s;trong Towns; &s;uch as were not thought ea&s;ily to be reduced; as <HI>Ballymore,</HI> the two Towns of <HI>Athlone, Gal|loway</HI> and <HI>Lymerick,</HI> be&s;ides a numerous Ar|my that had already taken the field, and pro|mi&s;ed to them&s;elves great matters from their Valour and Conduct, as now &s;uppo&s;ing them|&s;elves better di&s;ciplined than the Year before; for they had among&s;t them a great many <HI>French</HI> Officers, who laboured to exerci&s;e and train them up in the Arts and Methods u&s;ed in the <HI>French</HI> Army. And indeed, had they had to do with any other Nation but the <HI>Eng|li&s;h,</HI> they might have come off better than they did in the oppo&s;itions they made; but the an|cient <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Valour revived in &s;o &s;hort a War, took again its in&s;uperable vigour, re&s;olving to overcome all Difficulties, and &s;tick at no Dan|ger, but furiou&s;ly pre&s;s on where the lea&s;t glimmering of Victory pre&s;ented, and &s;o like a rapid Torrent forcing the oppo&s;ing Dams, carrying all before it, and Crown their Mo|narchs with &s;prouting Laurels and Triumphs.</P>
<P>But not longer to detain the Reader from matter of Fact, which is mainly the intended Scope of this Hi&s;tory: The Supplies expected from <HI>England</HI> being &s;ea&s;onably arrived, and every thing that was thought nece&s;&s;ary in a readine&s;s, there wanted but Orders to march; which were not delayed; for now, as is &s;aid, the Army being ready to take the field, our
<PB N="132" REF="72"> Forces were commanded to Decamp, and ac|cordingly Decamped from <HI>Mullingar;</HI> and the &s;ame day the Army was joyned by Lieutenant-General <HI>Douglas,</HI> with the Northern Troops, and on the Seventh of <HI>June</HI> came before <HI>Bal|lymore,</HI> &s;eizing upon all the Enemies Out-po&s;ts, which they quitted upon the approach of our Men; but being taken, the Serjeant was hang|ed for firing after the Communication was then cut off between him and the Town.</P>
<P>In the Afternoon a Battery of four Field-pieces was bent again&s;t the Fort, and five Bat|teries were rai&s;ed the Night following, from whence our Cannon rent the Walls and Cur|tains; and the General &s;ent to the Governour to let him know, <HI>That if he and the Garri&s;on would Surrender within two hours, he would &s;ave their Lives, and make them Pri&s;oners of War; if not, they must expect no Quarter.</HI></P>
<P>To which the Governour made no direct An&s;wer; but reply'd, <HI>He hoped to get better Terms.</HI></P>
<P>Our Cannon having made two great Brea|ches, and &s;our Boats brought from <HI>Mullingar,</HI> put into the Water, the fear of a pre&s;ent Storm made the Be&s;ieged hang out a white Flag, and Colonel <HI>Bourk,</HI> with &s;everal Officers, came and &s;ubmitted to the General at di&s;cretion: So that Colonel <HI>Earl</HI> with 400 Men marched in and took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the place; in which there was a Garri&s;on of 780 Soldiers, be&s;ides 259 Rapparees well armed, and about 1000 Women and Children.</P>
<P>In this Action we had 8 Men killed, and the Enemy above 150.</P>
<PB N="133" REF="72">
<P>This important place thus reduced, and the Prince of <HI>Wirtemberg</HI> having joyned the Ar|my with about 12000 Hor&s;e and Foot, the March was directed towards <HI>Athlone.</HI></P>
<P>On the Nineteenth our Men came before the place, where they had put up the <HI>French</HI> Colours in four parts of the Town, to make us believe there were a great many <HI>French</HI> in|garri&s;oned in it: but this hindred not; for by Ten in the Morning a Battery of Ten eighteen Pounders was fini&s;hed; and playing upon the Great Ba&s;tion, in a &s;hort time the Face-flank and Curtain were laid in Rubbi&s;h, and the General ordered the A&s;&s;ault to be made in this order.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t there advanced 300 detach'd Grana|diers.</P>
<P>Then 50 Pioneers with more Faggots.</P>
<P>Then 200 Feu&s;ileers, &s;upported by two Re|giments of Foot.</P>
<P>After them 200 Pioneers with more Faggots.</P>
<P>Then 20 Men with Axes to cut the Barro|cades, if any oppo&s;ed.</P>
<P>So that about Six in the Evening, on the Twentieth of <HI>June,</HI> the Signal was given to fall on, which was the Di&s;charge of all the Cannon in Battery.</P>
<P>At fir&s;t the Enemy &s;eemed re&s;olved to de|fend the Breach; but upon the fir&s;t flight of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Granadoes, they &s;cattered and fled in much confu&s;ion over the Bridge to the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Town on <HI>Connaught</HI> &s;ide, &s;ome leaping into the <HI>Shannon</HI> for ha&s;te, and there peri&s;hed in the Waters.</P>
<PB N="134" REF="73">
<P>Our Men immediately entred the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Town; but lying &s;omewhat open to the Ene|mies &s;hot on the other &s;ide the River, &s;ome few were killed, and others wounded; but the En|gineers &s;oon rai&s;ed Blinds to &s;helter them.</P>
<P>On our part of note, Lieutenant-Colonel <HI>Coar,</HI> and Lieutenant-Colonel <HI>Kirk</HI> of <HI>Villier</HI>'s Regiment were killed, one entring the Breach, and the other &s;urveying the Town from a Hill.</P>
<P>The Siege was carried on again&s;t the other Town with great Re&s;olution; &s;o that having battered it till the Walls and Ca&s;tle were part|ly beat down, and perceiving it &s;aultable, order was then given for the &s;torming of the place.</P>
<P>On the 28th of <HI>June,</HI> about Seven in the Morning, much in the &s;ame order as the for|mer Attack was made, yet the Detachments were greater, as being a &s;tronger place: but before our Men could be in a readine&s;s, a &s;mall part of the Enemy came and &s;et fire to a clo&s;e Gallery laid over the Arch of a Stone-bridge, they had broken down, but were many of them killed in the Attempt; yet it deferred the Attack till the Thirtieth.</P>
<P>However the Cannon and Bombs cea&s;ed not to play, and do terrible Execution, &s;etting the Hou&s;es on fire, and beating down all be|fore them.</P>
<P>About Six in the Afternoon the Signal was given to fall on by ringing the Church-Bell; whereupon they entred the Ford below the Bridge, and pre&s;&s;ed with &s;uch vigour upon the Enemy, that they forced them to quit the Trenches, and within the &s;pace of half an
<PB N="135" REF="73"> hour made them&s;elves Ma&s;ters of all their Outworks, and the Ruins of the Ca&s;tle where they had fortified them&s;elves with Sconces; and Major-General <HI>Maxwell</HI> with 200 Soldi|ers, and divers Officers of note, were made Pri&s;oners.</P>
<P>Yet in the Soldiers over-running the Town in the fir&s;t fury, a great many were killed; in|&s;omuch, 2000 are computed to be &s;lain from the beginning of the Siege, till the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> were entire Ma&s;ters of the Town.</P>
<P>The place was taken in the &s;ight of the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Army, who, when too late, were &s;ending a De|tachment to their Relief. There were found only 6 Pieces of Bra&s;s Cannon, and 2 Mortars, but little &s;tore of Provi&s;ion and Ammunition.</P>
<P>The Principal Officers kill'd of the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> were Brigadier <HI>Mackellicuddy.</HI></P>
<P>The Colonels <HI>Mac Mahon, O Neal, O Gard,</HI> and <HI>Grace.</HI></P>
<P>The Lieutenant-Colonels, <HI>Mac Genis</HI> and <HI>Barnwell,</HI> al&s;o Major <HI>Murray.</HI></P>
<P>The Enemy had all the advantage imagi|nable to Relieve this important Place, as lying with their whole Army on the other &s;ide, but a little di&s;tance from it, where we had no For|ces; or if any, none capable of oppo&s;ing them at that time; yet &s;o infatuated they were, that relying on its &s;trength, they &s;till had a confi|dence that the Town beyond the River would baffle the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Courage, notwith&s;tanding they &s;aw the other Town was taken with a very little re&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>Mon&s;ieur <HI>St. Ruth,</HI> and other of their chief
<PB N="136" REF="74"> Commanders, were reported to be often in it, viewing its Works and Fortifications, and a&s;|&s;ured them&s;elves it would at lea&s;t be a great part of the Summers Work to reduce it, if they were not in the end obliged to draw off from before it; and the rather, becau&s;e &s;ome part of our Army had been before it, and gone off without any con&s;iderable Succe&s;s, or doing any great matters again&s;t the Place.</P>
<P>But their Imaginations an&s;wered not, as it has appeared. Their Expectations, and tho&s;e Supplies, as is &s;aid that they &s;ent, came &s;o un|&s;onably late, that all the advantage they had, was to put a &s;top to our Mens pur&s;uing too far &s;uch as got out of the Town, and fled for &s;helter towards their Army. This &s;en&s;ible Blow greatly damped the Courage and Re&s;o|lution of the Enemy, who before had promi&s;ed to do great things, and made them bethink them&s;elves of taking new mea&s;ures; in&s;omuch that &s;ome took the opportunity, as they found occa&s;ion, to de&s;ert.</P>
<P>The <HI>French</HI> &s;eemed di&s;contented with the weak Re&s;i&s;tance of the <HI>Iri&s;h;</HI> and every thing appeared more and more dreadful to this nu|merous Army.</P>
<P>When &s;everal Con&s;ultations were held what was be&s;t to be done, whether to remove or ex|pect the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> in that Camp; for they could not propo&s;e any thing le&s;s to them&s;elves, than that after this Succe&s;s our Forces would give them a nearer Vi&s;it, and attempt the di&s;lodg|ing them from a place &s;o near a Town newly taken, and now very weak in it &s;elf by Battery.
<PB N="137" REF="74"> And though they talked high, yet in all their Debates it did not, it &s;eems, appear they had any great mind to come to a fight; but rather to delay our Army, till the Sea&s;on &s;hould ad|vance to put a &s;top to any con&s;iderable oppor|tunity, or till they might find &s;ome great ad|vantage to further their purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t the Enemies Con&s;iderations run to this purpo&s;e, our Men were gathering the Plunder of the Place; which was not &s;o con|&s;iderable as in &s;o &s;trong a Town might have been expected; for be&s;ides what had been burnt in the Fires that had happened by throw|ing in of Bombs, and de&s;troyed in the beating down of Hou&s;es, &s;ome of the chief Inhabitants early apprehending this Siege, had removed what was valuable, together with them&s;elves, to di&s;tant places, where they thought them more &s;ecure; though by the way part fell into the hands of the Rapparees, who di&s;tingui&s;hed not between Friend or Foes, where they found opportunity to get Booty. But to come nearer.</P>
<P>The Enemy, after &s;everal Debates, perceiving our Men were ab&s;olute Ma&s;ters of the Place, which was in a manner laid in Rubbi&s;h by the throwing in 600 Bombs, and the force of 1200 great Shot, they came to a Re&s;ult; and it was concluded immediately to rai&s;e their Camp, and march &s;ome Miles further; which they did: and to increa&s;e their number, drew the Garri&s;ons of <HI>Sligo, James-Town,</HI> and <HI>Lanes|borough,</HI> quitting them to tho&s;e that would come and take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as the Walls of <HI>Athlone</HI> were a little
<PB N="138" REF="75"> repaired, the General left a Garri&s;on there un|der the Command of Colonel <HI>Lloyd,</HI> and drew out to ob&s;erve the Enemies motion.</P>
<P>The Enemy, to amuze us, gave out, they were re&s;olved to come to a Battel; when for the &s;upply of our Army, divers Ve&s;&s;els with Ammunition and other Stores, arrived from <HI>England,</HI> and bringing over likewi&s;e the Earl of <HI>Portland</HI>'s Regiment of Hor&s;e, who &s;oon joyn|ed the Army.</P>
<P>It was now re&s;olved to di&s;lodge the Enemy, or oblige them to fight.</P>
<P>Their Maje&s;ties Forces on the Tenth of <HI>Ju|ly</HI> pa&s;&s;ed the River, the Foot over a Bridge of Boats below the Town, and the Hor&s;e over a Stone-bridge that had been repaired for their more advantagious pa&s;&s;age, and marched to <HI>Ballin&s;loe,</HI> a place on the River <HI>Sac.</HI></P>
<P>The Enemy lying three Miles di&s;tant, very advantagiou&s;ly encamped at a place called <HI>Aghrim,</HI> a &s;mall Town, &s;tretching their Left towards <HI>Kilconnel</HI>-Abbey, and their Right up|on the Hills of <HI>Kilcomodon,</HI> having two very difficult Bogs before them, through which the Roads go to <HI>Galloway:</HI> And on the Left was the Ruines of an old Ca&s;tle, where an In|trenchment was made and lined with Mu&s;que|tiers; and on the Right likewi&s;e were &s;everal Retrenchments for the Security of their Camp.</P>
<P>The <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Army pa&s;&s;ed the River <HI>Sac,</HI> the Foot and Artillery over a Stone-bridge, and the Hor&s;e by two Fords, forcing the Out-Guards to retreat, whil&s;t our Left Wing of Hor&s;e advanced beyond the Bog that covered
<PB N="139" REF="75"> the Enemies Right, and made way for the Foot to come in, between them and that.</P>
<P>Our Cannon fired upon the Enemies Guards at the end of the Defile or dirty Lane that leads to <HI>Aghrim,</HI> di&s;lodged them that de|fended it, whil&s;t our Hor&s;e and Foot took their Po&s;ts, pouring in their Shot.</P>
<P>The Enemy drew down a great Body of Hor&s;e towards our Left, and were &s;o &s;trongly po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed behind the high Banks of the Ditches, that they held our Foot in di&s;pute for 2 hours, before they could gain any thing con&s;iderable upon them; but at la&s;t we prevailed, and for|ced them to give way, notwith&s;tanding fre&s;h Recruits of Hor&s;e and Foot were &s;ent to &s;u&s;tain them, as they were pu&s;hed back; and although three Battalions of Foot advanced on the Right, over the Skirts of the Bog, and a &s;mall Rivu|let that di&s;charged it &s;elf into the <HI>Sac,</HI> where in a Corn field others of the Enemies Battalions and Squadrons &s;tood firm to the Charge; yet they notwith&s;tanding maintained their ground, till more of our Regiments and Squadrons ad|vanced to &s;upport them; and then Charging up the Hills where the Enemies Squadrons were po&s;ted, gave them a warm Entertainment.</P>
<P>In the mean time our Left had opportunity to beat the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> from their Ground; and at the &s;ame time the Right pre&s;&s;ing upon them, di&s;ordered them to that degree, that a general Rout of their Hor&s;e en&s;ued; and their Foot thereupon being hotly charged, fell into di&s;or|der; and though they had made a re&s;olute Re&s;i&s;tance, they were obliged to quit the field,
<PB N="140" REF="76"> and were pur&s;ued by our Army four Miles; but then Night coming on, and the difficulty of the ways hindred the further pur&s;uit, it be|ing 6 in the Evening when the Armies enga|ged, and near 9 before they broke and fled.</P>
<P>The Enemies Army was &s;uperiour to ours, con&s;i&s;ting of 20000 Foot, and 8000 Hor&s;e, and had by their Encampment all the advan|tage; yet our Men gained an entire Victory, 7000 of the Enemy being killed upon the place.</P>
<P>Among the &s;lain of note were the Lord <HI>Gal|loway,</HI> Colonel <HI>Moor,</HI> Colonel <HI>Baker,</HI> Colonel <HI>Gourdon,</HI> a great many Captains, Lieutenants, En&s;igns, Cornets, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and more particularly Mon&s;ieur <HI>St. Ruth,</HI> the <HI>French</HI> General, who re|ceived here his Reward for the many Cruel|ties he u&s;ed towards the Prote&s;tants in <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P>Many of note were wounded, of which ma|ny mortally, and &s;oon after died of their Wounds.</P>
<P>About 100 Officers and 500 Soldiers were made Pri&s;oners; and all the Enemies Provi&s;i|on, Tents, Baggage and Cannon fell into the hand of our Men, with a great many Colours and Standards, and mo&s;t of the Arms of the Foot, which to help their &s;peed in flight, they threw away.</P>
<P>This great and entire Victory was obtained with the lo&s;s of 600 Men on our &s;ide; and of note Major-General <HI>Hol&s;table,</HI> Colonel <HI>Mon|gats,</HI> Colonel <HI>Charles Herbert,</HI> Major-General <HI>Petit,</HI> Major <HI>Daveni&s;h,</HI> Major <HI>Colt,</HI> Major <HI>Cornwal,</HI> Major <HI>Fox,</HI> with divers Subalternate Officers.</P>

<P>The Enemy in this flight and total rout &s;cat|tered their Arms and Baggage all the way they fled, thinking as it may be by that means to &s;tay the pur&s;uit: but it availed them little; for &s;uch Trifles were not regarded, in compa|ri&s;on of the Great Work that was in hand, to &s;ubdue and bring the Kingdom under their Maje&s;ties Obedience by an entire Conque&s;t; in&s;omuch, that urged by the Sword behind, and not finding way to e&s;cape through the pre&s;s and throng that was before them, a great many ca&s;t them&s;elves into the Bogs and Water|pla&s;hes, and of the&s;e not very many e&s;caped.</P>
<P>Others that were more nimble of Foot, and had got the &s;tart of the pre&s;s, &s;campered by known ways, and never left running when the pur&s;uit was given over, till they got to the Woods or Mountains, or into &s;uch Bogs where they thought it was impo&s;&s;ible to follow them.</P>
<P>The <HI>French,</HI> who were not &s;o nimble as the <HI>Iri&s;h,</HI> or if they had, yet but very little acquaint|ed with the Country, came mo&s;tly by the wor&s;t on it, where they were broken and &s;cat|tered, throwing away their Arms, and crying for Quarter, which in the heat of the Soldiers fury could not be always obtained.</P>
<P>Some of the Enemies Hor&s;e indeed retreat|ed pretty indifferently, keeping together as well as the Confu&s;ion would permit; but thought it not &s;afe to &s;tay in the Countries

<P>Whil&s;t the&s;e things were employing the E|nemies &s;erious Con&s;ideration, care was taken of our wounded Men; and &s;uch Pri&s;oners as had been &s;ecured, who received very good U&s;age, and what el&s;e was requi&s;ite, till they

<P>But he returned for an&s;wer, <HI>That Mon&s;ieur</HI> U&s;&s;one <HI>the</HI> French <HI>Lieutenant-General, who commanded, was of the &s;ame Opinion with him|&s;elf, and the re&s;t of the Officers; and that they were re&s;olved to defend the place to the la&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>Upon which the Approaches were made, and on the 20th of <HI>July</HI> by break of day, a Fort or Ravelin on the Hill was attacked, and our Granadiers that were ordered for that purpo&s;e, marched with great &s;ilence; in&s;omuch that they were not di&s;covered till they were at the Foot
<PB N="144" REF="78"> of the Glacis, where they delivered their Gra|nado's, and went on to the Palli&s;ado's, entring the Fort.</P>
<P>The Enemy perceiving all was lo&s;t, cried for Quarter, leaving our Men Ma&s;ters of it; &s;o that they &s;trongly retrenched them&s;elves: but hearing that <HI>Baldorick O Donnel</HI> was on his March to throw him&s;elf into <HI>Galloway,</HI> the Wa|ter was bridged over with the Tin Boats, over which pa&s;&s;ed 6 Regiments of our Foot, and 4 Squadrons of Hor&s;e to oppo&s;e his Attempt: &s;o that finding he could not effect his De&s;ign, he retreated into the County of <HI>Mayo,</HI> burning and plundering in his way.</P>
<P>The taking this Fort &s;o Alarm'd the Town, that the Governour de&s;ired a Parley, and leave to &s;end &s;ome Per&s;ons to the General to treat a|bout Articles of Surrender; &s;o that three of their Lieutenant-Colonels came out, and as ma|ny of ours entred the Town, by way of Ho|&s;tage; and after &s;ome debate it was agreed,</P>
<P><HI>That the Town &s;hould be delivered to &s;uch Of|ficers as the General &s;hould appoint; and in the mean time five Ho&s;tages &s;hould be &s;ent for the due performance of the Agreement on the Articles; and all the Outworks of the Town put into the Ge|nerals hands, the Enemy forbearing to fortifie a|ny thing in the mean time; and to withdraw all their Cannon from the Walls; but that our Men might be permitted to work and po&s;t them&s;elves us they &s;aw convenient, provided they came not within three yards of the Wall, or placed any Can|non on the Batteries that &s;hould be made: And that the Garri&s;on and Town&s;men &s;hould have the

<P>Whil&s;t the&s;e things pa&s;&s;ed, Sir <HI>Teague O Re|gan</HI> delivered up <HI>Slego</HI> to Colonel <HI>Mickleburn,</HI> and divers other Places of no con&s;iderable de|fence were Surrendred by others.</P>
<P><HI>Baldarick O Donnel,</HI> who&s;e Succe&s;s an old Prophecy had foretold, fearing by the ill luck he all along had had, it was but a Fable, wil|ling to &s;ubmit with the Men under his Com|mand, &s;ent to de&s;ire a Ce&s;&s;ation on this parti|cular,

<P>Now our Parties being abroad, entred tho&s;e Counties that held out, and brought away great Booties of Cattel, defeating divers of the Enemies Detachments that were abroad, plun|dering the Country.</P>
<P>Upon the approach of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Army to|wards <HI>Lymerick,</HI> the Enemy, who were en|camped near it, no &s;ooner perceived the ad|vanced Parties, but their Foot entred the Town, and their Hor&s;e drew off further into the Country.</P>
<P>And now <HI>Tyrconnel</HI> finding the Thread he had &s;pun grew too fine, and ready to break in &s;under, vexing at the cro&s;ne&s;s of Affairs, fell &s;ick and died, as 'tis reported, of Grief, being buried in <HI>Lymerick,</HI> the place where he died.</P>
<P>On the 11th of <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> our Army marched from <HI>Nenagh</HI> to <HI>Shalley,</HI> about two Miles from the Silver Mines.</P>

<P>From <HI>Carrick</HI> the next day the General went with 1500 Hor&s;e and Dragoons within &s;ight of <HI>Lymerick,</HI> beating in their Out-guards, and taking a view of their Out-works from a Hill that over-look'd the City where our Ar|tillery encamped the la&s;t Year; and upon his being there, &s;everal De&s;erters came over, and confirmed an Account before received, that the Hor&s;e were retired to the other &s;ide of the <HI>Shannon,</HI> and their Foot drawn within the Retrenchments.</P>
<P>Further informing, That upon <HI>Tyrconnel</HI>'s Death, a Commi&s;&s;ion was produced under the late King's hand, which Mr. <HI>Plowden</HI> (former|ly one of the Commi&s;&s;ioners of the Revenue) had brought lately from <HI>France,</HI> impowering Sir <HI>Alexander Fitton,</HI> Sir <HI>Richard Neagle,</HI> and the &s;aid <HI>Plowden,</HI> Ju&s;tices of <HI>Ireland.</HI></P>
<P>And a further Account was given, That di|vers Per&s;ons were &s;eized and made Pri&s;oners in <HI>Lymerick,</HI> by the order of the <HI>French</HI> Gene|ral <HI>&V;&s;&s;one,</HI> for having made &s;ome Propo&s;als in order to a timely Surrender.

<P>On the 16th Sir <HI>John Hanmore</HI> joyned the General with five Regiments of Foot from

<P>The &s;ame day Major-General <HI>La-Fore&s;t</HI> was &s;ent out with a &s;trong Detachment to meet the Cannon, but with &s;ome impatience had been expected from <HI>Athlone,</HI> under the Convoy of Colonel <HI>Loyd</HI>'s Regiment; and though in the mean time a great deal of Rain fell, yet it nothing abated the Courage of the Officers and Soldiers, to go on in pro&s;ecuting the intended Siege of <HI>Lymerick.</HI></P>
<P>To further who&s;e purpo&s;e, a Squadron of <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Ships were in the <HI>Shannon,</HI> who made them&s;elves Ma&s;ters of a <HI>French</HI> Ship of con&s;i|derable Burthen, which had taken in <HI>St. Ruth</HI>'s Hor&s;e and Equipage, in order to carry it for <HI>France;</HI> after which they braved the City of <HI>Lymerick,</HI> by coming almo&s;t within Cannon &s;hot of it.</P>

<P>The <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Army having been &s;ome time retarded at <HI>Carrick-en-Le&s;h,</HI> in expectation of the heavy Cannon, upon its arrival in the Camp, marched on the 25th of <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> nearer to <HI>Lymerick,</HI> and took in divers places by the way, and e&s;pecially tho&s;e near <HI>Lymerick.</HI></P>
<P>In one Fort new built, and Garri&s;on'd with 600 Men, made great &s;hew of Re&s;i&s;tance, yet upon an Attack made by 8 of our Granadiers, after they had fired upon them, killing one of our Men, they made a running Retreat, and by a Covert-way got within their Flank-lines drawn about the Town.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t the Army was preparing for a for|mal Siege, a con&s;iderable Detachment of Foot and Hor&s;e, with &s;ome Cannon, was &s;ent under the Command of the Prince <HI>He&s;&s;e Darm&s;tadt,</HI> to take in <HI>Ca&s;tle Conel,</HI> where the Enemy had a Garri&s;on.</P>
<P>Another Party was &s;ent to take in three o|ther Ca&s;tles which the Enemy had garri&s;on'd on the River below the Town, and enterprized them with good Succe&s;s; yet at the fir&s;t co|ming on of our Army before <HI>Lymerick,</HI> &s;everal Field-pieces and Cannon were planted &s;o ad|vantagious to the Enemy, that playing upon a Regiment of Dragoons, and another of Hor&s;e, they obliged them to draw off to a further di|&s;tance; yet our Men advanced to <HI>Cromwel</HI>'s Fort, which was quitted, as al&s;o was the Line of Communication they had made to the Church, retiring within the Retrenchments that were better &s;ecured by the Cannon of the Town. However, to come into Action, a De|tachment
<PB N="150" REF="81"> of 80 Granadiers were commanded to attack one of their Out-works, which was a new Fort guarded by 600 Men, notwith|&s;tanding upon the approach of our Granadiers, having di&s;charged their Pieces, they fled by a Covered-way into the Town, and left us Ma|&s;ters of the Fort; yet our Men pu&s;hing on, pur&s;ued the Fliers, killing &s;ome, and taking about 20 Pri&s;oners, lo&s;ing but one Man in the Action; and the &s;ame Night Colonel <HI>Donep,</HI> a Commander of the <HI>Dani&s;h</HI> Hor&s;e, was killed by a random &s;hot.</P>
<P>On the 26th of <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> the heavy Cannon and Mortars came up, and our Men began to work on the Lines of Communication, and the next day the Batteries were rai&s;ed again&s;t <HI>Thomond</HI>-Bridge, whil&s;t the Prince <HI>He&s;&s;e Darm|&s;tadt</HI> march'd with a Detachment of Hor&s;e, Foot and Drrgoons, and 3 Pieces of Cannon to attack <HI>Ca&s;tle Connel;</HI> and Lieutenant-Ge|neral <HI>Scravenmore,</HI> with another detach'd Party, marched to <HI>Carrick Gunnel,</HI> which Sur|rendred upon the fir&s;t Summons, the Garri&s;on con&s;i&s;ting of 250 Men, being made Pri&s;oners of War. And our light Frigats with Ammu|nition and Provi&s;ion came to an Anchor with|in &s;ight of <HI>Lymerick;</HI> which the Be&s;ieged ta|king for Succours from <HI>France,</HI> were mainly heightned with Joy; but upon being undecei|ved, were as much dejected.</P>
<P><HI>Ca&s;tle Connel,</HI> a very &s;trong Fortre&s;s, was &s;urrendred to the Prince, and &s;everal other &s;mall Ca&s;tles at divers times, in all which were taken about 900 Pri&s;oners.</P>
<PB N="151" REF="81">
<P>The Siege began by this time very much to &s;treighten <HI>Lymerick,</HI> in&s;omuch that the Be|&s;ieged could not without great difficulty have any con&s;iderable Communication with their Parties abroad; for their Hor&s;e had been re|moved by our &s;hot from their Camp that was under the Cannon of the Town, and obliged to march a great way further; yet they ap|peared very vigilent in guarding the Pa&s;&s;es of the <HI>Shannon,</HI> po&s;ting their Troops upon many of the Fords, and frequently &s;ent their Scouts along the further Bank, to ob&s;erve the motion of our Men, and to give notice to their Main-Guards, if they perceived them about to make an Attempt for pa&s;&s;ing it. However, that little availed, as will by and by appear.</P>
<P>The reducing of <HI>Lymerick</HI> being firmly re|&s;olved, our Men went on vigorou&s;ly with the Works, making a Line of Contravallation with 4 Forts, for the better defending it from any Attack the Enemy might make upon it in their Sallies, and rai&s;ed new Batteries on the Right, almo&s;t in the &s;ame place where the Attack was made upon the place the la&s;t year, the large&s;t of them being within Carbine-&s;hot of the Wall, in a place where it was held not to be extraordinary &s;trong; and indeed the Cannon being mounted, and playing furiou&s;|ly again&s;t it, made the Stones &s;hiver, and with a few Balls rent it in &s;everal places, that the Breaches began to appear at a great di&s;tance, whil&s;t the Bombs thrown into the Town made great havock, &s;o that the Flames of the fired Hou&s;es frequently a&s;cending very dreadful, e|&s;pecially
<PB N="152" REF="82"> when it happened in the Night time, &s;o that it might be di&s;cerned for many Miles round the Country, and divers were killed by the breaking of the Shell, blowing up and beat|ing down of Hou&s;es, and among&s;t tho&s;e that had their lot to fall this way, was the Lady <HI>Dillon,</HI> and a great many were wounded and di&s;abled from the Service; &s;o that according to the report of &s;ome De&s;erters, they began greatly to murmur, e&s;pecially the Militia, who had been forced thither after the Battel of <HI>Aghrim,</HI> complaining that their Wives and Children in their ab&s;ence, were many of them in very great di&s;tre&s;s; and unle&s;s they might have liberty &s;peedily to go and take care of them, they mu&s;t peri&s;h for want: &s;ome of them urged the danger the place was in, and not likely to make a long Re&s;i&s;tance again&s;t &s;o powerful an Army, that had all manner of Recruits and Supplies at hand, as occa&s;ion &s;hould require it; when on the contrary, they were &s;hut up within S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">one Walls, and could rea&s;onably expect none.</P>
<P>However, to di<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;ipate the&s;e Di&s;contents, it was cau&s;ed to be rumored abroad among&s;t the Citizens and Soldiers, that the <HI>French</HI> were &s;peedily expected with large Succours; but when it appeared very difficult to gain Credit, that they could be that way effectually reliev|ed, by rea&s;on we had &s;everal Frigats carrying a con&s;iderable &s;trength of Guns, and Men up|on the River to hinder their coming up that way; likewi&s;e a prevailing and victorious Army in the Field, to ob&s;truct their putting

<P>But he failed them: or had he intended to have &s;ent them home, the difficulty of getting away would have been very great, if not im|po&s;&s;ible, had they not fir&s;t had leave from the General; for it was apprehended they would have thru&s;t out a great many u&s;ele&s;s People to &s;ave their Provi&s;ion, which occa&s;ioned a watch|ful eye upon the Pa&s;&s;es, that few could get away without permi&s;&s;ion; yet &s;ome they thru&s;t into an I&s;land in the River, being mo&s;tly Prote|&s;tants, where they mu&s;t have &s;tarved, had not our Men in compa&s;&s;ion fetched them off.</P>
<P>During this care, and the vigorous carrying on of the Siege, further care was likewi&s;e ta|ken for the &s;uppre&s;&s;ing the Parties abroad; whereupon 300 Hor&s;e and Dragoons were &s;ent to re-inforce tho&s;e that were abroad, and bring into &s;ubjection the &s;mall Garri&s;ons the Enemy yet held out again&s;t their Maje|&s;ties in <HI>Kerry,</HI> and the neighbouring parts; and &s;ix Pieces of Cannon were likewi&s;e order|ed for that Service; &s;o that upon the approach of our Forces, mo&s;t of them Surrendred with|out oppo&s;ition, and all the Country round a|bout became free and open, &s;o that the Coun|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ry People brought in their Provi&s;ions, and o|ther Nece&s;&s;aries, to the great refre&s;hment of our Army; and mea&s;ures were taken for &s;et|ling tho&s;e parts in their Obedience, the People

<P>Our Cannon and Bombs continuing to play again&s;t <HI>Lymerick,</HI> the former beat down thirty Yards of the Wall of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Town on the <HI>North-ea&s;t</HI> &s;ide, di&s;mounting the Enemies Can|non, and laying them in Rubbi&s;h, whil&s;t the latter &s;et fire to three of their Magazines, one of Brandy, and two of Biskets; the Fire la&s;t|ing till Morning, and doing great damage, &s;o that to &s;ave their other Provi&s;ions, they ha&s;tily removed them to more di&s;tant places; and their Hor&s;e that Encamped along the River, being removed by the Guns of our Frigats, encamped between the Town and <HI>Killaloo,</HI> that they might be at hand to defend the Pa&s;|&s;ages of the <HI>Shannon.</HI> And now the General re&s;olving the Army &s;hould pa&s;s the <HI>Shannon,</HI> in order to attack the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Hor&s;e in the County of <HI>Clare,</HI> and to &s;treighten the Town on that &s;ide, the better to conceal the De&s;ign, a &s;hew was made, as if he intended to &s;hip away the heavy Cannon, and quit the &s;mall Ca&s;tles and outward Fortifications; which the Enemy ta|king for his being about to rai&s;e the Siege gave a great &s;hout for Joy. But that Night our Men laid the Pontons over the River, about a Mile above the Town, and early the next Morning the Royal Regiment of Dragoons, with a De|tachment of Hor&s;e and Foot, had pa&s;&s;ed over undi&s;covered by the Enemy; but as &s;oon as Bri|gadier <HI>Clifford,</HI> who lay with 4 Regiments of
<PB N="157" REF="84"> Dragoons to guard the Pa&s;&s;age, perceived our Troops had gained the Banks, he brought down his Men on Foot, their Hor&s;es being at Gra&s;s; but at the fir&s;t Charge they fell into di&s;order, and from that to open flight.</P>
<P>Being pur&s;ued by our Men, a great many of them were killed, &s;ome taken Pri&s;oners in the flight, mo&s;t of them flung away their Arms, and le&s;t their Tents, Baggage, Saddles, Bridles, and other Accoutrements to be divi|ded among&s;t our Men, with 2 Pieces of Can|non, and the Standard of <HI>Maxwel.</HI></P>
<P>The Enemies Hor&s;e that encamped higher near <HI>Killaloo</HI> taking the Alarm, drew out; but it was only to get time to take down their Tents, and cover their Baggage; for as &s;oon as our Troops advanced towards them, and had pa&s;&s;ed the fir&s;t Defile, they ha&s;tily marched away in &s;ome di&s;order towards the Mountains.</P>
<P>On the 15th of <HI>September</HI> the Lord <HI>Lisburn,</HI> as he was quitting the Trenches, was killed with a Cannon Bullet; and the next day Capt. <HI>Taaf</HI> came over from the Enemy, giving an Account, That the Town was almo&s;t ruined with our Bombs and great Guns; and that they had not above ten days Bread for Sub&s;i|&s;tance, the Garri&s;on not con&s;i&s;ting of above 600 able Men.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t the&s;e things were doing, Col. <HI>Michel|burn</HI> marched with a Detachment of his Regi|ment, 500 of the Militia, 2 Troops of Dra|goons, and 6 Field-pieces, encamping at <HI>Drum|chiefle,</HI> and then advancing towards <HI>Slego,</HI> which again was in the Enemies hands, beat
<PB N="158" REF="85"> in their Out-guards, and being joyned by the Lord <HI>Granard,</HI> who a little before had redu|ced the Ca&s;tle of <HI>Balymont,</HI> that Garri&s;om ap|prehen&s;ive of the danger they were in, capitu|lated almo&s;t upon the &s;ame Articles that were allowed to <HI>Galloway,</HI> including in the Capitu|lation the Ca&s;tles of <HI>Bellaby, New-Town,</HI> and <HI>Ca&s;tle-Bourk,</HI> which were to be taken care of, provided they Surrendred within 4 hours af|ter Summons. And hereupon the Fort on the 15th of <HI>September</HI> was delivered up, and 600 Men marched out under the Command of Sir <HI>Teague O Regan,</HI> and left in the place 16 pie|ces of Cannon, and Col. <HI>Michelburn</HI> was con|&s;tituted Governour: And now to return again to <HI>Lymerick.</HI></P>
<P>Whil&s;t the Siege was yet carried vigorou&s;ly on, the General, with Lieutenant-General <HI>Scra|venmore,</HI> being an the other &s;ide of the <HI>Shannon</HI> with 5000 Hor&s;e and Dragoons, and a propor|tionable Detachment of Foot marched into the County of <HI>Clare</HI> with 12 Field-pieces, and 7 or 8 days Provi&s;ion, to oblige the Enemies Hor&s;e to fight, or drive them further from <HI>Lymerick;</HI> whereupon they not only avoided coming to Action, but many of them di&s;per&s;ed and di&s;|banded, &s;o that their number daily le&s;&s;ened.</P>
<P>Brigadier <HI>Levi&s;on</HI> with 250 Hor&s;e and Dra|goons had fallen upon the Enemy in <HI>Kerry,</HI> where they were about 3000 &s;trong, and rout|ed them, killing a great many, and taking di|vers Officers Pri&s;oners; by which means their Maje&s;ties Forces were entire Ma&s;ters of the County: So that the General being now on
<PB N="159" REF="85"> <HI>Clare</HI> &s;ide of <HI>Lymerick</HI> with a &s;trong Body of Hor&s;e, 10 Regiments of Foot, and 14 Pieces of Cannon; the re&s;t of the Army remaining under the Duke of <HI>Wirtemberg</HI> for the Securi|ty of the Works on the other &s;ide, on the 22d of <HI>September</HI> about Noon, our Troops drew up before the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Town, though the Enemies Cannon played upon them all the while from the Ca&s;tle and &s;everal Towers, as al&s;o the &s;mall &s;hot from the Flankers and Outworks.</P>
<P>About four in the Afternoon the General or|dered a Detachment to attack the Fort near <HI>Thomond</HI> Bridge. Whereupon the Enemy &s;ent two great Detachments out of the Town, to &s;upport and defend tho&s;e that were in the Fort: but our Men marched on with &s;uch Courage and Bravery, that notwith&s;tanding this Re|inforcement, they bore down all before them, pur&s;uing with hot Execution the flying Ene|my over the Bridge, and brought &s;uch a Ter|rour upon the City, that Mon&s;ieur <HI>D'&V;&s;&s;on,</HI> the <HI>French</HI> Governour of <HI>Lymerick,</HI> dur&s;t not lower the Draw-Bridge to let in his own Men, dreading lea&s;t ours &s;hould enter with them; &s;o that crouding on the Bridge in great numbers, our Men by perpetually pouring their Vollies of &s;hot among&s;t them, made a mi&s;erable &s;laugh|ter; in&s;omuch, that from the foot of the Bridge to the Draw-bridge, nothing was to be &s;een but heaps of dead Bodies di&s;colouring the Ri|ver with Blood, and 600<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter"> were computed to be killed in this Action, and about 130 taken Pri&s;oners; among&s;t whom was Col. <HI>Skelton,</HI> who being very much hurt, died &s;oon after of
<PB N="160" REF="86"> of his wounds; and our Men during this hot di&s;pute, being very much expo&s;ed to the fire of the Town, were about 300 of them killed and wounded, but none of note.</P>
<P>This re&s;olute Enterpri&s;e of our Men brought &s;uch a Terrour upon the Garri&s;on, that in the Afternoon a Parley was beaten round the Town, and notice was given, that the Peo|ple were very much enraged again&s;t the <HI>French</HI> Governour for &s;uffering &s;o many Men to be cut off, by keeping them out of the City, that they had in&s;ulted, and could hardly be kept from u&s;ing violence.</P>
<P>The beating this Parley was to de&s;ire a Ce&s;&s;ation of Firing and ca&s;ting in Bombs; which was allowed till 9 the next Morning, when the Colonels <HI>Sarsfield</HI> and <HI>Wahop</HI> came out, and de&s;ired the Truce might continue a day longer, and that they might &s;end to the 1500 Hor&s;e commanded by <HI>Sheldon</HI> in the County of <HI>Clare,</HI> to know whether they would be included in the Capitulation; which was al|lowed: And on <HI>Septemb.</HI> 25. Col. <HI>Sheldon,</HI> and &s;ome of his Officers came to our Camp, and had leave given him to go into <HI>Lymerick,</HI> and con&s;ult with the Officers in Garri&s;on; and the next day <HI>Sarsfield</HI> and <HI>Wahop</HI> came out again, and dined with the General, and Ho&s;tages were propo&s;ed to be exchanged, which being conclu|ded on, the L. <HI>Cutts</HI> Sir <HI>David Collier,</HI> Col. <HI>Piper,</HI> and Col. <HI>Tiffany</HI> were &s;ent by the General; and the Town &s;ent out the Lords <HI>We&s;tmeath, Trimel&s;town, Lowth,</HI> and <HI>Evagh;</HI> &s;o that the Ce&s;&s;ation was continued, and the Garri&s;on
<PB N="161" REF="86"> &s;ent out their Propo&s;als; but they were &s;uch as the General could not approve of; and there|fore in&s;tead of an&s;wering them, he &s;ent in twelve Articles which he would allow; and not to be unready to &s;peak his mind in another Language, in ca&s;e the Truce &s;hould be bro|ken by their refu&s;al, he ordered the Cannon and Mortars to remain charged on their Bat|teries, ready to fire upon the fir&s;t Command; which made the Be&s;ieged more rea&s;onable in their Demands: &s;o that the Commi&s;&s;ioners for the Treaty coming forth again the &s;ame day, had a long Conference with tho&s;e ap|pointed to treat with them by the General, and became more moderate.</P>
<P>A very good pro&s;pect of Accommodation pre&s;ented at this time; for we had of their Pri&s;oners taken in the la&s;t Action, 2 Lieute|nant-Colonels, 2 Majors, 9 Captains, 7 Lieu|tenants, and 6 En&s;igns. And this being likely to be a general Treaty for the Settlement of the Kingdom, the Lords Ju&s;tices &s;et forward from <HI>Dublin</HI> to be a&s;&s;i&s;ting at it, and arrived in the Camp the fir&s;t of <HI>October,</HI> and after &s;ome Conferences with the Commi&s;&s;ioners on the part of the Garri&s;on, and their Troops in the County of <HI>Clare,</HI> the Articles of Surrender of the City of <HI>Lymerick,</HI> and the Ca&s;tles of <HI>Clare</HI> and <HI>Ro&s;s,</HI> with all other Places and Ca|&s;tles that were at that time in the hands of the <HI>Iri&s;h,</HI> were on the Third of <HI>October</HI> concluded and agreed on, and &s;igned by the General and Lords Ju&s;tices on the one &s;ide, and by the <HI>French</HI> Governour, and the Per&s;ons deputed by
<PB N="162" REF="87"> the Garri&s;on on the other; and thereupon a Stone-Fort, and one of the Gates way put into the General's hands the &s;ame Evening; and the next day five of our Regiments marched into the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Town, it being among other things agreed, That the <HI>French,</HI> and &s;uch as are willing to go beyond the Seas, may continue in the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Town and the I&s;land, till they can be Tran&s;ported, and Shipping are to be got ready for that purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>And &s;eeing upon the Articles of this Capi|tulation, the quiet and &s;ettlement of the Coun|try con&s;i&s;ted, and upon &s;igning which, it entirely returned to its Obedience, it is re|qui&s;ite the Reader &s;hould not be ignorant at lea&s;t of the Sub&s;tance or Chief Matters con|tained in them: They con&s;i&s;ting in two Parts, Civil and Military.</P>
<P>As for the Civil Part, it gave the Roman Catholicks the Exerci&s;e of their Religion, as far as was con&s;i&s;tent with the Laws of <HI>Ire|land,</HI> and as they enjoyed it in the Reign of King <HI>Charles</HI> the Second, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and to all Per|&s;ons in general that had been in Arms, or o|therwi&s;e under King <HI>James,</HI> except forfeiting Per&s;ons out of the Kingdom, &s;hould be re|po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of what they could ju&s;tly Claim, or were lawfully Entituled to in the Reign of King <HI>Charles</HI> the Second, and at any time &s;ince, by any Law or Laws that were in force in his Reign. And tho&s;e of Trades or Cal|lings to return to them, and Exerci&s;e them as in the Reign of King <HI>James</HI> the Second, on
<PB N="163" REF="87"> condition they took the Oath of Allegiance made by the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Parliament the Fir&s;t Year of their Maje&s;ties Reign.</P>
<P>Merchants, and reputed Merchants, that were beyond the Seas, and had not born Arms &s;ince their Maje&s;ties Declaration of <HI>February</HI> 1689. were included, and to have the &s;ame benefit if they returned within the &s;pace of Eight Months after the Date of the Articles. As al&s;o were &s;everal Officers, <HI>viz.</HI> Colonel <HI>Simon Lutterel,</HI> Captain <HI>Rowland White, Mo|rice Eu&s;tace,</HI> and others who were gone be|yond the Seas, upon the account of their Re|giments remaining in <HI>Ireland,</HI> upon their re|turning in the &s;pace of Eighth Months, and taking the Oath above-mentioned; and tho&s;e compri&s;ed and &s;o &s;ubmitting to the Govern|ment, to have General Pardons of all At|tainders, Trea&s;ons, and other Crimes and Offences again&s;t the Government, commit|ted &s;ince the beginning of the Reign of King <HI>James</HI> the Second. And that all things that have happened &s;ince the War, whereby Troubles, Suits, or Vexations may ari&s;e, &s;hould be pa&s;&s;ed over and indempnified to tho&s;e compri&s;ed in the Articles to the Date thereof, to be mutual and reciprocal on both &s;ides.</P>
<P>Every Nobleman and Gentleman com|pri&s;ed is allowed to ride with a Sword and Ca&s;e of Pi&s;tols, and to have a Gun for the Defence of his Hou&s;e, or for Recreation; and that inhabited the City of <HI>Lymerick,</HI> or other Garri&s;ons, might depart with their Goods,

The Roman Catholicks that &s;ubmit, to take the Oath of Allegiance, and no other. And if any Per&s;on or Per&s;ons, at any time break any of the&s;e Premi&s;&s;es, he &s;hall &s;hall not cau&s;e any other, not concern|ed in &s;uch Breach, to forfeit the benefit of them; and that &s;uch Per&s;ons as are included, &s;hall have the favour of the Lords Ju&s;tices and General, to u&s;e their Endeavours to have them protected from Arre&s;ts, Execution, Debts and Damages for the &s;pace of Eight Months. That Provi&s;ion be made to enable Colonel <HI>John Brown,</HI> by re&s;toring &s;o much of his E&s;tate and Effects as were taken away, to pay his Debts: The Matter to be &s;tated, and agreed, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>Thus things proceeded of this kind advan|tageous for the quieting of the Minds of the People, and &s;ettling in Peace and Tranqui|lity.</P>
<P>As for the Military Articles, the Sub&s;tance of them were:</P>
<P>That any Per&s;ons willing to leave the Kingdom, might pa&s;s with their Goods and Families, except into <HI>England, Scotland;</HI> and for the Officers and Soldiers, and tho&s;e called Rapparees, that are minded to go, Ships &s;hould be prepared to tran&s;port them, and days and places appointed for tho&s;e that were

<P>This being briefly the Heads and Sub|&s;tance of the&s;e famous Articles, I &s;hall now proceed to what en&s;ued upon &s;o happy a Juncture, in which the Nation had &s;o great a Promi&s;e of Peace and Tranquility, which has &s;ince rai&s;ed its drooping Head from the Du&s;t.</P>
<PB N="168" REF="90">
<P>About the time of this Agreement, News came that divers <HI>French</HI> Men of War, with Tran&s;port-Ships, were on the Coa&s;t, and en|deavoured to put into &s;ome places, though very di&s;tant from <HI>Lymerick;</HI> but either not well knowing the Harbours, or being fearful, as having no certainty of what had happened, they continued cruizing, being &s;een &s;ometimes off one place, and at other times off another, as being doubtful and uncertain of their enter|prizing any thing to the end for which they came; as perhaps, having intelligence that a Squadron of our Men of War, under the Com|mand of Sir <HI>Ralph Delaval,</HI> was making to|wards <HI>Ireland,</HI> to prevent any evil de&s;ign they might have, notwith&s;tanding the Capitulation, con&s;idering on our part, that the <HI>French</HI> Maxim is much the &s;ame with that of the <HI>Ottomon Port, viz,</HI> To con&s;ider nothing again&s;t their Intere&s;t; but in the firme&s;t Peace to take all the advan|tages of open Ho&s;tility, where any thing of|fers that may render their Attempts &s;ucce&s;sful. But whether they &s;ooner or latter had an ac|count of what had happened at <HI>Lymerick,</HI> and that with the rendering up that important place, all their Mea&s;ures had been broken, con&s;idering in tho&s;e Articles, the few places of no con&s;iderable &s;trength were included, we de|termine not; but certainly &s;o it happened, they attempted nothing worthy of note on the Coa&s;t of that Kingdom, but kept out at Sea as well as they could.</P>
<PB N="169" REF="90">
<P>During the cruizing of the <HI>French,</HI> we had at length certain knowledge that they had no|tice of what had happened, <HI>viz.</HI> that <HI>Lymerick</HI> had &s;ubmitted, and with it all tho&s;e Places that yet held out, if in the time limited, they, by Surrendring, took the benefit of the Arti|cles agreed on, which occa&s;ioned a greater Security in them, as to the fear of being at|tacked by our Men of War; becau&s;e in one of the Articles it was agreed, that &s;uch of the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> and <HI>French</HI> as had a mind to leave the King|dom, and go for <HI>France,</HI> might &s;tay to expect a free Pa&s;&s;age thither, without interruption, and then they more boldly appeared upon the Coa&s;t of <HI>Kerry,</HI> being di&s;cerned from the Hills and Cliffs, to be about 25 Sail of Men of War, with &s;ome Fire-&s;hips, and 25 Tran&s;port-&s;hips, and that it might be taken, that their de&s;ign in coming at fir&s;t, was no other than to carry off the <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> that were unwilling to &s;tay, Mon&s;ieur <HI>D'&V;&s;&s;on,</HI> the late <HI>French</HI> Go|vernour, took his fir&s;t opportunity to give no|tice of their being there to Major-General <HI>Tal|ma&s;h,</HI> who had been appointed by the Gene|ral to Command at <HI>Lymerick;</HI> and upon ma|ture deliberation, it being thought more con|venient to &s;uffer &s;uch as would tran&s;port them|&s;elves in <HI>French</HI> Ships, than tru&s;t any of ours in the Enemies Port on that Account, at la&s;t it was agreed, that the Tran&s;port|&s;hips might come into the River <HI>Shannon;</HI> but the Men of War and Fire&s;hips to keep out at Sea; and that tho&s;e Tran&s;port-&s;hips

<P>Although <HI>Sarsfield, Sheldon,</HI> and others, who centered their Fortunes and Intere&s;t in the late King, who had mainly rai&s;ed them by his Favours, expected to draw after the greater part of the Di&s;ciplined Soldiers to be di&s;po&s;ed of in the Service of the <HI>French</HI> King, as al&s;o &s;ome of the Gentry and Nobility; yet they mi&s;&s;ed of their aim.</P>

<P>His Maje&s;ties Birth-day and the Anniver|&s;ary of the Powder-Plot, were likewi&s;e ob|&s;erved with all imaginable Demon&s;trations of Loyalty, and Marks of Firmne&s;s to the Pro|te&s;tant Religion.</P>
<P>Nor were &s;ome of the Papi&s;ts wanting to expre&s;s their Satisfaction to &s;ee the Hero, who had been &s;o mainly In&s;trumental in re|&s;toring them that Peace they had &s;o ra&s;hly forfeited; and had lei&s;ure during almo&s;t a three Years, to repent of the trouble they had given the Kingdom, and of the Lo&s;&s;es them|&s;elves &s;u&s;tained.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t this Joy la&s;ted, care was taken to order the Garri&s;ons, and provide them with &s;uch Nece&s;&s;aries where they were wanting, as might &s;erve for the Winter Stores, and put the Soldiers in a good plight.

<P>On the Fir&s;t of <HI>November</HI> following the&s;e Tran&s;actions, the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Entirely left the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Town of <HI>Lymerick,</HI> Embarking on the Tran&s;port-&s;hips in the <HI>Shannon;</HI> when Sailing for <HI>France,</HI> one of tho&s;e Ships ha|ving on Board Four hundred Men, be&s;ides Stores and Furnitures of divers kinds, run|ning foul on a Rock over&s;et, and about One hundred Men were drowned, though no diligence was wanting to endeavour their pre&s;ervation.</P>
<P>Upon the marching out of the <HI>Iri&s;h,</HI> our Soldiers marched in, and Garri&s;oned the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Town, and now Sir <HI>David Collier</HI> was made Governour of the City of <HI>Ly|merick,</HI> and the Lord <HI>O Brian</HI> of the County of the &s;aid City. And on the Sixth of this Month the <HI>French</HI> Squadron, con|&s;i&s;ting of Eighteen Men of War, Six Fire|&s;hips,

<P>Upon this great turn of Fortune, many of their Ringleaders going away in the <HI>French</HI> Ships, the Rapparees found them|&s;elves abandoned, and in great Di&s;tre&s;s, &s;o that they were con&s;trained to come in and &s;ubmit; &s;o that the face of things appeared to be &s;trangely changed, Uproar and Con|fu&s;ion being turned into a calm Peace; &s;o that mo&s;t of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and <HI>Dutch</HI> Regi|ments, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> prepared to Embark for <HI>Eng|land,</HI> where they &s;oon after Arrived, and pa&s;&s;ed for <HI>Flanders,</HI> where they were for the Winter Sea&s;on quartered advantagiou|ly in divers Towns, to hinder the Incur&s;i|ons of the <HI>French.</HI></P>

<P>The General having put an end to the War of <HI>Ireland,</HI> being highly care&s;&s;ed and treated in <HI>Dublin,</HI> Embarked for <HI>England</HI> on the <HI>Monmouth</HI> Yatch, where he received the Applau&s;e and high Commendations of the People in all places where he pa&s;&s;ed.

<P>The Soldiers now returning, a Proclama|tion was I&s;&s;ued forth for their well abear|ing and behaving them&s;elves in their March, Quarters, and making due Payment.

<P>On the Two and twentieth of <HI>December, Sarsfield</HI> having got together Two thou&s;and &s;ix hundred Men, Women and Children, &s;et Sail from <HI>Cork</HI> for <HI>France:</HI> he thought to have carried a greater Number, but was de|ceived by their De&s;erting him; as did the whole Regiments of <HI>Mac Dermo, Brian O Neal,</HI> and Colonel <HI>Felix O Neal,</HI> upon the Advice they received of the ill Treatment of the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> that were already Landed in <HI>France,</HI> where the Officers were generally di&s;placed, or made to &s;erve in lower Sta|tions, even to Common Soldiers, and <HI>French</HI> Men &s;et over them.</P>
<P><HI>Ireland</HI> being now in a fair way to a Set|tlement, Colonel <HI>Foulk,</HI> Governour of <HI>Dub|lin,</HI> had Orders to Disband the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Regi|ments that came over to us upon the Sur|render of <HI>Lymerick,</HI> except Fourteen hun|dred which were appointed for the Empe|rour's Service; the which, though they profe&s;&s;ed a great willingne&s;s to &s;erve their Maje&s;ties, they &s;ubmitted to, and had Two Cobs a Man given them <HI>Gratis,</HI> mo&s;t of

<P>On the Three and twentieth of <HI>January,</HI> being the fir&s;t day of the Term, the Right Honourable Sir <HI>Charles Porter,</HI> Lord Chan|cellour, and <HI>Thomas Conningsby</HI> E&s;quire, Lords Ju&s;tices of the Kingdom, came to the Court of <HI>Kings Bench,</HI> accompanied by di|vers of the Privy Council, and other Per|&s;ons of Quality; where they took the Oaths, and Sub&s;cribed the Declaration required by the late Act of Parliament made in <HI>England:</HI> After which the Judges of other Courts, and Per&s;ons of different Quality and Employments did the like.</P>
<P>About this time there happened an Ex|traordinary Storm, which did much Da|mage at Land, but more by Sea: The <HI>Adventure of London</HI> was ca&s;t away on the Coa&s;t, and all her Men drowned. A Ve&s;|&s;el laden with Corn was driven from her Anchor in the Road, and beaten to pieces, but her Men &s;aved, and divers other Ship|wracks were driven on &s;hoar in the Ports of this Kingdom.</P>
<P>And now the Poor being very numerous, by rea&s;on of Lo&s;&s;es in the War, care was ordered every where to be taken of them till they could better provide for them|&s;elves, having convenient Hou&s;es appoint|ed
<PB N="180" REF="96"> for their &s;helter. And the Militia of the Country was reviewed, to know in what Condition it &s;tood.

<P>This &s;aved a great many Officers and Soldiers much Money, who to &s;upply pre|&s;ant need, would have taken a &s;mall mat|ter for what was after paid them to the full.

<P>This made a great many of the Papi&s;ts bring in their Arms, for fear of a Di&s;co|very, which they had kept till now per|haps to &s;o &s;ini&s;ter an end: &s;o that by this means the Peace being better a&s;&s;ured, the Prote&s;tants found them&s;elves out of dan|ger; the Husbandmen manured their Ground with cheerfulne&s;s, as not doubting to reap the benefit of their Labours, which they had been long debarr'd, to the undoing of many Thou&s;ands.

<P>On the 17th. they came before the Place, and found the Shores guarded with Numerous Troops; the Wind blew very hard, but the next Day toward the Eve|ning the Weather was calm, and the Bomb-Ve&s;&s;els warped in as near as they could to the Town, being covered by a great many Boats, Manned with Sea-men and Soldiers. The Enemy fired all the while from their Batteries on the Shore, without doing us any damage. The Night was &s;pent in throwing in about 250 Bombs, and more had been fired, but that the Wind grew very high, which obliged our Ve&s;&s;els to &s;tand off again in the Morning; in the Night &s;everal Fires were &s;een in the Town, and one particularly, which by the great Blaze and long continuance, was &s;uppo&s;ed to be a Magazine of New Stores; and though the Enemy &s;unk 6 Ships in the Harbour, to ob&s;truct our nearer approach, yet above a third part of the Town was

<P>The King having endeavoured by the often removal of his Camp in <HI>Flanders,</HI> to oblige the <HI>French</HI> to a Battel, or to gain upon them, and they endeavouring all they could to &s;hun it; there only happen|ing &s;ome Skirmi&s;hes between advanced and detached Parties, he cau&s;ed <HI>Huy</HI> to be Be&s;ieged, which, with little re&s;i&s;tance, he took, and Garri&s;oned it with a &s;trong Garri&s;on, &s;till advancing and gaining upon the Enemy, who quitted &s;ome of the Lines and Out-works; &s;o that this Sum|mer our Quarters are much inlarged in tho&s;e Countries, by taking in a great many Villages and Important Po&s;ts.</P>
