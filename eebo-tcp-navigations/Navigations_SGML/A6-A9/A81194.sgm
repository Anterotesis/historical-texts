<HEAD>THE PREFACE. TO THE READER.</HEAD>
<P>AT my fir&s;t Entrance into the Study of the Laws of <HI>England,</HI> knowing Method and Order conduce much to the enlightning of the &V;nder&s;tanding, rendring things more per&s;picuous, and comprehen&s;ive to the di&s;cerning Judgment, and &s;itting them better for the retaining Memory; I re&s;olved to ob&s;erve a Regular Cour&s;e, and therefore &s;earched for &s;uch Au|thors, and endeavoured to make u&s;e of &s;uch Means as might be&s;t corre&s;pond with my De&s;ign therein. But among the &s;everal Treati&s;es of the Laws and Government of this Kingdom, and Ju|ri&s;diction of Courts heretofore written by &s;everal Eminent and Learned Men, finding none were &s;o compleat, nor had that
<PB REF="3"> Beauty of Order and &V;niformity at might be expected. And the Lord-<HI>Coke</HI> in the Epilogue to his Fourth In&s;titutets concerning the Juri&s;diction of Courts, de&s;iring the Wi&s;e-hearted and Expert Builders would amend both the Method, and &V;niformity, and the Structure it &s;elf, where they &s;hould find any Deficiency in the Architecture; and con&s;idering that great Alterations have been made &s;ince by divers Acts of Parliament and otherwi&s;e, I was enduced to compile this. Methodical <HI>Compendium of the Laws and Go|vernment of</HI> England, <HI>and the Domi|nions thereunto belonging,</HI> to direct and facilitate my farther Studies. But the Importunity of &s;ome having pre|vailed with me to promi&s;e (contrary to my fir&s;t Intention and Inclination) to make it Publick: If it prove bene|ficial to others, it will &s;urmount all the Ambition may be thought to be in</P>

<HEAD>The Original of Governments.</HEAD>
<P>OF GOVERNMENTS there can be but Three kinds, <HI>viz.</HI> One, or More, or All, mu&s;t have the Sovereign Power of a Nation: If one, then it is a <HI>Monar|chy;</HI> If more, (as an A&s;&s;embly of Choice Per&s;ons) then it is <HI>Ari&s;tocracy;</HI> if All (that is, a General A&s;&s;embly of the People,) then it is a <HI>Democracy:</HI> And now in cour&s;e we are fir&s;t to &s;peak of,</P>
<P>The <HI>Monarchical Government,</HI> which as mo&s;t re&s;embling the Divinity, and approaching neare&s;t to Perfection, be|ing e&s;teemed the mo&s;t Excellent, is of two &s;orts, <HI>Regal</HI> and <HI>Political:</HI> The fir&s;t &s;ort,</P>
<P><HI>Monarchy Regal</HI> was begun by <HI>Nim|rod,</HI> who (after the World began to increa&s;e) got unto him&s;elf a Dominion
<PB N="2" REF="9">over others; and yet in Scripture he is not called a King, but a <HI>Mighty Hunter before the Lord:</HI> So <HI>Belus</HI> did &s;ubdue the <HI>A&s;&s;yrians,</HI> and <HI>Ninus</HI> the mo&s;t part of <HI>A&s;ia;</HI> and &s;o did the <HI>Romans</HI> u&s;urp the Empire of the World.</P>
<P>And thus having &s;et forth the begin|ning of the <HI>Regal Government</HI> of King|doms; which Law <HI>Regal</HI> was no other thing but the Plea&s;ure of the Prince, as in the Fir&s;t of <HI>Kings</HI> you may read more at large: We will now, as being more for our purpo&s;e, declare how King|doms of <HI>Political Government</HI> were fir&s;t begun, which we may term,</P>
<P><HI>Monarchy Political.</HI> St. <HI>Augu&s;tine</HI> in the 19th Book <HI>De Civitate Dei,</HI> &s;aith, <HI>A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter"> People is a Multitude of Men a&s;&s;ociated by the Con&s;ent of Law, and Communion of Wealth:</HI> And yet &s;uch a People without a Head, is not worthy to be called <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 word"> Body; as in Natural things, the Head cut off is not called a Body, but a Trunk Wherefore <HI>Ari&s;totle</HI> in his Civil Philo&s;o|phy &s;aith, <HI>When&s;oever One is made of Many, among the &s;ame, One &s;hall be the Ruler, and the other &s;hall be the Rule<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI> And this Ruler thus rai&s;ed and ap|pointed in Kingdoms is called a <HI>King</HI> from the Saxon word Koning, intima|ting Power and Knowledge, wherewith every Sovereign ought e&s;pecially to be
<PB N="3" REF="9">Inve&s;ted: And thus of a Multitude of People ari&s;eth a Kingdom, which is a Body My&s;tical. And in this Body <HI>My&s;ti|cal,</HI> or <HI>Political,</HI> the Intent of the People (like Blood in the Natural Body) is the fir&s;t lively thing; that is Politick pro|vi&s;ion for the Utility and Wealth of the &s;ame People, which is imparted to the Head and members of the &s;ame Body, whereby it is Nouri&s;hed and Maintained; and by the Law, which cometh from <HI>Ligando,</HI> of Binding, this My&s;tical Body is knit and pre&s;erv'd to|gether, and the Members and Parts thereof, as the Natural Body by Sinews, do every one retain their proper Fun|ctions: And as the Head of a Natural Body cannot change his Sinews, nor withhold from his Inferiour Members their peculiar Powers of Nouri&s;hments; no more can a King, which is the Head of the Body Politick, change the Laws of that Body, or withdraw from the &s;aid People their proper Sub&s;tance a|gain&s;t their Wills.</P>
<P>And therefore it now follows, that we &s;peak &s;omewhat of the Fundamen|tals of laws in General, and then de|&s;cend to the particular Fundamentals of the Laws of <HI>England;</HI> and afterwards briefly declare the Executive Powers of the &s;ame. And fir&s;t of</P>

<DIV3 TYPE="subsection">
<HEAD>The Law Eternal.</HEAD>
<P><HI>LEx Aeterna</HI> is the Rea&s;on of the Divine Will, whereby God will <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ave all things of him Created, to be moved and directed to a good End; and it is called <HI>The first Law,</HI> and all other Laws are derived from it. And this Law Eternal none may be able to know, as in him&s;elf, but the Ble&s;&s;ed alone: But God of his Goodne&s;s re|vealeth it to all, in as much as is ne|ce&s;&s;ary for them, otherwi&s;e he &s;hould bind his Creatures to impo&s;&s;ible things, which to be in God is mo&s;t wicked to think. And God reveals this Law Eternal, or the Divine Will, to the Ra|tional Creature Three manner of ways, that is, Fir&s;t by the Light of Natural Under&s;tanding, and then it is called <HI>The Law of Rea&s;on:</HI> Secondly, by Di|vine Revelation, and then it is called <HI>The Divine Law:</HI> Thirdly, by Rea&s;on in the Prince, or any other Secondary Pe &s;on Governing, who hath power to Impo&s;e a Law upon this Subjects, and
<PB N="5" REF="10">then it is called <HI>Humane Law,</HI> altho' it be Originally in&s;tituted from God: And becau&s;e what&s;oever the Second Cau&s;e doth, the Fir&s;t doth al&s;o by a more Noble manner; therefore the a|fore&s;aid Three Laws are called in God, <HI>One Law Eternal;</HI> and this is that Law of which it is written, <HI>Prov.</HI> 8. <HI>Per<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">me Reges regnant, Et legum conditores ju&s;ta di&s;cernunt.</HI></P>

<HEAD>The Law of Rea&s;on.</HEAD>
<P><HI>LEx Rationis,</HI> which among&s;t Doctors is al&s;o called <HI>The Law of Nature,</HI> or <HI>Jus Gentium, The Law of Nations,</HI> may be doubly con&s;idered, that is, either as it re&s;pects all Creatures, even Irratio|nals, for all Irrational Creatures, not hindred, do live and &s;ub&s;i&s;t under cer|tain Rules to them &s;et by Nature, they al&s;o con&s;erve their kind and by In&s;tinct of Nature nouri&s;h their Young; and things by Nature contrary to them they fear, and e&s;pecially when alone it re|&s;pects the Rational Humane Creature, created to the Image of God: And it is called <HI>The Law of Nations,</HI> for that it ought to be kept by all Nations, as well among the Jews and Gentiles, as Chri|&s;tians. And thus, <HI>The Law of Rea&s;on</HI> is a participation of <HI>The Law Enternal:</HI>
<PB N="6" REF="11">From whence it is &s;aid in the <HI>P&s;alms, Signatum e&s;t &s;uper nos Lumen vultus tui Domine, &s;cilicet, Lumen Veritatis.</HI></P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="subsection">
<HEAD>Divine Law.</HEAD>
<P><HI>LEx Divina,</HI> is a true Sign reveal'd to the Rational Creature of the Divine Rea&s;on, Willing the Rational Creature, to be held or bound to do &s;omething, or not do it, for obtaining Eternal Felicity, as are the Laws of the Old Te&s;tament, which are called <HI>Morals,</HI> and the <HI>Evangelical Law;</HI> and &s;ome|times it is called, <HI>Law in&s;tituted by Man,</HI> but improperly neverthele&s;s, when the Law is for obtaining Eternal Felicity.</P>
<P>Moreover, be&s;ides <HI>The Law of Rea&s;on</HI> and <HI>Humane Law,</HI> it was nece&s;&s;ary for the Direction of Humane Life, to have the <HI>Divine Law,</HI> for Four Rea&s;ons: Fir&s;t, Whereas Man was created to enjoy Eternal Beatitude, it was nece&s;&s;ary that be&s;ides the <HI>Law of Rea&s;on</HI> and <HI>Humane Law,</HI> he &s;hould be Directed to his End by a Law Divinely in&s;tituted. Secondly, For the incertainty of Humane Judg|ment, that he &s;hould be directed by a Law given by Divine In&s;piration, from which it appeared, that he might by no means deviate. Thirdly, Becau&s;e the Judgment of Man may not be of
<PB N="7" REF="11">Interior Acts; therefore it was nece&s;|&s;ary to have a Law Divine, which &s;hould rectifie the Interiors, as well as the Exteriors of Men, Fourthly, Be|cau&s;e Human Law cannot puni&s;h every evil Act, it was nece&s;&s;ary to have a Divine Law, which &s;hould let no Evil go unpuni&s;hed; and the&s;e four Rea&s;ons are touched in this Ver&s;e,</P>

<DIV3 TYPE="subsection">
<HEAD>Humane Law.</HEAD>
<P><HI>LEx Humana &s;ive Po&s;itiva,</HI> is a Law Deduced by Rea&s;on, from the Law of Rea&s;on, and the Divine Law; and therefore in every Po&s;itive Law well In&s;tituted, there is &s;omewhat of the Law of Rea&s;on, and the Divine Law, And Humane Law is a true &s;ign by Hu|mane Tradition and Authority, imme|diately Con&s;tituted: And that Human Law be Ju&s;t, Two things are required; That is, Prudence and Authority, be|cau&s;e it is called <HI>Lex &agrave; ligando,</HI> but every Sentence of a Prudent Man doth not bind the Community or any of them, if he do not pre&s;ide over them. And in the Law of Men the&s;e Proprieties are required, <HI>viz.</HI> That they be Hone&s;t, Ju&s;t,
<PB N="8" REF="12">Po&s;&s;ible, according to the Cu&s;tom of the Country, and convenient to the place and time; Nece&s;&s;ary, Profitable, Manife&s;t; al&s;o that they be Ordained for no Private end, but for the Com|mon good; and Humane Laws not con|trary to the Divine Law ought to be kept al&s;o in Con&s;cience, <HI>Et qui eas &s;per|nit Deo re&s;i&s;tit.</HI></P>
<P>From what hath been &s;aid it appears, That the Divine Law re&s;pects the Spi|ritual end, The Law of Rea&s;on the Natural end, and that Human Law may direct to both; And the Law of Rea&s;on takes of Nature of the thing for a Foundation, but Human Law, the pub|lick Expedience or Good.</P>
<P>Now of the&s;e Four Laws, all Laws in general con&s;i&s;t and be &s;ounded, if they are good. And that we may &s;hew par|ticularly, and more e&s;pecially from whence ari&s;e,</P>

<HEAD>The Fundamentals of the Law of <HI>England.</HI></HEAD>
<P>WE mu&s;t know that the Law of <HI>England,</HI> or Humane Law in <HI>England,</HI> takes its Fundamentals from Six chief Principles: Fir&s;t, <HI>The Law of Rea&s;on.</HI> Secondly, <HI>Divine Law.</HI> Third|ly, <HI>Divers Cu&s;toms of the Kingdom.</HI> Fourthly, <HI>Divers Principles</HI> called
<PB N="9" REF="12"><HI>Maxims.</HI> Fifthly, <HI>Particular Cu&s;toms in certain places.</HI> Sixthly, <HI>From divers Sta|tutes of the Common Council of the King|dom in Parliament;</HI> of which we &s;hall &s;peak &s;omething in order.</P>
<P>And fir&s;t, <HI>The Law of Rea&s;on</HI> is held in this as in all other Kingdoms; and the Learned in the Laws of <HI>England</HI> make two Degrees of the Law of Rea|&s;on, <HI>(&s;cilicet) Lex. Rationis Primariae, &amp; Lex Rationis &s;ecundariae: Ex Primaria,</HI> From the fir&s;t are forbidden Murder, Man&s;laughter, Oppre&s;&s;ion of the Inno|cent, Perjuries, Deceits and many &s;uch like. But the manner of puni&s;hing the&s;e &s;orts of Offences, is according to di|vers Principles and Maxims or Statutes, to this end e&s;pecially ordained; and it is called the Law of Rea&s;on primary; For that tho&s;e things which are Com|manded or Forbidden by that Law, are grounded upon Rea&s;on al&s;o, with|out any other Law joyned or oppo&s;ed to it: The Law of Rea&s;on &s;ecundary is likewi&s;e divided in two parts, That is, General and Particular; The Law of Rea&s;on &s;ecundary General, is de|rived from that Law of Propriety Ge|neral, which is held throughout the World; From this are prohibited Thefts, Di&s;&s;ei&s;ins, and many other, And it is called the Law of Rea&s;on
<PB N="10" REF="13">Secundary, for that it is founded not upon Rea&s;on alone, but from the Law of Propriety, and the Rea&s;on derived from that Law; for becau&s;e the Law of property &s;aith, <HI>Such a thing is the pro|per Goods of &s;uch a Man;</HI> Therefore &s;aith Rea&s;on, grounded upon that Law, <HI>that thing is not to be taken from him un|ju&s;tly again&s;t his Will.</HI> And the Law of Rea&s;on Secundary Particular, is that which is Founded upon divers Gene|ral and Particular Cu&s;toms, and divers Maxims and Statutes, only had and or|dained in the Kingdom of <HI>England:</HI> As if a Di&s;tre&s;s dye, it &s;hall not be imputed to him who di&s;trained; but to him who hath the Propriety, becau&s;e the Defect is to be a&s;&s;igned in him, for that he did not pay the Rent: And Rea&s;on is founded upon the Cu|&s;tom afore&s;aid, &s;o that there need not be any Written Law had thereof. And we find &s;o many Secundary Rea&s;ons in the Laws of <HI>England,</HI> that many are willing to affirms the whole Law of <HI>England,</HI> to be proved by Rea&s;on, which notwith&s;tanding is by no means to be affirmed, as by another Example.</P>
<P>By a certain Statute it is Ordained, That he who hath abjur'd the Realm, whil&s;t he is in the publick High-way, &s;hall be in peace with our Lord the
<PB N="11" REF="13">King and not in any &s;ort mole&s;ted; and by the Cu&s;tom of the Kingdom, he is to be conducted from Town to Town, by the Con&s;tables, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> to the Sea-port, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Now if he E&s;cape, the Con&s;table ought not to be charged to the King, becau&s;e by rea&s;on of the Statute, he could not keep him in &s;afe Cu&s;tody, or u&s;e any Force or Impri|&s;onment whereby he might be kept in &s;afe Cu&s;tody; and the Rea&s;on is ground|ed upon that Statute. And &s;ome &s;ay, Rob|bery is to be prohibited from Rea&s;on Primary, even before the Law of Pro|perty, for that it was not Lawful even when all things were in Common, to take any thing from another by force, or to throw him out of his Habitati|on; but that &s;uch Robbery is to be puni&s;hed with Death, is from the Cu|&s;tom of the Law of <HI>England.</HI> Al&s;o from the General Law of Property afore&s;aid, by the Laws of <HI>England</HI> are excepted Birds, Wild bea&s;ts and Bea&s;ts of Warren, in which by the Laws of <HI>England</HI> is no Property to any One, unle&s;s they be Tame; yet ne|verthele&s;s by the Laws of <HI>England</HI> in the Eggs of <HI>Herons,</HI> and &s;uch like, Build|ing in the Woods of any, is a Proper|ty. And for that every Deduction of Rea&s;on in the Laws of <HI>England,</HI> pro|ceeds
<PB N="12" REF="14">from the fir&s;t Principles, or from &s;omewhat from tho&s;e Principles deri|ved, no Man alth&ocirc; the mo&s;t Wi&s;e, can Judge ju&s;tly or Argue rightly in the Laws of <HI>England,</HI> if he know not the&s;e Principles.</P>
<P>The Second Fundamental of the Law of <HI>England</HI> is <HI>Lex Divina,</HI> whereby to puni&s;h the Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors again&s;t the <HI>Divine Law.</HI> The Law of <HI>England</HI> in many Courts of our Lord the King doth Inquire of Hereticks: Al&s;o if any Statute be made or &s;et forth again&s;t them; as that none &s;hall give Alms, it ought to be of no force; al&s;o, Per|&s;ons Excommunicated in the Laws of <HI>England</HI> may not Pro&s;ecute, nor have Communication with others whil&s;t the Excommunication is certified. And from the &s;ame Fundamental the Law of <HI>England</HI> admits the Spiritual Juri&s;|diction of Tithes, and other things which do of right belong to the Ec|cle&s;ia&s;tical Juri&s;diction, and receives Ca|nonical or Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Laws, <HI>Quae non Excedunt pote&s;tatem ferentis:</HI> &s;o that in many Ca&s;es it behoves the Kings Ju|&s;tices to Judge according to the Laws of the Church; As if the Law of the Church be, that the Sentence of Di|vorce is not in force till it is affirmed upon Appeal, The Judges of our Lord
<PB N="13" REF="14">the King, &s;hall form their Judgment according to the Laws of the Church; And if <HI>A. B.</HI> and <HI>C. D.</HI> have Goods and Chattels joyntly, and <HI>A. B.</HI> by his la&s;t Will, give his part to <HI>E. F.</HI> the Eccle&s;i|a&s;tical Judges are bound in this ca&s;e to adjudge this Will void.</P>
<P>The Third Fundamental of the Law of <HI>England,</HI> is the General Cu&s;toms of the Kingdom, which are divers Ge|neral Cu&s;toms u&s;ed and approved of in Ancient time, throughout the whole Kingdom of <HI>England,</HI> and who at|tempts any thing again&s;t them Works again&s;t Law and Ju&s;tice; And the&s;e are properly called the Common Law, and ought always to be determined by the Judges, whether a General Cu&s;tom or not, and not by the Country; and of the&s;e and other Principles or <HI>Maxims,</HI> a great part of the Law of <HI>England</HI> de|pends; and therefore the King by his Coronation Oath promi&s;eth <HI>(inter alia)</HI> that he will faithfully ob&s;erve all the Cu&s;toms of the Kingdom; and the An|cient Cu&s;toms of the Kingdom, is the Original and Foundation of divers Courts in the &s;ame Kingdom; Where|of one is <HI>The Chancery</HI> of the King|dom, in which <HI>(inter alia)</HI> Writs origi|nal are obtained, directed to other Courts of the King; another <HI>The Kings-Bench,</HI>
<PB N="14" REF="15">in which are handled all Trea|&s;ons, Murders, Homicides, Felonies, and other things done again&s;t the Kings Peace; another Court is called <HI>The Common Bench,</HI> in which Common Pleas are handled; (That is to &s;ay,) of Lands and Tenements, Debts and Chattels and &s;uch like; another Court is called <HI>The Kings Exchequer,</HI> in which are handled divers matters touching the King alone, as of Sheriffs, E&s;cheats or Receivers, Bayliffs and other the Kings Officers and the like; and the&s;e are called Courts of Record, becau&s;e tho&s;e who pre&s;ide as Judges ought to be a&s;&s;igned by the Kings Letters Patent; and the&s;e Courts have many and di|vers other Authorities, of which we &s;hall &s;peak more hereafter in their proper places, and likewi&s;e of divers other Courts of inferiour Authority in the Kingdom of <HI>England:</HI> And alth&ocirc; in divers Statutes and Books, mention is made of the Authority of the&s;e Courts; yet we have no written Law of their In&s;titution; for their In&s;titu|tion depends upon the Cu&s;tom of the Kingdom, which hath &s;o great Autho|rity, that they may not be altered, or their Names changed or altered, but by Act of Parliament. Al&s;o there is an Ancient Cu&s;tom, which is confir|med
<PB N="15" REF="15">by the Statute of <HI>Marlebridge;</HI> That all &s;hall do and receive Ju&s;tice in the Kings Court, and another, that none &s;hall be put to An&s;wer, or be judged, but according to the Law of the Land; and this is confirmed by <HI>Magna Charta:</HI> And there are other General Cu&s;toms in the Kingdom of <HI>England,</HI> which retain the force of Law, as that the elde&s;t Son &s;hall &s;ucceed the Father in the Inheritance, and many more, not here to be recited.</P>
<P>From whence it appears, that Cu|&s;toms in the Laws of <HI>England</HI> may not be proved by Rea&s;on alone, for how can it be proved by Rea&s;on, that the Husband &s;hall have the Wife's Land for Term of his Life, as Tenant by that Law, and that the Wife &s;hall have only the Third part, <HI>&s;cilicet,</HI> that it &s;hall be &s;o done and not otherwi&s;e? And it is certain, that the Law of Property is not the Law of Rea&s;on, but a Cu&s;to|mary Law, and ought to be accoun|ted among&s;t the General Cu&s;toms of the Kingdom, and there is not any Statute or written Law of the In&s;titu|tions of the Cu&s;toms of the Law of <HI>England,</HI> but according to the Skilful in the Law of <HI>England:</HI> The Ancient Cu&s;toms of the Law of <HI>England</HI> are of them&s;elves of &s;ufficient Authority;
<PB N="16" REF="16">and the Cu&s;tomary Law is the mo&s;t firm Law, provided &s;uch a Cu&s;tom be not again&s;t the Law of God, or the Law of Rea&s;on.</P>
<P>The Fourth Fundamental of the Law of <HI>England</HI> con&s;i&s;ts of <HI>Divers Principles,</HI> which the Learned in the Law call <HI>Maxims,</HI> always e&s;teemed and held for Law of this Kingdom of <HI>England,</HI> which none Learned in the Law may contradict, becau&s;e every one of them gives Faith or Credit to it &s;elf; and whether a Maxim or not is to be tried by the Judges, as before is &s;aid of General Cu&s;toms of the Kingdom, and not by the Country: And the&s;e <HI>Maxims</HI> are not alone taken for Law, but al&s;o all other like ca&s;es, and all things nece&s;&s;arily following upon them, are to be placed in like Law, and they are in the &s;ame force and &s;trength in Law as Statutes; and alth&ocirc; all the&s;e <HI>Maxims</HI> might conveni|ently be numbred among&s;t the afore|&s;aid General Cu&s;toms, &s;ince Ancient Cu&s;tom is the &s;ole Authority, as well of the&s;e as tho&s;e; yet becau&s;e tho&s;e Ge|neral Cu&s;toms are diffu&s;ed and known, they may ea&s;ily and without &s;tudy in the Laws be known, but the&s;e Max|ims are only known in the Kings Courts, or by tho&s;e who are Learned
<PB N="17" REF="16">in the Law; and now for example &s;ake we will mention a few of them, &s;ince to declare them fully great Vo|lumes would not &s;uffice: And fir&s;t, there is a certain Maxim in the Laws of <HI>England,</HI> that no Pre&s;cription in Lands maketh a Right; al&s;o, that Pre&s;cripti|on in Rents and Profits to be taken in the Lands of another maketh a Right; al&s;o, that the limitation of Pre|&s;cription is generally taken <HI>&agrave; tempore cujus centrarij Memoria hominum non ex|i&s;tit, &amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>And further, there are many other Maxims, as in certain Actions, The Proce&s;s is by Summons, Attachment and Di&s;tre&s;s Infinite; and in &s;ome by <HI>Capias</HI> Infinite, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and that there &s;hould be the&s;e divers Proce&s;&s;es in di|vers Actions, may &s;eem expedient and rea&s;onable; but that there &s;hould be the&s;e divers Proce&s;&s;es had in the Law of <HI>England,</HI> and none other, cannot be proved by Rea&s;on; therefore they mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily have their force from the Maxims afore&s;aid, or the Ancient Cu|&s;tom of the Kingdom: And &s;ome Maxims &s;eem to be founded upon Rea&s;on Secundary; and therefore &s;ome may think they may be put unto the fir&s;t Fundamental of other Laws of <HI>England;</HI> as if any command a Tre&s;|pa&s;s, he is a Tre&s;pa&s;&s;or, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>

<P>From the&s;e things before contain'd it may be deduced, which often fall out, That in one and the &s;ame ca&s;e two or three Fundamentals of Law ought to concur together before the Plaintiff may obtain his Right, as by Example may appear: As if any afte<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter"> Entry by him made into any Land with a &s;trong hand, make a Feoffmen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter"> for Maintenance, to defraud the Po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;or of his Action; then the Deman|dant by the Statute of 8 <HI>Hen.</HI> 6. <HI>cap.</HI> 9. &s;hall recover his treble Damages, ac|cording to what Damages &s;hall be a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the Jury: In which ca&s;e it appeareth that &s;uch Entry is prohibited by the Law of Rea&s;on Secundary; but that the Demandant &s;hall Recover, his treble Damages, is by the afore&s;aid Statute: And that the Damages &s;hall be A&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the Jury, is by the Cu&s;tom of the Kingdom: And thus Three Fundamentals of Law concur in this ca&s;e.</P>
<PB N="21" REF="18">
<P>And it is to be noted, that there are many Cu&s;toms, as well General as Par|ticular, and al&s;o Divers Laws, called <HI>Maxims,</HI> which take not their force from &s;trong Rea&s;on, but from the Cu|&s;tom of the Kingdom: For by <HI>Statutes</HI> they may be changed into the contra|ry, and what can be changed, can ne|ver be affirmed to be the Law of Rea&s;on Primary: As for Example; How doth it &s;tand with Rea&s;on or Con&s;cience, That if one Bound in an Obligation to pay Money, pay part of the Money, but takes no Acquittance, or lo&s;e it; by the Laws of <HI>England</HI> he &s;hall be com|pell'd to pay that Money again, becau&s;e of the General Maxim, That in an Acti|on of Debt upon Bond, the Defendant may not plead <HI>Nihil debet,</HI> or <HI>Quod poe|cuniam &s;olvit,</HI> nor otherwi&s;e di&s;charge him&s;elf unle&s;s by Acquittance, or other &s;ufficient Writing amounting to a Di&s;|charge in Law; and this to avoid the great Inconvenience which would fol|low, if every one by word alone might avoid an Obligation.</P>

In the &s;econd place, Con&s;cience import|eth more properly Knowledg with another thing, &s;till with &s;ome particu|lar Act; and thus Con&s;cience properly &s;peaking, is no other thing than the applying of a certain Knowledg to &s;ome particular Act, from whence it may be deduced, that from the mo&s;t perfect knowledg of &s;ome Law or Science, and the right application of that knowledg to &s;ome particular Act, followeth the mo&s;t pure, perfect and be&s;t Con&s;cience; and if there be a defect in knowledg of the truth of that Law, or in the application of the &s;ame to &s;ome Act, there followeth thereof an Error, or defect of Con&s;ci|ence.

<P>But that we may more clearly de|clare what Equity is, It is to be known, that becau&s;e it is impo&s;&s;ible to in&s;titute any General Rule of Law, which will in no ca&s;e be defective, therefore <HI>Legi|&s;lators</HI> attend to that which happeneth in many things, and not to particu|lar ca&s;es, nor indeed can they, &s;ince to ob&s;erve the Sentence of Law in &s;ome Ca&s;es, is both again&s;t the Equality of Ju&s;tice and Common Good; &s;o that in &s;ome Ca&s;es it is good, yea ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary (praetermitting the words of the Law) to follow that which rea&s;on of Ju&s;tice requireth. And to this end Equity is ordained, which is al&s;o cal|led <HI>Epicaya, &s;cilicet,</HI> to moderate the Rigour of the Law, and it taketh not away the very Right, but that which &s;eemeth to be Right, by general deter|mination of Law. And ca&s;es may happen in which the Law of God, and the Law of Rea&s;on, would be vi|olated by the ob&s;ervance of them; as in the Law of <HI>England</HI> there is a gene|ral Prohibition, that it &s;hall not be law|ful for any Man to enter into the Ground of another without Authority of the Owner, or of the Law; yet it is excepted, That if Bea&s;ts by the High|way e&s;cape into another Man's Corn, he that driveth them may ju&s;tifie the

<P>Re&s;olved, That if the Plea be holden by Writ or without Writ, the Suitors are Judges.

And in ca&s;e they hold Plea by force of the King's Writ, it doth not change the Nature and Juri&s;|diction of the Court. For as the&s;e without Writs are not Courts of Re|cord, &s;o when the Plea is holden by Writ, the Courts are of the &s;ame Nature. For upon a Judgment given in both Ca&s;es, a VVrit of fal&s;e Judgment lieth, and not a Writ of Error. But it is true the King may create a new Court, and appoint new Judges in it; but after the Court is e&s;tabli&s;hed and created, the Judges of the Court ought to determine Matters in the Court.
