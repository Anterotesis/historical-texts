<P><HI>_JAnuary</HI> the fir&s;t 1649. We embarqued from <HI>Wexford</HI> in the <HI>Hector</HI> for <HI>Corke,</HI> &s;ayled two or three leagues beyond <HI>Greenor-bay,</HI> but were driven back, the wind turning upon us: upon the Saturday following the wind being fair we got within &s;ight of <HI>Dungarvan,</HI> that night proved very windy, and about four in the morning, on the Lords day, a very tempe&s;tu|ous wind aro&s;e, and the &s;torm was the great|e&s;t that ever any of the Sea-men knew (as they &s;aid) the wind was at South-ea&s;t very thick, we hoped to fetch <HI>Corke,</HI> being within a mile of the &s;hore, but could not po&s;&s;ibly make land: in that di&s;tre&s;s we put to &s;ea, hoping by that way to &s;ave life, the wind continued all that Sabbath day at South-ea&s;t, South-ea&s;t and by South, and &s;outh &s;outh-ea&s;t, which if the wind had held at &s;outh ea&s;t as it was in the morning, we could not have doubled the point about the land, but had been ca&s;t upon the rocks: we bore two cour&s;es to keep off from the &s;hore all the day, and being as we &s;uppo&s;ed about the pitch of the Cape Cleere, at nine on Sabbath day night we &s;hipt a great Sea which &s;plit and carryed away our fore&s;aile, and &s;o were forced to bring to a fore-top &s;ail to keep from the &s;hore, and &s;o bore that fore-tope-&s;aile till two in the night, in which time we were forced to cut our Anchor from the bough to &s;ave the &s;hip from foundring, we having at that time five foot water in the hold. The Monday morning we were ten leagues to leeward of the Cape Cleere, and the
<PB N="4" REF="3">wind was up at South-we&s;t, then we made all the &s;ayl po&s;&s;ible to fetch &s;ome harbour, and it plea&s;ed God, we made the Cape, hoping to fetch <HI>Baltamore,</HI> but the wind coming up at South-ea&s;t and by ea&s;t, we were forced to Sea again all the night, the wind continuing at &s;outh-ea&s;t, &s;outh-ea&s;t and by &s;outh, and &s;outh-&s;outh-ea&s;t.</P>
<P>Tue&s;day we made the Mi&s;ne head and could fetch no harbour the wind being &s;till at &s;outh-ea&s;t. Wedne&s;day the wind came up at we&s;t, and we made for &s;hore again, and came up as high as <HI>Gally-head</HI> hoping to fetch <HI>Kin&s;ale;</HI> about three in the after-noone the wind came up at ea&s;t &s;outh-ea&s;t, and then we hoped to recover <HI>Ca&s;tlehaven</HI> before night, and made for it, and in our running in, the wind veared at &s;outh-ea&s;t and blew very fre&s;h, and we &s;till hoping to gain the harbour, ran in, knowing no other way to &s;ave life, the wind being &s;o contrary, it grew extraordinary thick, rained and blew much, we fired three or four pieces of ordnance (for lights) and &s;aw one light from the Ca&s;tle, as we &s;uppo&s;ed, and two other lights to the Ea&s;t|ward, which put us to an amazement, not knowing whether they were friends or enemies, and could not po&s;&s;ibly &s;ee the going into the Harbor, but were in the very breach of the &s;hore, the &s;ight where|of cau&s;ed a great &s;crick in the &s;hip, and thereupon brought our &s;hip to, hoping thereby to have come to an Anchor, which if we had done, we had been pa&s;t all hopes of life, the rock being &s;o neer would have cut our Anchor, but God being mo&s;t merciful in that nick of time, the &s;eamen de&s;pairing of life, the wind at an in&s;tant came up at Ea&s;t, which carried us into the &s;ea, and yet &s;o great was the danger, that if the wind did not turn again to the We&s;t in le&s;s then half an hour, we were dead men, by rea&s;on of the rocks called the <HI>Staggs,</HI> &s;o we came in a little time within &s;ight of the rocks, the wind driving us &s;trongly upon them, and then &s;eeing the rocks within a &s;hips length of us, we put our &s;hip to &s;tay, which &s;he would not the &s;ea being &s;o extremely grown, the Sea-men being at their wits end, wi&s;hing us to prepare for death: the Lord again at that very in&s;tant cau&s;ed the wind to come up at South-we&s;t, which carryed us out into the Sea cleer from the rocks where we had the wind favorable that night, and ble&s;&s;ed be God on Thur&s;day we came into <HI>Kin&s;ale,</HI> it being the fir&s;t Harbor that the Lord was plea&s;ed to give us, but that which is mo&s;t admirable is this, that &s;o &s;oon as the &s;hip was come into <HI>Kin&s;ale</HI> Har|bor, &s;he leaked &s;o very much, that the Sea-men came the next morn|ing and told us, that they were almo&s;t drowned that night, and could
<PB N="5" REF="3">&s;carce keep the &s;hip alive in the Harbor, and were forced the next tide to bring her to the Key, and at the Ebbe to repair her, and had much ado to keep her from &s;inking. This being the method of Gods dealing with us in our pa&s;&s;age,</P>
<P>Now concerning the work of God upon my &s;pirit during the &s;torm, thus it was. Towards the evening of the Sabbath day <HI>January</HI> the 5. my heart was exceeding &s;ad and &s;orrowfull even unto death, a nark night approaching, and the &s;hip taking in much water, my &s;pirit fainted and my heart &s;unk within me, the &s;orrows of death caught hold of me, much grieved I was for my poor dear heart who did not expre&s;s half &s;o much fear as my &s;elf, many &s;weet expre&s;&s;ions &s;he u&s;ed in prayers, wi&s;hing me to call earne&s;tly upon God: many words I could not u&s;e, but my heart was praying; it almo&s;t broke my heart to think what my wives friends would &s;ay in <HI>England,</HI> that I &s;hould bring her into <HI>Ireland</HI> to drown her (though I ble&s;s God &s;he never repined at it) troubled I was likewi&s;e for my poor &s;ervants that came in love along with us; it almo&s;t &s;plit my heart to think what the Malignants would &s;ay in <HI>England</HI> when they hear that we were drowned (how they would abu&s;e that pa&s;&s;age of <HI>Paul, Acts</HI> 28.4.) That though vengeance hath not overtaken me at Land, yet I was met withall at Sea; much troubled I was at the manner of the death, &s;uch extraordinary violent deaths importing the na|ture of &s;ome heavy Judgement, as if the Lord had been di&s;plea&s;ed with us, and had not &s;ent us, and <HI>Jonahs</HI> &s;torm was much in my thoughts (I having &s;poken &s;ome words of Exhortation to the com|pany out of that Scripture before the &s;torm began) for God &s;ent that great &s;torm, <HI>Jon.</HI> 1.4. becau&s;e <HI>Jonah</HI> went contrary to his Commands, where I ob&s;erved, That when a Chri&s;tian is in Gods way, upon Gods errand &s;ent to Sea, u&s;ually God makes the Winde and the Seas fa|vourable to him; upon &s;uch con&s;iderations, and many objections made by fle&s;h &amp; blood, I had very much trouble with my unbelieving heart, &amp; could not bring my mind to be willing to die, earne&s;t I had been in &s;ecret prayer at the Throne of Grace before, for 16. or 18. hours to|gether, pleading with the Lord, that if it were po&s;&s;ible this cup of his indignation might pa&s;s over us, that in Judgments he would remem|ber Mercy, however that we might cheerfully &s;ubmit to his &s;weet plea&s;ure; the materials of my long &s;ugge&s;ted prayers were meditations and applications of &s;everall Scriptures which mention Gods power,
<PB N="6" REF="4">wi&s;dome and love in the Seas. God having put it into my minde not long before to note mo&s;t of the chief places in Scripture con|cerning the Seas, as proper and u&s;efull for a Sea-voyage. I pre&s;t my deere Chri&s;t not to drown us, for &s;aid I, we fight for thy King|ly office, throw the <HI>Aegyptians</HI> and all thy implacable enemies into the mid&s;t of the Sea, but let us be pre&s;erved that we may pray&s;e thy Name, <HI>Exod.</HI> 14.27, 30. <HI>&amp;</HI> 15.1. Lord this is a calamity too heavy for thy poor creatures to bear. <HI>Iob</HI> 6.3. were it not that thou ha&s;t ca&s;t our &s;innes into the depths of the Seas: <HI>Micha</HI> 7.19. Lord &s;uffer not the deeps to &s;wallow us up: <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 69.15. Let not all thy waves and billowes pa&s;&s;e over us We have &s;een thy wonders in the deep: <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 107.23. And if thou &s;ave us we &s;hall declare them to the children of men; but if thou make our graves in the Sea, the dead cannot prai&s;e thee: <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 115.17. thou Lord which leade&s;t thy &s;ervants through the deep, prepare dry Land for us: Lord, why &s;hould not the Seas be as favorable to thy &s;ervants as the dry land? Thou laye&s;t up the depth in &s;torehou&s;es. <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 33.7. Thou Lord can&s;t &s;till the noy&s;e of the waves <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 65.7. <HI>P&s;.</HI> 68.22. was a comfortable place to me, that the Lord promi&s;ed to bring againe his people from the depth of the Sea. Sweet Chri&s;t do thy office and be a Saviour to thy people both for &s;oules and bodies, thou laye&s;t the beams of thy Chambers in the waters 10.4. <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 3. and rule&s;t the raging of the Seas. <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 89.9. Now Lord the floods have lifted up their voyce and their waves: <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 93.2. but thou art mightier then the mighty waves of the Sea, The fi&s;hes of the Sea &s;hall &s;hrink at thy pre&s;ence: but why art thou &s;o angry with thy &s;ervants who are &s;ent in thy &s;ervice? Lord ca&s;t the great Dragon into the bottomle&s;&s;e pit, that old Ser|pent called the Devill and Sathan. <HI>Revel.</HI> 12.9. but let thy people live to pray&s;e thee; thou Lord can&s;t &s;ay to the Sea, Be dry: <HI>E&s;a.</HI> 44.27. <HI>E&s;a.</HI> 50.2. and can&s;t ea&s;ily bring us &s;afe to land Lord, ha&s;t not thou made the depths of the Sea a way for thy ran&s;omed ones to pa&s;s over? <HI>E&s;a.</HI> 51.10. Why mu&s;t then thy &s;ervants be drowned as if they were in this malefactors? <HI>Ionah</HI> ran away from thee and would not obey thee, being unwilling to be the mouth and proclaimer of thy Iu&s;tice upon <HI>Nineveh</HI> the head of the <HI>A&s;&s;yrian</HI> Empire: and thou &s;ente&s;t out a great winde, and there was a mighty tempe&s;t in the Sea, <HI>Ionah.</HI> 4. which was no ordinary wind, but &s;ent as a puni&s;hment for his di&s;obedince, yet becau&s;e he was thy &s;ervant, and was not &s;elvi&s;h,
<PB N="7" REF="4">nor di&s;plea&s;ed in thy &s;hewing mercy for feare of his being thought a fal&s;e prophet, but out of zeale for thy glory which he thought was wronged and ob&s;cured by that change, and out of his ardent affecti|ton to thy people that their enemies &s;hould live; and though he &s;aid, he did well to be angry, even unto death, they being not words of expre&s;&s;e rebellion, but of a pa&s;&s;ionate &s;pirit blinded with anger, therefore when he prayed unto thee out of the belly of Hell, he was mightily pre&s;erved. Now Lord, thou which wa&s;t a God &s;o gracious and merciful &s;low to anger, &amp; of great kindne&s;s towards the Heathens in <HI>Nineveh</HI> &s;hall not we find thy mercy? if thou ha&s;t any further work for us to do in our generation, we &s;hall. Lord, it is the wicked that is like the troubled Sea, who&s;e water ca&s;ts up mire and dirt <HI>I&s;a.</HI> 57.20. Thy Ju&s;tice was very wonderfull and glorious at <HI>Wexford,</HI> in drown|ing tho&s;e Pirates and wicked men in the Sea, that had done &s;o much mi&s;chief to thy people in that Element, and what will thy enemies &s;ay when the carka&s;&s;es of thy people are given to be food for the Fi&s;hes? Lord command this great wind into thy trea&s;ure, and bring forth windes &s;erviceable for us that we may have an au&s;picious gale, and an expeditious &s;aile into &s;ome Harbor where it &s;hall plea&s;e thy Maje&s;ty, for thy poor creatures are at their wits end, and death appears in their faces; thou only can&s;t &s;hut up the Sea with doors, <HI>Iob</HI> 38.8. Thou make&s;t the deep to boyle like a pot, and make&s;t the Sea like a pot of oyntment, as if the Sea was hoary by the long white frothy path, <HI>Job.</HI> 41.31, 32. Sweet Chri&s;t, thou ha&s;t dominion from &s;ea to &s;ea, <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 72.8. and thou ha&s;t given to the &s;ea a decree, that the waters pa&s;&s;e not thy commands, <HI>Prov.</HI> 8.29. Therefore though the &s;ea roare and threaten to &s;wallow us up, yet unle&s;s thou give&s;t it a commi&s;&s;ion to devour us it cannot hurt us: &s;weet Chri&s;t, the &s;ea is unto thee as the dry land, the winds and &s;eas will obey thee, deere Redeemer wilt not thou &s;peak one word to &s;ave the lives of thy own members? <HI>Matth.</HI> 8.26, 27. <HI>&amp;</HI> 14.27. <HI>Mark.</HI> 4.29. Peace, Be &s;till, will make a great calme. Lord a&s;&s;ure &s;ome of thy poor &s;ervants that all &s;hall be well, as thou did&s;t to ble&s;&s;ed <HI>Paul Acts</HI> 27.23. Give &s;ome vi&s;ion and manife&s;tation of thy love, for it was for thy &s;ake that we committed our &s;elves to the &s;ea, let &s;ome of thy &s;ervants in the &s;hip be a&s;&s;ured from heaven that we &s;hall be &s;afe, however Lord let thy will be our wils: with other Scriptures, not now perfectly remembred. Now after long prayers and medita|tions,
<PB N="8" REF="5">it plea&s;ed God about &s;ix on the Sabboth day night that the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t began to quiet my &s;pirit in him&s;elf, and I was well per&s;waded to die, and began to be ravi&s;ht with the Con&s;ideration of the joyes of Heaven, how quickly I and my poor heart &s;hould be in our Ma&s;ters joyes, that expre&s;&s;ion of entring into my Ma&s;ters joy af|fected me much, that the joy was too big to enter into me, I mu&s;t be &s;wallowed up in it, and that my Ma&s;ters joy could be no &s;mall joy; thereupon I &s;pake comfortably to my wife, de&s;iring her to cheer up, for that we &s;hould &s;uddenly be in Heaven, if the Lord was plea&s;ed thus to take us to him&s;elf, who re&s;igned her &s;oul to God, and we took our leaves &s;olemnly of each other, with our eyes full of teares, which I felt running down her cheeks when I ki&s;t them, &s;aying that all teares &s;hall &s;uddenly be wiped from our eyes in Heaven, and with a great fervour of &s;pirit I thought &s;everall times to this purpo&s;e, Sweet Je&s;us I come to thee, we come not only in this Sea of waters, but Lord we come to thee in a Sea of blood if it &s;hall plea&s;e thee to call us; the &s;torm &s;till increa&s;ed, and I grew exceeding heavy and &s;leepy, but rou&s;ed my &s;elf up, and checked my heart, that I &s;hould <HI>Jonah</HI> like offer to &s;leep in &s;uch a &s;torm: what, be drowned in my &s;leep! my wife often begged at me not to &s;leep, but I could not po&s;&s;ibly for|bear &s;leep, if it had been to have &s;aved all our lives; &s;o it plea&s;ed God, that &s;itting as upright as I could, I fell into as fa&s;t a &s;leep as ever I was in all my life.</P>

<HEAD>And in my &s;leep I dreamed.</HEAD>
<P>_THat I was in an upper chamber with my &s;weet Redeemer Chri&s;t Je&s;us, and that there were many Suiters attended to &s;peake with him; to be&s;eech him to &s;ave their Ships and Barks that they might not peri&s;h by the &s;torme, I thought it was a large roome, wherein there was a long table with an ordinary Car|pet, and two candles &s;tanding upon it, two trenchers of Tobacco, and Pipes, and one Man walking up and downe by the toble&punc; of a middle &s;taturs, about thirty years of age, the hairs of his Head long and white as flax; but curling at the Ends, but the haire of his upper lipp browne, in &s;ad coulor'd cloathes, and a cloth broad brim'd hatt, I asked him who he was, who &s;aid he waited upon Je&s;us Chri&s;t; I asked him where Je&s;us Chri&s;t was, he pointed to a Curtin, &s;aying, there he is; I beheld and &s;aw a glorious &s;hi|ning but no per&s;on, and methought Je&s;us Chri&s;t &s;pake to me, and asked me what I would have, I &s;aid the lives of all in the Ship, &s;aid he in what &s;hip &s;aid I in the <HI>Hector,</HI> it is a bad name &s;aid he, for &s;uch as profe&s;&s;e me. <HI>Ca&s;tor</HI> and <HI>Pollux</HI> is for <HI>Heathens,</HI> I prayed him that we might not dye in this manner, &s;ayes he to me are not you &s;afe? but good Lord &s;aid I, I mu&s;t returne, and I beg life for all in the &s;hip, who are they &s;aid he? I an&s;wered that there was my deare Wife and three Servants. Lieutenant Colo|nell <HI>Saunders,</HI> Major <HI>Bee,</HI> Mr. <HI>Hewes,</HI> hone&s;t <HI>Abraham,</HI> and other pa&s;&s;ingers thy Servants, (&s;aid Ie&s;us Chri&s;t at my naming Lieu.

Then me thought Je&s;us Chri&s;t askt me why I was not willing to dye? I told him that by this death I could not glorifie him, thinking upon that Scripture, <HI>Iohn</HI> 21.19. and me thought I was &s;omething impatient that the Lord &s;hould &s;urprize us, get|ting us into a &s;hip at his call for his Service, and then to drowne us, as if we were Parricides or hainous Malefactors, which by
<PB N="10" REF="6">Law were drowned: at that me thought Je&s;us Chri&s;t withdrew, as if he was di&s;plea&s;ed, &s;aid I, Lord, if thou drowne&s;t tho&s;e that love thee, what wilt thou doe to thine Enemies? but could get no an&s;wer, whereupon I was &s;en&s;ible of my impatience, and thought that I fell downe flat downe on the ground, and cryed for Mer|cy, &s;aying Lord, we ki&s;&s;e thy Rod, and turne our naked backs, &s;trike as much as thou plea&s;e&s;t. Lord, I plead nothing but thy free grace; it may be many of us have offended in exce&s;&s;ive drinking, and now thou art puni&s;hing us in our owne Element, however our &s;innes are more then the &s;ands of the Sea-&s;hore but let pi|ty move thee to &s;ave us; thou &s;weet Redeemer which ha&s;t been at Sea in &s;tormes, that art a mercifull high Prie&s;t, like unto us in all things but &s;inne. <HI>Heb.</HI> 2.17. and 4.15. take pity upon thine owne fle&s;h and blood; what Father but would &s;ave his Child from drewning if he could ha&s;t thou no worke for any of us to doe? I thought the an&s;wer was, but little to be done by &s;ome of us; (my Wife tells me that but a little before I &s;lept, I &s;aid, cer|tainly God had &s;omething for me, and others to doe for his &s;er|vice, and therefore we &s;hould not dye at this time, which I did not remember;) &s;weet Chri&s;t hear us as thou dide&s;t thy Di&s;ciples &s;ave us quickly or el&s;e we peri&s;h, and being earne&s;t in prayer, in my dreame me thought that the man in the roome came to me, and told me that this was no naturall &s;torme of Gods &s;ending, but an extraordinary Tempe&s;t rai&s;ed by Satan (by Gods permi&s;&s;ion) to de&s;troy tho&s;e which were coming to fight again&s;t his Servants, and bad me u&s;e that argument to his Ma&s;ter.

I further dream'd that the Devill and his Imps were very earne&s;t with Je&s;us Chri&s;t to get leave to de|&s;troy the Governour of Wexford, by the &s;torme; but the Lord &s;aid, it &s;hould not be; &s;ome there were that had Barkes at Wez|ford, that attended to &s;peake with Je&s;us Chri&s;t, I could not tell what they &s;aid, they di&s;cour&s;ed much about the Governour, and all that I heard Chri&s;t &s;ay, was that winter was not yet come for them at Wexford, then I thought I met with Captaine <HI>Ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">re|bottell,</HI> who had very great re&s;pect &s;howne to him, and I thought his prayers did us very much good, and he was very much com|mended for his tenderne&s;&s;e to the &s;ick Souldiers at Wexford, I thought there were other men from Wexford that came for &s;afe pa&s;&s;ages, and one Officer was very earne&s;t for a Ship that he was to come in, and I heard this expre&s;&s;ion concerning him, we mu&s;t take &s;peciall care of his Ship; for he was very tender and kinde to the poore &s;ick Souldiers, and much di&s;cour&s;e I heard about &s;ick Souldiers. Je&s;us Chri&s;t &s;aid, if &s;tormes will not doe, I have o|ther afflictions to make them more tender-hearted and pitifull, me thought the per&s;on that &s;o walked in the roome, &s;pake much to this effect, that there would be many &s;tormes by rea&s;on of much hardheartedne&s;&s;e, to breake and melt their Spirits, &s;ince which (ble&s;&s;ed be God) Captaine <HI>Lucus</HI> is come &s;afe in the wild <HI>Beare,</HI> one whom I ob&s;erved in Wexford to be very liberall, tender-hearted, and compa&s;&s;ionate to the poore Souldiers, whereupon I awaked, this dreame la&s;ted about two houres, all which time the &s;torme encrea&s;ed, my Wife told me, that &s;hee jogged me above twenty times to waken me.

<PB N="12" REF="7"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">owne her life for his glory; but my owne heart was then giving thanks and bran full of comfort.</P>
<P>I related my dreame to Lieutenan Col. <HI>Saunders,</HI> Major <HI>Bee, Ben.</HI> and the two Maids that were in the Cabin. And &s;ent in for Captaine <HI>Stoakes,</HI> the Ma&s;ter the Gunner, <HI>Bennet,</HI> and mar&s;hall and bad them be of good cheere, and plye their bu&s;i|ne&s;&s;e for we &s;hould be all &s;afe, telling them what I had dream|ed, they admired at my confidence, and Captaine <HI>Stoakes</HI> could not believe it, (&s;aid he) I know God is very Mercifull and can doe much; but the Ship hath five foot water in the hould which the Pumpe could not reach being choaked, and very &s;ubject to leaks, being twenty years old, and then it was about nine at night, the &s;torme increa&s;ing, and they not knowing where about they were, I told them that I was a&s;&s;ured of &s;afety, as if I were on Shore and one word more I had dreamed, which I told them of &s;aid I to Je&s;us Chri&s;t, what if the Ship &s;hould break a&s;under? He an&s;wered me, you &s;hall be as &s;afe as if you were in <HI>Codds</HI> Boat (a Boat at Wexford that we went in towards the &s;hip in the bay, and were driven back &s;everall times) or as if you were in the Go|vernors hou&s;e in Wexford what impre&s;&s;ion it had upon their Spi|rits I know not, but &s;ome that were in the great Cabbin told me that they did verily beleeve it, and that their hearts were much quieted by what I &s;aid. The &s;torme increa&s;ed and a great noy&s;e was made in the &s;hip, the water came in at the great Cabbine windowes, the &s;hip ready to over&s;et and to founder; many skreaks and cryes out now we are gone, and yet my confidence and a&s;&s;u|rance increa&s;ed, I bad them pray and bethankfull for they were as &s;afe as if they were on &s;hoare &s;till my poore Wife &s;aid it could not be I told her I was &s;ure of it; &s;he mu&s;t lye &s;till and &s;ee the &s;alva|tion of our God.</P>
<P>I confe&s;&s;e I much marvelled at the change that was wrought in my own Spirit, from a trembling fearfulne&s;&s;e to a rejoycing a&s;&s;urance and con&s;idering it was but a dreame I thought I might pre&s;ume too much in an over Confidence and was jealous over my owne hart lea&s;t I &s;hould offend, begging the Lords extraor|dinary a&s;&s;i&s;tance &s;utable to the pre&s;ent danger, but the more I checkt my heart of pre&s;umption; the more did my faith mount upon the wing as if I had been upon dry ground, and had not &s;o much fear as the thou&s;and part of the weight of a haire: the poor &s;hip workt for her life, and the Sea-men took infinite paines, two parts being fallen &s;ick &amp; the other 30. were continually at it, &s;om|times
<PB N="13" REF="7">they were in a little hopes, &s;ometimes their Soules ready to faint about twelve at night, he that was at the Helme by my Cabbin &s;aid all was broken, the water came in there, a little be|fore they cryed out, that the fore&s;aile was &s;plit and carried away, and the Anchors thrown over board to lighten the &s;hip, yet all this while my Spirit was the &s;ame in a thankfull admiration, for &s;o great a deliverance, and &s;aid, all &s;hall be as well as heart could wi&s;h, when they &s;poke of lightning the &s;hip, my wife cald to Capt. <HI>Stoaks</HI> and bad him if he thought fit to throw over &s;ome Trunkes which we had in the &s;hip, which I like very well (as it was in <HI>Pauls</HI>-&s;torm) in regard of others that were in the &s;hip, but for my own part, I &s;aid I would not have any thing throwne over, for I knew all would be well and (&s;o ble&s;&s;ed be the Lord of Seas) about four in the morning, the &s;torme abated, my heart was in a very thankfull po&s;ture, and that Wedne&s;day night after, when the Sea-men &s;aid, we were in mo&s;t danger entring into <HI>Ca&s;tle-Haven</HI> in the dark, that we mu&s;t have the wind turne twice in halfe an houre to &s;ave us, fir&s;t to carry us from the breach of the &s;hoare to the <HI>Staggs,</HI> and then to carry us off from them: when we were within a Cables length of the &s;hoare, and the Sea|men devided, not knowing what to do Captaine <HI>Stoakes</HI> bad let fall an Anchor, or el&s;e we are all dead-men others &s;aib, try to get off from &s;hoare, and there was a great skreak that all was gone, I was not one jot afraid, but told them they were &s;ure to get &s;afe to Land, and the &s;hip to a Harbour, and the Lord &s;hewed him&s;elfe kind to poore &s;inners.</P>
<P>One thing though it &s;eeme to be of &s;mall importance, yet it runs much in my mind, and I mu&s;t needs relate it. I thought that Je&s;us Chri&s;t &s;aid to me that the goods &s;hould be all &s;afe, and nothing hurt or loft by the &s;torme, but when we came to look for our things we mi&s;t a looking-gla&s;&s;e and a Pi&s;toll, the gla&s;&s;e ca&s;e was all broke and &s;hivered in many peeces by the rouling of the &s;hip, being in one of the Boxes or Cabin-che&s;ts in the great Cabbin among&s;t other things but the Gla&s;&s;e it &s;elfe was not &s;o much as broken or crackt and the ca&s;e though in eight or ten peeces yet might ea&s;ily be joyned and glued together, that it is not wor&s;e by a farthing, which &s;eemes to me very admirable, I told Captaine <HI>Stoakes</HI> of it, and de&s;ired him, if po&s;&s;ible, to help me to my Pi|&s;toll, he examined them about it; but it could not be heard of, till the very day the &s;hip was going out of the Harbour, and then &s;omebody that had it could not be quiet till he brought it out,
<PB N="14" REF="8">to let us &s;ee how weak our faith and confidence is in the Lord and that he will performe with his poore &s;ervants to a Title of his promi&s;e.</P>
<P>I know that u&s;ually dreames follow mens naturall inclination or their daily conver&s;ation, as in <HI>Pharaohs Butler</HI> and <HI>Baker,</HI> they dreamed of wine and baskets of meate, matters about which they were ordinarily imployed, <HI>Gen.</HI> 40. and I having beene in a continued meditation of Je&s;us Chri&s;t his love, power, bowells of pitty towards his members, it was mo&s;t likely, that if I dreamed of any thing I &s;hould dreame of him as mary times upon the Sab|boths nights: I have dreamed that I was in the very &s;ame company and at the &s;ame exerci&s;es as I was upon the day, and indeed the con&s;ideration of Chri&s;ts humanity his being at Sea, and his experimentall knowledge of our mi&s;eries much &s;upported me, how many prayers did we put up for a &s;afe pa&s;&s;age which though they do not move the Lord by any eloquence, as an Orator moves his hearers, yet they move the Lord; as the cryes of children make the bowels of thelr Parents yearne towards them, and we mu&s;t di&s;tingui&s;h between &s;hadowes and &s;ub&s;tances, dreames are but the appearances of things which are not, naturall dreams are ei|ther &s;infull, deceitfull &amp; vaine, as <HI>I&s;a.</HI> 29.8. the hungry thir&s;ty man dreames, that he eats and drinks, but he awakes and his &s;oule is faint for food, or el&s;e they are repre&s;entations of things pa&s;t which were really done or things to come which falls out accor|dingly and the matter of the dreame is principally to be regarded, &s;ome Chri&s;tians have had difficult places of Scripture expounded to them in their dreames, as they have told me.</P>
<P>Therefore although dreames which are naturall and ordinary be of little or no account yet extraordinary dreames many times prove true, as if one cry in his dream or be &s;o fa&s;t a&s;lcep that he feels not pinching when the Imagination is &s;o extraordinarily powerfull, and that the party dreaming is confidently per&s;waded that it will come to pa&s;&s;e it commonly proves accordingly as that of <HI>Katherin de Medicis</HI> Queen of France, who dreamed that <HI>Hen.</HI> the Second, &s;hould be killed at the Tilt, and &s;aid &s;he would venture her &s;oule upon it. And &s;o he was killed by a Scots man, <HI>Montgomery</HI> as &s;he dreamed; <HI>Petrarch</HI> in <HI>Pado|va</HI> dreamed that a <HI>Scorpion</HI> &s;tung him to death, that was in one of the Lyons that &s;tand before a &s;tatue which they fondly call <HI>Sancta Iu&s;tina,</HI> the next morning he told his dreame, went thither and put in his hund into the hole and out came a Scorpion which
<PB N="15" REF="8">poy&s;oned him, whereof he dyed, the great Souldier <HI>Fare&s;e</HI> the night before he dyed; dreamed that he was drowned and that his Saint <HI>Chri&s;topher</HI> could not carry him over the River and the next day the Ferry-boat &s;unk and he was drowned.</P>
<P>In 1629. <HI>Chri&s;tina</HI> a Prote&s;tant Marque&s;&s;es Daughter in <HI>Poland,</HI> dreamed that Je&s;us Chri&s;t had told her comfortable things for the Prote&s;tants, as the good &s;ucce&s;&s;e of the King of <HI>Sweden,</HI> the death of the Emperors Generall <HI>Wal&s;ton</HI> and that it might be the better believed, &s;he &s;hould dye four dayes and re|vive againe, one Mini&s;ter <HI>Cotu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">nius</HI> &s;lighted it as a delu&s;ion and vaine fancie, &s;he told him that God was angry with him, and &s;uch a day his only child &s;hould dye and him&s;elfe pre&s;ently after, which both proved true, &s;he likewi&s;e fell into a Trance for eight and fourty houres and then revived and foretold victories of the King of <HI>Sweden,</HI> but that God would take him away, becau&s;e the people began to make a God of him and thought him to be in|vincible. She dreamed that &s;he was married to Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and that &s;he had a Crown of Glory promi&s;ed her if &s;he could per&s;evere in the faith, and told her &s;he would be mockt and &s;coft at by many who would not believe but that &s;uch vi&s;ions procee|ded from imagination, melancholly humours or weakne&s;&s;e of braine, but bad her not be d &s;couraged, &s;hewing her a cup of blood, which he &s;aid he would poure upon tho&s;e that per&s;ecute his &s;ervants, and that &s;he prayed very earne&s;tly for the &s;alvation of a deerfriend of hers who was in armes again&s;t the Prote&s;tants, but that &s;hee could not prevaile for the &s;alvation of any of her friends, but only for her &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">fe and that night the &s;ame party d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">ed, &s;he likewi&s;e in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">er dreame &s;aw two great per&s;ons comming to be judged one a Papi&s;t who had pray <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> much <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">o his St. <HI>Francis</HI> and de&s;ired to be admitted into Heaven, but Je&s;us Chri&s;t bad him go to H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">ll to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">aint <HI>Francis,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> he was immediatly dragged; and the other was a Prow<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="4 letters"> who argued for his &s;al|vation, becau&s;e he fought again&s;t the P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="3 letters">, and the Mini&s;ters a&s;|&s;ured him of Heaver<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter"> Je&s;us Chri&s;t &s;aid <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">e will put out his candle in Germany, for it gives a fa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="3 letters"> light, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 span"> without but it is full of filth and &s;elfe righteou&s;ne&s;&s;e with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 span"> likewi&s;e &s;aw a man upon a Tree adored by many; and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> Lyons came to the Tree and pluckt it down, and an Eagle was flying away, which the Lyons caught, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">oare in pieces, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="2 letters">king Je&s;us Chri&s;t the
