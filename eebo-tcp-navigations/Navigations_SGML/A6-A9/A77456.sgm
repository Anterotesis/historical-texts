<P>_THe Eighth of <HI>May</HI> la&s;t, the <HI>Spa|niards</HI> made good my Intelli|gence to your Honour, by land|ing thirty Captains, thirty Al|feres, and thirty Companies of foot, at a place called <HI>Rio Nova</HI> in the North of this
<PB N="2" REF="2"> I&s;land, who were there about twelve dayes before they were di&s;covered; at which time our Ships plying up and down &s;aw three &s;ail of <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> in that Bay, and made an attempt to have boarded them, but being becalmed could not effect it. That night the <HI>Spaniards</HI> &s;tole away, and our Ships came to acquaint me therewith. I immediatly called a Coun|cill of War, as the affair did importune, and we debated, Whether it were mo&s;t advan|tagious to a&s;&s;ault them pre&s;ently, or let them partake of the di&s;tempers and want of the Country, and when &s;ickne&s;&s;e had weakned them, to attempt them then; though much might have been and was urged, how In|vaders were to be u&s;ed with delayes, &amp;c. yet the exceeding de&s;ire of the Officers and Souldiers to be doing with them, cut off all debates, and determined a &s;udden Re&s;oluti|on to fall upon them before they were For|tified, So I commanded-out 750. Officers
<PB N="3" REF="2"> and Souldiers, and on the 11^t^h of <HI>June</HI> la&s;t, we &s;et &s;ail from this Harbour towards them, and on the 22^t^h in the morning we landing on a Bay, which was defended by two Com|panies and two Captains, within half &s;hot of their Cannon, playing from their Fort; Our Forlorn went on with &s;uch gallantry, and leapt into the water with &s;o much chear|fulne&s;&s;e, that per&s;waded the Enemy they would not be denied entrance, and &s;o they ran, leaving one of their Captains, and about 23. &s;lain, the other we took wounded, who died &s;ince; then we made all the ha&s;t, and in the &s;pace of an hour landed our men, their Cannon playing all the while on us with little &s;ucce&s;&s;e: that day we &s;pent in playing upon their Fort from our Ships, though the place being of &s;o va&s;t a height, they could bear to do them little harm. The next day, under&s;tanding their numbers to be more than ours, we were at a &s;tand how to attempt
<PB N="4" REF="3"> them, having fortified them&s;elves, and ha|ving &s;ix peeces of Ordnance, and a River to to pa&s;&s;e, the depth whereof we knew not; VVherefore, after our Ladders were made, and other things fitted a&s;well as we could, in the evening I &s;ent a Drummer, partly to di&s;cover the depth of the River he was to pa&s;&s;e, with this Summons following;</P>

<P> VVe made no more demurs, but re&s;olved to march the morrow morning. So I or|dered two of our Ve&s;&s;els to &s;et &s;ail Leeward, to per&s;wade them we intend to &s;tand on that &s;ide of them, the other &s;hips to warp as near as they could, and play on them, while we fell on the other &s;ide: We marched a&s;&s;oon as it was light, having two miles to go, being through a VVood on the back&s;ide of them; about a quarter of a mile from their Fort we met a party on a Work, on a high Hill, pre|pared to ob&s;truct our going over the River, who only gave us a fruitle&s;&s;e Volley, ran to their Fort and told them, All the world was coming; we climbed that Hill with much ado, refre&s;hed our wearine&s;s and advanced; when we came in &s;ight of their Fort, which we found, to our exceeding joy, was not fi|ni&s;hed to that height as that to the Seaward: We ordered our bu&s;ine&s;&s;e with our forlorn Ladders and Hand-Granadoes, and with|out
<PB N="7" REF="4"> any further di&s;pute, received their &s;hot and ran up to their Flankers, which, in a quarter of an hour, we gained; many of them made &s;hift to run out of their Works, and ours followed their cha&s;e about three or four miles, doing execution; the Sea|men likewi&s;e, &s;eeing of them run along the Rocks, came out with their Boats and killed many of them.</P>
<P>In this Fort we took about Ten double Barrels of Pouder; Shot, great &s;tore; Six Peeces of Ordnance; great &s;tore of Provi|&s;ions, Wine, Brandie, Salt, Oile, and other Provi&s;ions for eight months, as they termed it.
