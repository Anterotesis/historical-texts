<HEAD>Two great and bloody Fights between the Engli&s;h and the French: the fir&s;t, by Gen. Blake, and the French Cheva|liers, near the I&s;les of Majorca, which continued for the &s;pace of 24 houres: the &s;econd, at the I&s;le of St. Chri&s;to|phers, by Gen. Pen, and Moun&s;ieur de Poince; with the &s;ubduing of all the French in De la Martinicque, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>_THe French having for &s;ome yeares la&s;t pa&s;t made an incur&s;ion into the I&s;les of St. Chri&s;tophers, and de la Martinic|que, at which time they became Ma|&s;ters thereof, and &s;ubdued the Engli&s;h, keeping them as Va&s;&s;als and &s;laves, and expo&s;ing them to
<PB N="4" REF="3">mo&s;t inhumane cruelties and tortures; &s;o that many hone&s;t men were deprived of all Earthly Comforts and Enjoyments, till it plea&s;ed God to u&s;e a means for their deliverance; by who&s;e Series of Providence, great things have been ma|nife&s;ted and done for the Engli&s;h Nation at home, and now more e&s;pecially for his people abroad; as appeares by the&s;e en&s;uing Demon|&s;trations, viz.</P>
<P>General Pen, and General Venables having &s;teered their Coa&s;t for the We&s;tern I&s;lands, at la&s;t bare up towards St. Chri&s;tophers, and wheel|ing off to the South-we&s;t Point, tacked about for the I&s;le De la Martinicque, where Major Gene|ral Haines 'tis &s;aid landed with &s;o con&s;iderable a party, that in &s;even hours time he became wholly Ma&s;ter of all that was held by the French, po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed their Plantations, and &s;eized their Goods, &s;ecured the pri&s;oners, which are &s;aid to be 735, and placed his Gari&s;ons: Since which time, we hear, that they have &s;ummoned Mon&s;ieur de Poince (Governour for the King of France in St. Chri&s;tophers I&s;land) who is re&s;olved, if they a&s;|&s;ail him, to &s;ell their lives at a dear rate, and that no conditions &s;hal be acceptable, though never
<PB N="5" REF="3">&s;o equal, for that he wil rather chu&s;e to die, then fal&s;ifie his Loyalty.</P>
<P>The Engli&s;h Generals are now upon that coa&s;t and intend (by Gods permi&s;&s;ion) &s;uddenly to make an Attempt: VVhich the Governour un|der&s;tanding, hath cau&s;ed to be rai&s;ed great Bul|works and Fortifications, and thereupon planted many gallant pieces of Ordnance; &s;o that the work to &s;ome may &s;eem to be difficult, but fea&s;i|ble enough to &s;uch heroical Spirits, who are bra&s;s within, and &s;teel without; the Engli&s;h being thus characterized by the French pri&s;oners.</P>
<P>And thus it appears they are; for from St. Ma|los they write, That divers of the French Mer|chant men returning from Provence, lad<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">n with Commodities, and convoyed by five men of war, hapned to meet with an Engli&s;h frigat, who after 8 hours fight, &s;unk 3 of them; but being &s;o lamen+tably rent and torn, and exceedingly over-powr|ed, &s;he at la&s;t gave them another broad &s;ide, and by &s;inking of one down by her &s;ide, &s;he charged through and &s;o e&s;caped; in which Di&s;pute, the enemy were &s;o extreamly battered and &s;hattered, that not one of them dur&s;t attempt a pur&s;uit, this frigat had not &s;ailed many Leagues, but &s;he met
<PB N="6" REF="4">with an O&s;tender, who perceiving her to be very much impaired, bare up clo&s;e to her, pre&s;enting her with three broad &s;ides, one after another: the Engli&s;h frigat an|&s;wered them again, and plyed them &s;o clo&s;e with great and &s;mal &s;hot, that after four or five hours fight, the enemy decli|ned Engagement, and ran aground, where the men all peri&s;hed, excepting four, who narrowly e&s;caping &s;hipwrack, at la&s;t got to St. Malows.</P>
<P>To the&s;e great Atchievments, may be added the renowned Victory of General Blake, which according to the mo&s;t true inteligence is thus repre&s;ented, viz. That the &s;aid General having &s;ent forth a &s;qua|dron of &s;hips towards the I&s;lands of Ma|jorca and Minorca, after &s;ome Leagues pa&s;t, they e&s;pyed &s;ome &s;hips under &s;ayl, who making towards them, the other tac|ked
<PB N="7" REF="4">about, opened their Ports, put forth their Guns, manned their Decks, and pre|pared to fight them: &s;o that bearing up to each other, the Chevalier de Valie Commander of the French Van, di&s;char|ged two broad &s;ides, and was an&s;wered a|gain: He bare up the &s;econd time, but came off with abundance of lo&s;&s;e; for he was &s;o gored by the Unicorn, that his &s;hip &s;prung a Leak, having at lea&s;t five foot Water in the Hold; be&s;ides his main Ma&s;t, Bolt&s;prit and Mi&s;ne, vvere cut off, by Iron bars, and Chain &s;hot, &s;o that he cau&s;ed his &s;hip to run aground, by vvhich meanes, he &s;aved him&s;elf, his trea&s;ure, and &s;even more in a Long boat, the re&s;t peri|&s;hed, and about 150 vvere &s;lain and taken pri&s;oners.</P>
<PB N="8" REF="5">
<P>During which time of Action, the Chevalier de la Landes, who commantled the re&s;t of the French &s;hips, were not in the lea&s;t declining, but after 24 hours bloody Conflict, was boarded and taken, and not a &s;hip that belonged to him e&s;ca|ped. The&s;e two Commanders were accounted the chief Hectors in tho&s;e parts, and &s;cornd but to bid defiance to the proude&s;t Foe that ever &s;ayled upon the &s;ea, having vanqui&s;hed in their time a|bove 150 &s;ayl of men of war; and yet at the la&s;t &s;ubdued with nine Engli&s;h Frigats, and the lo&s;s of 37 men; as the be&s;t Intelligence, of the&s;e Times affirmeth.</P>
