<HEAD>A LETTER FROM A Gentleman in <HI>AMERICA,</HI> to his Friend in <HI>SCOTLAND.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><HI>BOLSTON</HI> <DATE><HI>November</HI> 8th. 1699.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Wrote to you from <HI>Jamaica,</HI> giving account of the Shameful De&s;ertion of <HI>Caledonia:</HI> I doubt not but long ere now, the Company is &s;en&s;ible of the true Cau&s;e, and hath taken Care to prevent the like for the Fu|ture: It &s;eems &s;trange, that Per&s;ons of known Integrity, Courage, and Experience, could not be &s;ent and Commi&s;&s;ionat for the Management of a Concern of &s;o Great Importance. Whatever may be the Di&s;cour&s;e of their want of Provi&s;ions, I know very well we have &s;uch Friends in the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Plan|tations, as contrary to any Proclamation or Prohibition, would have &s;upplyed and may yet &s;upply, the &s;aid Colony, with all nece&s;&s;ar Provi&s;ions, if they have timely Notice and Encouragement from the Company.</P>
<P>One of the two Ships that were &s;ent with a Supply of 300 Men, hath been at <HI>Caledonia,</HI> and is come to <HI>Jamaica:</HI> We long to hear of the Recruits expect|ed with the <HI>Ri&s;ing-Sun:</HI> And hope when they Arrive, they may Re-&s;ettle the Place. Its al&s;o hoped for, and thought nece&s;&s;ar, that the Company do not give over, as if no more were requi&s;it for &s;ecuring the Colony (Its well known the <HI>Spani&s;h, French,</HI> and Others, will u&s;e all their Art, Fraud, and Force, to Hinder, Undermine, and Ruin it) but that they continue their Supplies of Men, Arms, <HI>&amp;c:</HI> untill they be Certified their Colony is beyond Danger from all their Enemies.</P>
<P>We hope the great Lo&s;s &s;u&s;tained, &s;hall not Di&s;courage nor abate the Zeal of any Concerned: Such undertakings do not pre&s;ently Ripen and Enrich the Adventurers: What tho the Company &s;ee no Return for Seven Years? The Place is worth Ten times the Charge: And in time will fully re-imbur&s;e them, if Mountains of Gold, or being the Staple of Trade for both &s;ides of <HI>America,</HI> can do it; Be&s;ides the Ble&s;&s;ing of Heaven, which we may expect to the Me&s;&s;engers of the glad Tidings of Salvation to People in Darkne&s;s.</P>
