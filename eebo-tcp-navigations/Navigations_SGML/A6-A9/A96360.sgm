But the Seas are not Guarded, and which is wor&s;e, the Honour of the Seas is lo&s;t and &s;hamefully lo&s;t. The truth is for want of Victuall and o|ther due Incouragements (that is, for want of their Thirds, <GAP DESC="missing" EXTENT="1 page"></P>

<P>This <HI>Journall</HI> &s;hewes You, how tho&s;e great Ships were In|countred, di&s;&s;ipated, and de&s;troyed by the <HI>Hollanders,</HI> though <HI>Englands</HI> Royall Navie endeavoured &s;eriou&s;ly to protect and defend them.</P>
<P>With the&s;e Spectacles you may &s;ee cleerly, that Great &s;lug|gi&s;h Ships, mann'd with Land-men, are not &s;erviceable for this State.</P>
<P>That fleet of <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Ships, was much greater in Number, Tonnes, Men and Ordnance, then <HI>Englands</HI> Navie is, or ever was, but Maugre their Greatne&s;&s;e, and Number. That Fleet was Incountred, and in a few houres, &s;cattered and Con|founded by the <HI>Hollanders,</HI> in their &s;mall Ships; for excepting &s;ome few, which of late yeares they have fondly framed in Imitation of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Navie, (that is, for Countenance) All their Men of war, are &s;mall Ships, and doe carry but one Tyre of Ordnance.</P>
<P>I &s;ay in a few houres, they &s;o confounded the Great <HI>Spa|ni&s;h</HI> Ships, that &s;carce one of ten Returned into <HI>Spayne.</HI></P>
<P>In this Great and memorable Fight, &s;ome of the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Ships were Burnt, &s;ome were Sunck, and &s;ome were taken.

<P>If you compare the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Armado, which came into <HI>England,</HI> in the yeare 1639. To that which came again&s;t <HI>Eng|land,</HI> in the yeare 1588.

<ITEM>This la&s;t Report is very remarkable, it is of a greater Concernment then all the Pa&s;&s;ages in this booke; By it you may know, that <HI>Englands</HI> Navie is Contemp|table, and mu&s;t come behind.</ITEM>
<ITEM>That the great Ships which were prepared at <HI>London</HI> and <HI>Chatham,</HI> to ayd Sir <HI>Iohn Penington,</HI> were &s;o long Wind-bound, that the Fight was ended three dayes be|fore they came into the <HI>Downes.</HI> This mi&s;chiefe is u&s;uall, and therefore very con&s;i|derable.

<ITEM>That in all the Fights which were betwixt the <HI>Hollanders</HI> and the <HI>Spanyards,</HI> the <HI>Hollanders</HI> were to Windward of the <HI>Spanyards;</HI> which is the greate&s;t Advantage that any Ship can have of her Adver&s;ary. Page, 42</ITEM>
<ITEM>That when the la&s;t great Fight began, Thirty of the <HI>Hollanders</HI> were to Wind|ward of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Fleet, which in my opinion was a high Pre&s;umption.

Page, 44.</ITEM>
<ITEM>The Conclu&s;ion of the&s;e Ob&s;ervotions is, That <HI>Van Tromp</HI> violated his Promi&s;e in falling upon <HI>Oquendoes</HI> Fleet in the Kings Road. Hee did not keepe his Pro|mi&s;e with Sir <HI>Iohn Penington;</HI> For which affront, it had been equall and ju&s;t, that <HI>Englands</HI> Admirall &s;hould have taken the &s;ame Liberty when hee was with the Parliaments Ships, at the <HI>Gorey</HI> in <HI>Holland.</HI> But no more of That.</ITEM>

<PB N="17" REF="14">that he never mentioned, &s;hould not, but that his Admirall had added that unto the me&s;&s;age that he brought him, and as I conceived thereby the better to cleer him&s;elf from his neglect of &s;ending &s;ome &s;hips to Ride in the Cha|nells to the Northwards as afore&s;aid, But <HI>Cats</HI> dur&s;t not openly deny it, fort hen he &s;hould have given his Admirall the lye: &s;o the fault was wholly laid upon Capt. <HI>Cats,</HI> with the which an&s;wer we returned.

<P>But he doubted that rather then the States would have any difference with his Maje&s;ty they would leave him to the mercy of the King, and then &s;aid he it may be that I may be hanged for my good &s;ervice. Wherefore he re&s;olved not to begin nor
<PB N="18" REF="15">do any thing in the Road unle&s;&s;e they gave him warrant for it; al&s;o in our di&s;cour&s;e he demanded of me how many &s;hips we had of the Kings and Marchant men that we had taken up in the Road?

Sayle of the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Galeons and hoped of more taken by &s;ome &s;hips of his, and had fired the <HI>Portugals</HI> Admirall as is formerly mentioned, and how that <HI>Don Lopus de O&s;&s;a</HI> the Commander of that &s;hip, and his Company did &s;hew them&s;elves brave Sol|diers, for her lower Ordnance continued playing vpon them when the fire was at their Top-ma&s;ts head; al&s;o he &s;aid that they &s;aved of the <HI>Spanyards</HI> that lept overbord nere 70 men, who did certify him, that <HI>Don Lopus,</HI> albeit he was a man of above 70 years of age, and had his arme &s;hot of in the begin|ing of the fight, yet hee continued above vpon the upper deek, Incouraging of his men to fight it out unto the la&s;t, vntill
<PB N="50" REF="31">the fire &s;eazed vpon him, who&s;e death he did much lament. Al|&s;o he &s;aid, that the prime Admirall <HI>Don Anthony do Oquendo,</HI> never Cut his Main&s;ayle nor let fall his Sprit &s;ayle, but conti|nued by his con&s;ort <HI>Don Lopus</HI> &s;o long as he could &s;uccor him, but when he &s;ee him fired, and pa&s;t hopes of Reliefe, he made all the Saile that he could and with the Admirall of <HI>Donkerke</HI> &amp; divers other &s;hips of his fleet, he ran away to the we&s;twards.</P>
<P>Before midnight the wind We&s;tered &s;o, that &s;o farre as they were a head of the <HI>Hollanders,</HI> &s;o much they were to windwards of them; yet the <HI>Hollanders</HI> plyed too and fro all the night, expecting, that on the morrow, by &s;hift of wind, they might recover them.</P>
<P>But in the Morning not one of them were in &s;ight &s;o that he thought that they had got <HI>Donkirk.</HI> But &s;aid hee, I hope ere long to Burne both him and all his Fleet, as they ride in the Road under the Splinter. A|mong&s;t other di&s;cour&s;e with him, I did Inquire for my Friend Cap|taine <HI>Forran</HI> a French Captaine formerly mentioned, and how he had behaved him&s;elfe in the fight, he an&s;wered me, that he was a &s;tout man of Warre, and &s;aid that if &s;o be that all his Captains had bin &s;uch as he was, they might have done more then they did.</P>
<P>But hee imployed him about a bu&s;ine&s;&s;e of Con&s;equence, otherwayes he had been in the Road. Which was as J was afterward informed, to take the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Galeon that rode in <HI>Dover</HI> Road. The which Ser|vice he performed; for the next day there came Complaints unto our Admirall, that &s;he was taken out of the Road in the night and carried away, which was impo&s;&s;ible for us to prevent; For the <HI>Hollands</HI> Fleet did ride in the mid-way betweene the <HI>Spanyard</HI> and our Fleet.</P>
<P>After which hee demanded of vs, what was the &s;tate of all the <HI>Span|yards</HI> that were run a&s;hore vpon the &s;trand, we an&s;wered that the grea|te&s;t part of them were Sunke and &s;plitt, &s;o that they would come to the Country People according as he had de&s;tined them at his fir&s;t Coming hither, and that the <HI>hamborgers</HI> and <HI>Lubikers</HI> had po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of ther &s;hips di&s;charged their Souldiers and for the re&s;t they were &s;ould, and po&s;&s;e&s;t by Engli&s;h men, which was Related by his Order before all his Cap|tains that were abord with him which were at lea&s;t 20 or 30 of them vpon which bee &s;aid that hee was glad that the Engli&s;h had &s;o much Benefit by them, and al&s;o, that thereby hee was free from being In|gaged, to fetch them from the &s;hore, and from among&s;t our fleet, as &s;ome of his other Captaines had made a motion to have him doe; for &s;aith he I might thereby have given his Maje&s;tie, and the whole Fleet
<PB N="51" REF="31">of England more di&s;ta&s;t, then with all that he had formerly done, the which he would be very loath to doe, But if &s;o be that the Engli&s;h had not had po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of them, By the In&s;tigation of the re&s;t of his Fleet, he mu&s;t have bin forced to put it to a hazard.</P>
<P>To which we an&s;wered, that our &s;trength was now increa&s;t, and we did expect more before many houres; &s;o that hee would find it a wor&s;e bought then all, which proved accordingly; for before Night there came into the <HI>Downes</HI> foure of his Maje&s;ties Ships of the &s;econd Rank and one of the third Ranke, and Six of the be&s;t <HI>&s;traights</HI> Merchants Ships that were in the River of <HI>Thames.</HI> The wind after-noone at N. N.W. After our comming abord to Sir <HI>John,</HI> and relating what we had heard and &s;ayd, hee &s;ent Captain <HI>Slinsby</HI> and my &s;elfe a&s;hore unto the Spani&s;h Vice-Admirall <HI>Don Andrewes de Ca&s;tro,</HI> To certifie him of all what wee had heard from the <HI>Hollanders</HI> and how that wee had Informed them that all his Ships that were a-&s;loat, were in the po&s;|fe&s;&s;ion of the <HI>Engli&s;h.</HI> By which meanes, wee had diverted them from their Re&s;olutions, which was, to have come and taken them all away with them, which would have co&s;t him a Bloody no&s;e, at lea&s;t. Al&s;o we certified him, that our Admirall was &s;orry to heare of the ba&s;e Ca|riage of the Country people towards him and his Men, the which was come to his Maje&s;ties knowledge; for the Earle of <HI>Northumberland</HI> b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">d Intimated &s;o much in a Packet to our Admirall, and that his Ma|je&s;ty would have him to take care that they &s;hould not &s;uffer any wrong by any of his Subjects. The which our Admirall would endea|vour to performe, &s;o farre forth as his Power would reach, which was no further then the Road, but hee had no Command upon the Land, al&s;o J gave him notice that J had Order from our Admirall, to goe abord of his Ship and the re&s;t of the Wacks upon the &s;hore, to looke after them; that no man &s;hould Imbezell any thing from them, and to forbid all men what&s;oever, except it were &s;uch as were hyred to by his Sub&s;titutes, upon peyne of his Maje&s;ties di&s;plea&s;ure, not to take any thing out of tho&s;e <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Ships a-ground; for the which and all former, hee returned mo&s;t hearty thankes to our Admirall.</P>
<P>In the Morning the wind was at N. by W. a &s;taffe gale, before day a Packet came from the Lord Admirall, and by a order therein I was Sent a &s;hore to the Spani&s;h Vice-admirall to give him to under&s;tand, that our Admirall had Order to Convoy his Souldiers for <HI>Flanders,</HI> if he did &s;hip them in <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Bottoms, he An&s;wered that hee did expect &s;ome Ve&s;&s;els from <HI>Donkerk</HI> for to tran&s;port them; But if they came not
<PB N="52" REF="32">he did intend to provide ve&s;&s;els at <HI>Dover,</HI> and then he would thankfully Imbrace our Admiralls Convoy. About noone all the <HI>Hollands</HI> fleet &s;et Sayle and run to the We&s;twards about the Foreland, and then <HI>Don Andrewes</HI> gave Order to all his &s;hips that were a-float and rid neare the &s;hore to goe Ride farther of. At night the wind We&s;tward and pro|ved very fayre wether all night, and all the next day afternoone all the <HI>Hollands</HI> fleet came Open of the Forland abord, and bore about on the back&s;ide of the <HI>Goodwin,</HI> and &s;tood away mo&s;t of them towards the Ea&s;t of <HI>Holland</HI> and the re&s;t towards <HI>Flanders.</HI> At night Captaine <HI>Hall</HI> Re|turned from his Maje&s;tie, who had certified his Maje&s;tie of all the pro|ceedigns which had hapned betwixt the <HI>Spanyards</HI> and the <HI>Hollanders.</HI> Next morning came a Complaint unto our Admirall that divers of the Boats of his Fleet had bin abord of the wracks, and had Imbezelled and taken out their Provi&s;ions; upon which our Admirall gave Order to Capt. <HI>Hall,</HI> Capt. <HI>Stradling,</HI> Capt. <HI>Ramsby,</HI> Capt. <HI>Cartwright,</HI> and my &s;elfe, &amp;c. To goe abord of all the Fleet, and to &s;earch them, having with us two Spani&s;h Captaines likewi&s;e to accompany us. In our &s;earch wee found more or le&s;&s;e abord of every Ship, &s;ome of the Span|yards provi&s;ions, the which was carried by the &s;ayd Ships-boats abord of the St. <HI>Augu&s;tine,</HI> and the <HI>Crowne,</HI> two of the Spani&s;h &s;hips. But for the Anchors and Cables that wee had taken up, that they Cut away in the Road, tho&s;e wee detayned abord untill farther Order from the Lord Admirall. But wee would not &s;uffer the <HI>Deal</HI> Pilots to meddle with any one of the Anchors. At Night there came a Packet from the Lord Admirall, that wee &s;hould not &s;uffer any one to meddle with an Anchor or Wrack, if they were &s;o neare the &s;hore, as that a Hor&s;eman riding into the Sea at low water could reach it with his Launce or Speare, and that wee &s;hould not meddle with any thing within that li|mit; for that Priviledge did belong to the Lord Warden, or to the Lords of the Manner. Likewi&s;e there came another Packet, for the Ships that were lately &s;ent downe, to returne to <HI>Chatham,</HI> and the Ships which were &s;ent from <HI>London</HI> to returne to <HI>London;</HI> onely the Winter guard, &s;o there was none left but the Winter guard.</P>
<P>The next day, Captaine <HI>Slingsby</HI> carried over the Spani&s;h Ma&s;ter <HI>Delda Campo;</HI> And the &s;ame day, there came over Eight <HI>Dunkirke</HI> Sloopes, who carried away foure hundred Souldiers, that &s;et &s;ayle in the after-noone.</P>
<P>The next day, all the Ships had their Warrants to take the fir&s;t op|portunity of wind and wether to returne from whence they came.</P>
