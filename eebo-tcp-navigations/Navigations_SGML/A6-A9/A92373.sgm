<P>In the fore&s;aid Attaque was the Ship of L.

But betwixt &s;even &amp; eight of the clock in the evening one more of the capitall <HI>English</HI> Ships of the Blew E&s;quadron, car|rying by e&s;timation betwixt 60. or 70. Guns, beeing pa&s;t by the Ship of the <HI>Generall de Ruyter</HI> about a Musket shot, went to the ground; Both which <HI>English</HI> Ships &s;unk clo&s;e by &amp; even among&s;t the <HI>Nei|therlands</HI> Fleet, &s;o as the &s;ame was perfectly &s;eene by very many Of|ficers, Private Seamen &amp; Souldiers, beeing donne before their eyes &amp; remarqued by them; but it cannot certainly bee affirmed whether any other <HI>English</HI> Ships might be &s;unke or de&s;troyd that day: But towards evening the Reare Adm. of the White beeing a capitall Ship of war &amp; made very un&s;erviceable by <HI>Gen. de Ruyters</HI> &amp; others shot, there was commanded upon him one of the Fireships of the <HI>Gen. de Ruyters</HI> E&s;|quadron, which being gotten onboard him &amp; pre&s;ently &s;et on fire, the &s;aid Fireship was forth with &s;unke; whereupon a &s;econd Fireship out of the <HI>Zeelands</HI> E&s;quadron did likewi&s;e come onboard the &s;aid R. Adm. and &s;et him on fire but the &s;aid R. Adm. cleared him&s;elfe &amp; each time found meanes to put out the fire in his Ship. A third <HI>Neither|lands</HI> Fireship under the favour of the Guns of the L. Adm. <HI>Cornelius E|vert&s;on</HI> endeavouring to lay the &s;aid R. Adm. onboard was before hee
<PB N="7" REF="5">was fa&s;t, shott to ground and &s;unk, &s;o that according to the a|greeing witne&s;s of all the <HI>Neitherlands</HI> Officers which were there a|bouts, the often mentioned Reare Admirall of the White, with a &s;pe|ciall con&s;tancy, as an honorable Souldier hath quitted him&s;elfe: And it is the more to be admired becau&s;e that [according to the witnes of &s;ome <HI>English</HI> Pri&s;oners who leaped out of his ship into the &s;ea, &amp; were &s;aved by the <HI>Neitherlands</HI> Ships at what time the forefaid two fir&s;t Fi|reships came onboard him] beeing on fire, three hundred of his Seamen, accounting the matter de&s;perate (and to decline the fire) leaped over board, and cho&s;e the water. Out of the fore&s;aid Reare Admirall in the evening late an unhappy shott was made which tooke out of the world the valiant L. Adm. <HI>Cornelius Evert&s;on,</HI> who&s;e good conduct and courage in many foregoeing occa&s;ions, as al&s;o in this was experimented; and thereuppon for that time was the fight parted by the Night, &s;oe that through the darknes in the &s;mook and damp, it could not bee marked whether the fore&s;aid Reare Adm. might be &s;unk or have cleared and &s;aved him&s;elfe.</P>
<P>The Night beeing pa&s;t the <HI>English</HI> Fleete on the 12 Iune 1666 with breake of Day was to windward above the <HI>Neitherlands</HI> Fleete about a league &amp; halfe; the wind then beeing We&s;t South We&s;t, at which time both the Fleetes againe laid one towards the other, to wit, the <HI>Neitherlands</HI> Fleet Northwe&s;t and the <HI>English</HI> South over: So &s;oone as the two Fleetes, were approached nigh each other, the <HI>Neither|lands</HI> Fleete did al&s;o ly towards the South to &s;tand the &s;ame cour&s;e with the enemy. But the <HI>English</HI> &s;etting a&s;ide the advantage of the wind bore up uppon the <HI>Neitherlands</HI> Fleet and accordingly did run before the wind among&s;t their enemies, the <HI>Neitherlanders</HI> keeping their cour&s;e and bideing uppon a wind, running over again&s;t them, &s;oe that both Fleets did in this manner pa&s;&s;e with a heavy and sharp fight, without lo&s;eing any one &s;ingle Ship of the <HI>Neitherlanders.</HI></P>
<P>Nor can any of the <HI>Neitherlands</HI> Officers as yet give te&s;timony to the <HI>Deputies</HI> and <HI>Plenipotentiaries,</HI> of the <HI>States Generall,</HI> that of a cer|teynty any of the <HI>English</HI> Ships were taken or de&s;troid in the &s;aid ren|contre. The Fleets being pa&s;t each other in this manner &amp; on both
<PB N="8" REF="6">&s;ides many Ships in their &s;tanding &amp; running rigging much dama|ged by shott, each with &s;pliceing, wallknotting and otherwi&s;e againe &s;ought to make fitt, &amp; there uppon it beeing faln quite &s;till, both Fleets lay and drove in a calme till about 11. of the clock before noone: When the gale increa&s;ing both Fleets laid towards each other (the <HI>Neitherlanders</HI> then beeing to Windward) and againe fell into a very furious fight. The <HI>Generallde Ruyter</HI> being advanced about halfe way in the <HI>English</HI> Fleete, heard in the mid&s;t of the &s;ame very fu|rious shooteing, and from thence pre&s;umeing that &s;ome Ships of the Fleete under him mu&s;t bee in a &s;treight &amp; totally &s;urrounded by the enemy re&s;olved with his E&s;quadron under him to fall in; And hee pre&s;ently bearing up ran in among&s;t the enemy, who uppon his comeing makeing &s;ome roome, hee &s;aw and found that the <HI>L. Ad|mirall Tromp,</HI> then in per&s;on beeing in and letting fly his flagg uppon the Ship of <HI>Jacob Cornelius Swart,</HI> had with a &s;ouldiers heart broken in there, and together with <HI>Vice- Admirall van der Hul&s;t, Captain Pe|ter Salomon&s;on, De Haen,</HI> and <HI>van Amstell,</HI> lay very much di&s;en|abled &s;urrounded by the enemy: All which without the afore&s;ayd &s;uccor were in great danger to bee burned or &s;unk, as indeed the fore|mentioned Ship of <HI>Peter Salomon&s;on</HI> was at the comeing of the fore|&s;aid &s;uccour already on fyre and thereby then lo&s;t. The afore&s;ayd Captayn and a good part of his &s;eamen were in utmo&s;t perill and ju&s;t in their Extremity &s;aved by the <HI>Neitherlanders;</HI> But it plea&s;ed God that hee (beeing gone over upon the Ship of Captayn <HI>Schey,</HI> and there according to his power doeing worthily,) dyed during the battell in the bed of honour.</P>
<P>The afore&s;aid Ship of <HI>Capt. Swart,</HI> &amp; of the aforenamed three other Captains, were, dureing the time of the &s;aid &s;urrounding made &s;o un&s;erviceable, that the <HI>L. Admiral Tromp</HI> was nece&s;&s;itated again to goe over upon another Ship; And the aforenamed Ships of Vice-Admirall <HI>van der Hulst,</HI> &amp; the fore&s;aid <HI>Capt. de Haen, Swart</HI> &amp; <HI>van Am&s;tel,</HI> as being wholly unu&s;efull, mu&s;t bee &s;ent up to the fir&s;t &amp; fittinge&s;t heavens. In the afore&s;aid throng among&s;t others Vice-Admirall <HI>van der Hulst</HI> was al&s;o shot dead, who in all occa&s;ions had
<PB N="9" REF="6">carryed &amp; leported him&s;elfe as a brave Souldier &amp; under&s;tanding Of|ficer. Yet it plea&s;ed God the Lord in a short time doubly to repayr the fore&s;aid lo&s;s &amp; dammage of the Ships of the States of the <HI>Vnited Neitherlands;</HI> for many of the <HI>English</HI> Fleet were the &s;ame day &s;unk &amp; burned. Among&s;t which there is remayning the perfect knowledge &amp; notice of the&s;e following Ships: Namely,</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, One of the E&s;quadron of the <HI>Red,</HI> beeing according to ghe&s;&s;e a Ship of about 60 Guns, &s;unk about noon among&s;t the fore|mo&s;t Ships or in the van of the <HI>English</HI> Fleet.</P>
<P>Secondly, One of the Blew E&s;quadron, carrying by ghe&s;&s;e be|tween 50 &amp; 60 Guns, &s;unk about three of the clock in the after|noon, after hee had pa&s;&s;ed by <HI>General de Ruyter,</HI> &amp; in pa&s;&s;ing by him was duely &s;aluted.</P>
<P>Thirdly, One of the <HI>White</HI> E&s;quadron, carrying according to ghe&s;&s;e near 50 Guns, a little time after was &s;unk by the &s;yde of Vice-Admirall <HI>de Liefde,</HI> who had &s;o boared him through with his Canon that he went to the ground.</P>
<P>Fourthly, One of the E&s;quadron of the <HI>White Flag,</HI> carrying about 50 Guns by computation, about halfe an hour after was &s;unk in the E&s;quadron of <HI>General de Ruyter,</HI> a little behind the Ship of <HI>Capt. van Meewen,</HI> who gave him a full lower tyre in pa&s;&s;ing by. And that it may certainly bee concluded that both the fore&s;aid Ships of the <HI>White</HI> E&s;quadron, are two di&s;tinct Ships it is to be noted that many Of|ficers &amp; &s;eamen &s;aw the one as wel as the other ruined: to wit, the &s;ame per&s;ons that had &s;een the one &s;unk &s;aw the other &s;unk al&s;o a short time after: whereof examination is carefully made to be &s;ure that one &amp; the &s;ame Ship should not bee taken for two di&s;tinct Ships.</P>
<P>Fifthly, The Ship the <HI>Black Eagle,</HI> or <HI>Armes of Groening,</HI> beeing the la&s;t Autumne (after that the <HI>Neitherlands</HI> Fleet by an heavy &s;torm were di&s;&s;ipated from each other,) met by the <HI>English</HI> &amp; taken; which fore&s;aid Ship the <HI>Black Eagle</HI> was &s;unk, <HI>Capt. Marrevelt</HI> having with fore-con&s;ideration prepared &amp; fyred his whole broad&s;ide upon it.</P>
<P>Sixtly, Another <HI>English</HI> Ship &s;unk in the midde&s;t of the <HI>English</HI> Fleet, after he had &s;ayled for &s;ome time with a Flag of di&s;tre&s;&s;e with|out any mans comeing to his help.</P>
<PB N="10" REF="7">
<P>In the afore&s;aid two dayes as al&s;o in the fight of the fourth day (of with hereafter shall bee further &s;poken) there were undoubtedly &s;e|verall English Ships burned of which neverthele&s;&s;e no full certeynty of te&s;timony can be given, in regard that &s;ome &s;yre Ships were &s;et on fyre &amp; yet it cannot bee perfectly &s;aid whether the Ships which they were aboard of were burned or that they cleered them&s;elves. Except onely two <HI>English</HI> Ships, which many bee certainly affirmed dureing the fight to bee burned, one uppon the &s;econd the other uppon the fourth day of the fore&s;aid Battel, for as much as the <HI>Neitherlands</HI> Offi|cers and Seamen that &s;erved uppon the Fireships, come in with good certificates to obtaine their &s;etled reward for that &s;ervice.</P>
<P>When the <HI>English Pri&s;oners</HI> fisht out of the Sea, and &s;ent to the re|&s;pective Colledges of Admiraltyes, shall bee perfectly examined to un|der&s;tand out of what Ships they are particulary &s;aved, undoubtedly yet more of the burned and &s;unk <HI>English</HI> Ships will bee di&s;covered.</P>
<P>The Fight of the fore&s;aid 12. of Iune, was very fierce e&s;pecially in the afternoon, &s;o that many Ships on both &s;ides were very much damni|fyed in their Ma&s;ts, ropma&s;ts, &s;ayles &amp; rigging: Among&s;t others about 3 or 4 of the clock in the afternoon was the main Topma&s;t of <HI>Gen. de Ruyters</HI> Ship shott downe falling with Flagg &amp; pendant from above. Hee there uppon being &s;omething unfitted gave order pre&s;ently to L. Admirall <HI>van Nes</HI> in meane while till that another Topma&s;t should bee &s;et againe to lett fly the pendent under his Flagg, &amp; for that time to acte as <HI>Generall,</HI> orderly to pro&s;ecute the fight. The which al&s;o was followed by him with &s;uch courage &amp; conduct that both Fleets came up three times one towards the other that afternoon &amp; &s;o hav|ing pa&s;&s;ed each other towards the evening when the <HI>Neitherlands</HI> fleet had turned the fourth time toward the <HI>English</HI> they followed their cour&s;e &amp; with all their &s;ayles made towards their owne coa&s;t; they body beeing le&s;&s;ened toeight or nine &amp; thirty men of warre; the <HI>Neith|erlands</HI> Fleet &s;tanding towards them (who were by their tacking got a good way a&s;terne,) did u&s;e all po&s;&s;ible endeavour to fetch them up, to that end makeing all the &s;ayle they could. But the night &amp; calme co|meing up, were, next to Gods will, the cau&s;e that the <HI>Neitherlands</HI> Fleet
