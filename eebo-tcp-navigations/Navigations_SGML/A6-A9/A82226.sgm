<OPENER><SALUTE>Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>our Treaty with this de&s;perate enemy is now ended and the Ca&s;tle delivered up to us, I &s;hall give you a brief relation of the whole proceed thereupon. Upon Munday morning la&s;t their Commi&s;&s;ioners (ac|cording to leave given them) came out of the Ca&s;tle, our Commi&s;&s;ioners &s;hewed them the Articles that we would grant them upon &s;urrender thereof; which when they had read, one of them did &s;wear (and the re&s;t con|curred therein) that they would hold it out to the la&s;t moment thkt their provi&s;ions la&s;ted, and when tho&s;e were done, they would eat their hor&s;es, and after them their pri&s;oners, before they would be &s;o perfidious to deliver their Governour, or any other of the &s;ix de|manded by them to Ju&s;tice; but this they offered (up|on a &s;econd debate) that they would &s;urrender the Ca&s;tle on Wedn&s;day next, and if the &s;ix per&s;ons de|manded could e&s;cape by force or othrrwi&s;e, that it &s;hould be adjudged lawfull, and no breach of the Ar|t cles, which at la&s;t was a&s;&s;ented unto, the Articles were then that night wholly concluded on by the Com|mi&s;&s;iners on both &s;ides; the &s;ub&s;tance thus: that all Officers and souldiers, except the &s;ix per&s;ons before excepted) &s;hould have pa&s;&s;es to go to their &s;everall homes, there to live quietly without mole&s;tation, and protections for &s;o doing, they &s;ubmitting to all orders ordinances, and Acts of Parliament; and &s;o many of them as have e&s;tates to compound for, to have the Major Generals Letter of recommendation to Parlia|ment, or Committee of Gold&s;miths-hall, for their moderate and ea&s;ie compo&s;itions; they engaging by particular &s;ub&s;criptions before their departure, never to act, Councell or abet any thing prejudiciall, to the Parliament or State of England. The articles &s;igned, and &s;ealed, and ho&s;tages given; the endeavour of our Souldiery was to look nar<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters">owly to the e&s;cape of the Governour, and the five other excepted per&s;ons (they having notice that they intended to make a &s;peedy and
<PB REF="4">bold attempt for that purpo&s;e) on Thur&s;day about the dusk of the evening, the&s;e &s;ix de&s;perite (but to give the Devils their due) yet gallant enemies, make a &s;alley three on the one &s;ide of the Ca&s;tle and three one the other, the Governour, and the two other with him (be|ing gallantly mounted) leap our workes, charge our guards, and enter them in defiance of all oppo&s;ition, and force through, with many wounds given to them, and e&s;pecially their hor&s;es having no &s;ooner pa&s;t through this extream hot &s;ervice, they were forced to engage with a &s;trong party of our forces, that were comming to relief the guards, and though them&s;elves and their nor&s;es were &s;o exceedingly wounded before they armed their &s;elves, with their fir&s;t re&s;olu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">ion, and with a mo&s;t de&s;perate charge forced through, though much wounded again by this party. No &s;ooner had they cleared them&s;elves of this &s;econd engagement, but a party of our hor&s;e pur&s;ue them, and having no way to avoid the&s;e foot who took our hor&s;e to be another part of the enemies, fired upon them, and before they could make them&s;elves known to be friends, the Go|vernour, and the other two were quite e&s;caped, but pur&s;uing them about a mile by blood, found two of their hor&s;es mortally wounded, and the riders for&s;a|ken them, and e&s;caped with the Governor none of them being i&s;nce heard of. The three that &s;allied out on the other &s;ide were repul&s;t, and that night hid them|&s;elves in a private vault in the Ca&s;tle, hoping to work them&s;elves out before, they be di&s;covered. Wedn&s;day morning the Ca&s;tle was &s;urrendred and the Articles exactly performed, they found forty barrels of pow|der, fi&s;h and fle&s;h in abundance, with much corne, which might have pre&s;erved the&s;e three hundred ene|mies three moneths longer, if the private &s;ouldiery would have &s;tood it out.</P>
