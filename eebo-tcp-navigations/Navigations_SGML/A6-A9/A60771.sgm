<HEAD>Some <HI>Con&s;iderations</HI> Humbly Offered, again&s;t Granting the Sole Trade to <HI>GUINY</HI> from Cape <HI>Blanc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI> to Cape <HI>Lopez,</HI> to a Company with a Joint Stock, exclu&s;ive of others.</HEAD>
<P>A Company with a Joint Stock Exclu&s;ive, is a Monopoly; which has al|ways been e&s;teemed a great Grievance in matters of &s;mall Moment, and will be much more &s;o in a Trade of &s;o large Extent, and &s;uch va&s;t Importance to this Nation, in the Export of its Woollen, and other Manufactures; and to the Plantations, in furni&s;hing them with Negroes, by who&s;e Strength and Labour all their Commodities which come from thence, as Sugar, Indigo, Cot|ton, Ginger, Tobacco, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> are produced, and whereby the Navigation and Re|venue of this Kingdom is &s;o greatly Increa&s;ed.</P>
<P>And &s;uch a Company &s;o e&s;tabli&s;hed will have all the Mi&s;chiefs of a Monopoly.</P>
<P N="1">I. They will buy the Woollen, and other Engli&s;h Manufactures, proper for <HI>Guiny,</HI> at their own Rates, having no Competitors, and will &s;ell all the Commo|dities they import from thence into <HI>England,</HI> at what Pri&s;es they plea&s;e.</P>
<P N="2">II. In &s;uch C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;e they alone can carry &s;uch Negroes to the <HI>We&s;t-Indies</HI> as are fit for the Engli&s;h Plantations, which are only to be purcha&s;ed between Cape <HI>Blanco</HI> and Cape <HI>Lopez,</HI> and &s;o will make their own Prizes for them, and impo&s;e what Terms they plea&s;e on the Planters, as heretofore the <HI>African</HI> Company have done: and by buying Negroes dear, le&s;s of the <HI>We&s;t-India</HI> Commodities have been, and will be produced, and at greater Charge; whereby other Nations have already had an Opportunity, and have too well made u&s;e of it, to Vye with us in tho&s;e Commodities; to the great Abatement of the Advantage of this Kingdom; and it may prove the Ruine of our Colonies: For if the Company have produced &s;uch Mi&s;chiefs by the Authority of a Charter only, What may be expected from them, if they &s;hould be e&s;tabli&s;hed by a Law?</P>
<P N="3">III. Such a Company having no Competitors, will buy as Cheap, and &s;ell as Dear as they plea&s;e; and &s;o will get as much by One Thou&s;and Pounds, as would be good Profit to Private Per&s;ons trading with Three times as much; and there|fore it is not their Intere&s;t to enlarge the Trade, but to get as much as they can by the &s;mall Stock they employ; whereas many Buyers would Enhance the Price of Engli&s;h Manufactures at home, and occa&s;ion a great Exportation of them, and lower the Price of Forreign Goods in <HI>England,</HI> and bring Negroes much cheaper to the Plantations, and thereby the Trade would greatly Increa&s;e.</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<HEAD TYPE="sub"><HI>And though the Company now offer to content them&s;elves to be limited from Cape </HI>Blanco<HI> to Cape </HI>Lopez,<HI> and to leave out </HI>Angola,<HI> yet that does not at all help the matter, for the&s;e Rea&s;ons:</HI></HEAD>
<P N="1">1. It is humbly conceived, That all the Subjects of <HI>England</HI> have an Equal Right to all parts of the <HI>Guiny</HI> Trade.</P>
<P N="2">2. The Extent of the Coa&s;t between Cape <HI>Blanco</HI> and Cape <HI>Lopez,</HI> is about 3000 Miles, be&s;ides up the Rivers in the Inland Country; and includes the whole Trade for Gold, Teeth, Dying Wood, and for &s;uch Negroes as are fit for, and de|&s;ired at the Engli&s;h Plantations: For although there are Negroes to be had at <HI>An|gola,</HI> and &s;uch as the <HI>Spaniards</HI> like, yet the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> will not buy them, unle&s;s a few for their Hou&s;e Service; they being a lazy &s;ort of Negro, and very rebellious: And the &s;afety of the Plantations depends upon having Negroes from all parts of <HI>Guiny,</HI> who not under&s;tanding each others languages and Cu&s;toms, do not, and can|not agree to Rebel, as they would do, and has by &s;ad Experience been found, when there are too many Negroes from one Country.</P>
<PB N="2" REF="2" MS="y">
<P N="3">3. This would exclude all the re&s;t of the Subjects of <HI>England</HI> from buying the Manufactures of this Kingdom proper for the <HI>Guiny</HI> Trade, very little of the <HI>Eng|li&s;h</HI> Commodities being vended in <HI>Angola.</HI> For when a Ship is &s;ent thithe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">, in a whole Cargo there is not above 2 <HI>P^<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI> Bayes 1 <HI>C^t</HI> weight of Pewter, 1 piece of Cloath, a few Mu&s;quets, &s;ome Anaba&s;&s;es, and about 5 <HI>l.</HI> value in Knives; all the re&s;t of the Cargo are either Commodities from the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indies,</HI> or Goods from <HI>Holland:</HI> Whereas in a Cargo for tho&s;e parts, from which the Company would have the re&s;t of their Fellow-Subjects excluded, there is &s;ent from 1500 to 2000 pieces of Perpetuanoes, 150, or 200 peices of Sayes, 6 or 700 Dozen of Knives, be&s;ides great quantities of Gunpowder, Boy&s;adoes, Wel&s;h Plains, and Pewter.</P>
<P>And if it &s;hould be pretended, That the Company will furni&s;h the Plantations with what quantity of Negroes they de&s;ire, and at &s;uch Rates as &s;hall be thought Rea|&s;onable by the Parliament, or any other Per&s;ons to be appointed from time to time, yet that would be no more than what they formerly engaged to do, when their Pa|tent was granted by King <HI>Charles</HI> the Second, and in a more e&s;pecial manner for the I&s;land of <HI>Jamaica:</HI> But it's to be Ob&s;erved, That whatever fair and &s;pecious Pretences they made, they were far from performing them; and neither &s;upplied the Plantations with the quantities of Negroes, nor at the prices they were obliged to do; nor <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">ould they hereafter comply any better with &s;uch an Agreement, if it &s;hould be made, for they know in ca&s;e of their Nonperformance, the Planter would be no more able to Contend with their Joynt Stock now, then formerly, and the Governours of the Plantations, being the Companys Factors, the poor Planters mu&s;t be content with their Treatment, whatever it be, becau&s;e the Remedy to ob|tain Redre&s;s, would be wor&s;e then the Injury they &s;uffer.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<HEAD><HI>As to the </HI>Forts<HI> and </HI>Ca&s;tles<HI> whereby they pretend to have Recovered the Trade, and to have &s;ecured it to tho&s;e they call </HI>Interlopers.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. The Trade to <HI>Guinea</HI> was greate&s;t, when it was open, more Goods of the Growth and Manufacture of <HI>England</HI> were Exported for <HI>Guinea,</HI> and the Planta|tions Better and Cheaper furni&s;hed with Negroes, than &s;ince the Company have been &s;etled.</P>
<P N="2">2. At all the Chief Places of Trade for Negroes, there is neither Fort nor Ca&s;tle.</P>
<P N="3">3. Where there is any Fort or Ca&s;tle, they cannot &s;ecure the Trade, or annoy any one that would di&s;turb it, out of the reach of their Guns.</P>
<P N="4">4. One or two Men of War would be a much better Security to the Trade than all their Forts and Ca&s;tles.</P>
<P N="5">5. Although the chiefe&s;t Ca&s;tle the Company have, belongs of right to the Na|tion, and not to the Company, being taken by Engli&s;h Men of War, with the lo&s;s of the Blood of tho&s;e that did not belong to the Company; yet that, and all others, were they more con&s;iderable might be paid for, and with ea&s;e Maintained by a Regulated Company, with a &s;mall Impo&s;ition on the Trade out of <HI>England,</HI> and on the Negroes Imported into the Plantations.</P>
<P>And that there may no room be left to doubt hereof, there are per&s;ons who will engage to Rai&s;e a &s;ufficient Fund to pay for their Forts, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and to defray the fu|ture Charge of Maintaining them, and will receive their Reimbur&s;ement out of the Duties which may be appointed to be Rai&s;ed on the Trade, as it &s;hall come in. And therefore it is humbly hoped, the <HI>Guinea</HI> Trade will be &s;etled in that manner; and the rather, con&s;idering the great Di&s;couragement tho&s;e Merchants and Plan|ters have lain under by the Mortality in the <HI>We&s;t Indies,</HI> and the Earthquake at <HI>Ja|maica,</HI> and the great Lo&s;&s;es which they have &s;u&s;tained in this War; and by the &s;etling the <HI>Guinea</HI> Trade in a Regulated Company, Ingenuity and Indu&s;try would be Encouraged, that Trade would be Secured and Enlarged, more Gold and Goods from <HI>Guinea</HI> would be Imported into <HI>England,</HI> the Plantations would be better and cheaper &s;upplyed with Negroes, whereby the Revenues of the Crown, and the Na|vigation of this Kingdom would be greatly increa&s;ed, and all the Inconveniencies and Mi&s;chiefs of a Monopoly would be avoided.</P>
<P><HI>All which is Humbly Submitted to the Con&s;ideration of the Honourable Hou&s;e of Commons.</HI></P>
