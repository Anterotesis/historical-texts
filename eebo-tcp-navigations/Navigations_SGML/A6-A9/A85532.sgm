<P>THe Earth and Sea, compo&s;ed them&s;elves in a Sphericall figure, and is cau&s;ed by the proper inclination of each part, which being heavy falls from every point of the circum|ference, and claps about the center, there &s;ettlers as neer as it may towards his place of re&s;t: we may ilu&s;trate both the fi|gure and &s;cituation by a familiar &s;imilitude to an ingenious apprehen&s;ion; Suppo&s;e we a knot to be knit in the mid&s;t of a Cord that hath many ends, and tho&s;e to be delivered to &s;un|dry men of equall &s;trength to be drawne &s;everall ways round from every part above, and below, and on each &s;ide.</P>
<P>Que&s;tionle&s;&s;e while every man draws in the boes of the knots, it mu&s;t needs become round, and whil&s;t they continue to pluck with equall &s;trength it mu&s;t re&s;t immoveable in the middle betwixt them, &s;ince every &s;trength that would de&s;troy, hath a &s;trength equall to re&s;i&s;t it; &s;o it is in the bo&s;ome of the earth, where every part wheels upon equall priviledge of na|ture, nor can any pre&s;&s;e farther then the center to de&s;troy this compacted figure, for it mu&s;t meet there with a body that will oppo&s;e it, or if not, yet could it not pa&s;&s;e, &s;ince every motion from the middle were to a&s;cend, which nature will not per|mit in a body of weight as the whole earth is.</P>
<P>The compa&s;&s;e of the whole is ca&s;t by our late&s;t and mo&s;t learned, to be 21600 Engli&s;h miles, which though none ever yet &s;o pared as to mea&s;ure them by the foot, yet let not the ig|norant reject this accompt, &s;ince the rule by which they are led cannot faile: for we &s;ee by continuall experience, that the Sun for every degree in the heavens, gains &s;ixty miles upon the earth, towards his Circuit round, and after three hundred &s;ixty degrees, returneth to the &s;ame point in re&s;pect of us as before it was: repeat the number of 60 &s;o oft and you will finde the accompt ju&s;t, and &s;o by proportion of the circum|ference to the diamiter, which is <HI>tripla &s;e&s;qui-&s;eptima,</HI> the &s;ame which 22 hath hath to 7.

<HEAD>What a Globe is.</HEAD>
<P>A Globe we define to be an Analogicall repre&s;entation ei|ther of the heavens or of the earth, and we call it Anago|licall, not onely in regard of its forme, expre&s;&s;ing the figure of the heavens, as al&s;o of the terre&s;triall Globe, con&s;i&s;ting of the earth it &s;elfe, together with the interflowing &s;eas, but ra|ther, becau&s;e that it repre&s;enteth unto us in a ju&s;t proportion and di&s;tance each particular con&s;tellation in the Heavens, and every &s;everall region and tract of ground in the earth, together with certain circles, both greater and le&s;&s;er, invented by artificers for the more ready computation of the &s;ame.</P>
<P>The greater circles we call tho&s;e which divide the whole &s;uperficies of the Globe into equall parts or halfs and tho&s;e the le&s;&s;er which divide the &s;ame into two unequall parts.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the body of the Globe it &s;elfe, there is al&s;o an|nexed a certaine frame, with nece&s;&s;ary in&s;truments thereto belonging.</P>
<P>The Fabrick of the frame is thus; fir&s;t of all there is a ba&s;e or foot to re&s;t upon, on which, there are rai&s;ed perpendicular|ly &s;ix pillars or columnes of equall length and di&s;tance, upon the top of which there is fa&s;tned to a levell a round plate orcircle of wood, which they call the Horizon, becau&s;e that the uppermo&s;t &s;uperficies thereof performs the office of the true Horizon, for it divideth the whole Globe into 2 equal parts whereof that which was uppermo&s;t, repre&s;enteth unto us the vi&s;ible Hemi&s;phere, and the other, that which is hid from us. So likewi&s;e the circle which divideth that part of the world
<PB N="5" REF="5">which we &s;ee from the other, which we &s;ee not is called the Horizon, and that point which is directly over our heads in our Hemi&s;phere, and is on every &s;ide equadi&s;tant from the Horizon, is commonly called Zenith, and that point which is oppo&s;ite to it in the lower Hemi&s;phere, is commonly written Nadir the&s;e two points are called al&s;o the Poles of the Hori|zon.</P>
<P>Furthermore, upon the &s;uperficies of the Horizon in a mate|riall Globe, there are de&s;cribed fir&s;t, the twelve &s;ignes of the Zodiack, and each of the&s;e is divided againe into thirty le&s;&s;er portions, &s;o that the whole horizon is divided into 360 parts, which they al&s;o call degrees, and every degree is divided into &s;ixty parts, al&s;o each of them is called a &s;cruple or minute, and &s;o by the like &s;ubdivi&s;ion of minutes into &s;ixty parts will a|ri&s;e &s;econds, and of the&s;e thirds, and likewi&s;e fourths, and fifths, &amp;c. but the like partition &s;till of each into &s;ixty parts.</P>
<P>There is al&s;o de&s;cribed upon the Horizon, the Roman Ca|lender, and that three &s;everall ways, to wit, the ancient way, which is &s;till in u&s;e with us here in England, and the new way appointed by Pope Gregory 23, wherein the Aequinoxes and Sol&s;tice were re&s;tored to the &s;ame places they were in at the time of the Celebration of the coun&s;ell of <HI>Nice,</HI> and in the third, the &s;aid Aequinoctiall and Sol&s;ticall points are re&s;tored to the places they were in, at the time of our Saviour Chri&s;ts nativity.</P>
<P>The months in the Calender, are divided into dayes and weeks, to which are annexed as their peculiar characters the 7 fir&s;t letters of the Alphabet</P>
<P>The innermo&s;t border of the Horizon, is divided into thirty two parts, according to the number of the winds, which are ob&s;erved by our moderne Sea-faring-men in their Navigati|ons, by which al&s;o they are wont to de&s;igne forth the quarters of the Heavens, and the Coa&s;ts of Countries, the names of the windes are &s;et downe both in Engli&s;h and Latine, in the Horizon of the materiall Globes.</P>
<P>The u&s;e of the Horizon is manifold, Fir&s;t it divides the heavens into 2 Hemi&s;phears; Secondly it &s;hews what &s;tars ne|ver &s;et, and what never ri&s;e from under the earth, and &s;o like|wi&s;e what &s;tars doe both ri&s;e and &s;et; Thirdly, it &s;heweth the
<PB N="6" REF="6">cau&s;e of the equality and inequality of the arti&s;iciall days and nights; Fourthly, it conduceth to the finding out of the la|titude of any place; Fifthly, it is the cau&s;e of the rectitude and obliquity of the Sphear, whereof we have occa&s;ion to &s;peake more largely hereafter.</P>
<P>There is al&s;o let into this Horizon two notches, oppo&s;ite one to the other, a circle of bra&s;&s;e, making right angles with the &s;aid Horizon, and placed &s;o that it may be removed at plea&s;ure up and down by tho&s;e notches, as need &s;hall require; This Circle is called the Meridian becau&s;e that one &s;ide of it which is in like manner divided into 360 degrees, &s;upplyeth the office of the true Meridian. Now the Meridian is one of greater circles, pa&s;&s;ing through the Poles of the world, and al|&s;o of the Horizon, to which when the Sun in his daily revolu|tion is arrived in the upper Hemi&s;phere it is mid-day, and when it toucheth the &s;ame in the lower Hemi&s;phear it is mid|night at the place who&s;e Meridian it is.</P>
<P>The Meridian (which comes fir&s;t to be con&s;idered) is a great Circle compa&s;&s;ing round the Earth from Pole to Pole; and is that which you &s;ee in the circumference of both Plani&s;phears of the Map, and wherein are written the names of the Zones and Climates, This chief, fir&s;t, fixed Meridian pa&s;&s;eth through the I&s;lands called Azores, according to the ancient Co&s;mo|graphers; and there are two rea&s;ons why they did there be|gin to reckon the longitude of the Earth.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, for that at that time there was no land known further to the We&s;terne then that place.</P>
<P>Secondly, Under that Meridian the Needle in the Marri|ners compa&s;&s;e had no variation, but did point directly North and South.</P>
<P>There be al&s;o many Meridians according to the divers places in which a man lives, the number of them equall to &s;o many points as may be imagined in the Globe; but the u&s;uall &s;et|ting them known to view, is by ten degrees a&s;under; and are tho&s;e black lines which you &s;ee in both Plani&s;phears, running downe along from the North to the South Pole.</P>
<P>The u&s;e of the Meridian, is to &s;hew the longitude of any place. Now the longitude of a Region, City or Cape, is the di&s;tance of it Ea&s;t from the fir&s;t great Meridian; and this lon|gitude
<PB N="7" REF="6">is mea&s;ured and numbred in the Aequinoctiall line by Meridians from the generall and fixed Meridian into the Ea&s;t, and containeth the whole compa&s;&s;e of the Earth, <HI>viz.</HI> 360. degrees.</P>
<P>To prove this by example, ca&s;t your eye on <HI>London,</HI> and you &s;hall &s;ee it &s;omething to the Ea&s;t of the &s;econd black Meridi|an; pa&s;&s;e downe with that black line to the Aequinoctiall, and look as much Ea&s;t there, as <HI>London</HI> is from that Meridian above, then count the degrees of the Aequinoctiall, from the fir&s;t great Meridian to that place, and that di&s;tance is the lon|gitude of <HI>London,</HI> which you may perceive to be 20 degrees and better: And the like manner of working is to be made for all other places.</P>
<P>That line full of degrees cro&s;&s;ing both Plani&s;phears &s;traight along in the middle, and dividing the world into two halfs <HI>(viz.)</HI> North and South halfs; is called the <HI>Aequinoctiall line,</HI> or the Aequator; either becau&s;e it is of equall di&s;tance from both Poles of the world, or el&s;e becau&s;e the Sunne comming in this Circle makes the dayes and nights throughout the world of a length; which happens upon the 10. or 11. of March, and the 13, or 14. of September. It pa&s;&s;es through <HI>Aba&s;&s;ia</HI> or <HI>Pre&s;ter Johns</HI> Kingdome, and Manicongo in Africa, through the great I&s;land Sumatra, and the Maldive I&s;les of A|&s;ia; and in America, through Guiana.</P>
<P>The u&s;e of it is to &s;hew the latitude of any Countrey, Ci|ty, Promontory, or the like: Now the &s;atitude is the di&s;tance of a place toward the South or North, from the Aequinocti|all line or middle of the world; and is reckoned and mea|&s;ured upon the Meridian toward either Pole. Tho&s;e there|fore have Northerne latitude that inhabit between the Equi|noctiall and the North Pole, as they have Southerne latitude that are between the &s;ame Equator and the South Pole.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e black lines thwarting the black Meridians from Ea&s;t to We&s;t, are parallels, and are al&s;o called Aequidi&s;tants, being di&s;tant one from another 10 degrees toward both Poles; and are here &s;et downe for the ea&s;ie counting the latitude of any place from the Aequinoctiall: as for the latitude of <HI>London;</HI> count &s;o many decimall Parallels, till you come to the Pa|rellel which is neare&s;t <HI>London,</HI> (you &s;hall finde them to be five) then follow that line to the Meridian, and &s;ee the figures &s;et
<PB N="8" REF="7">thereat; they are 50.) moreover, adde to that number of 50. &s;o much as London is &s;ituate above that paralel, the &s;pace is one degree and a halfe; thus you &s;hall finde the latitude of <HI>London</HI> (that is, the di&s;tance thereof from the Aequator to|ward the North Pole) to be 51 degrees and a halfe: and in like manner mu&s;t the latitude of all other places be &s;ought. Thus much of Longitude and Latitude, by which two, the whole Earth is reckoned.</P>
<P>The Meridian and Aequinoctiall, as al&s;o the Zodiack, are filled throughout with degrees, the number 360 and every degree con&s;i&s;ts of 60 minutes, and containes, according to our ordinary account, 20. leagues, or 60 miles.</P>
<P>The great circle that is drawn bending bias in one plani&s;|phear up to the Tropick of Cancer, in the other down to the Tropick of Capricorne, is the the Zodiack; it is repleni&s;hed with degrees, and beares on it the Characters of the twelve &s;ignes.</P>
<P>The u&s;es of it are to &s;hew over what Countreys and people the body and beams of the Sun come perpendicular at &s;ome times or other in the year, and it &s;hews to all (where the days increa&s;e and decrea&s;e) the longe&s;t and &s;horte&s;t days of the year, for the Sun (which cau&s;eth the &s;ame) being alwayes in this circle, and therein moving about one degree a day, all the while he is coming up from the Tropick of Capricorne to that of Cancer, the dayes increa&s;e in the Northerne Climates; but contrariwi&s;e in his cour&s;e back from Cancer to Capri|corne they &s;horten to us, and lengthen to tho&s;e in the South|erne Climates; and this Circles &s;hews the four quarter of the yeare; Spring, Summer, Autumne, Winter.</P>
<P>The Tropick of Cancer, (&s;o called, or the Caele&s;tiall &s;igne Cancer) is a circle, who&s;e di&s;tance from the Equinoctiall to|ward the North, is 23 degrees and a half. When the Sun is come &s;o far Northward as to touch this Circle, then is our longe&s;t day in the year.</P>
<P>It pa&s;&s;es through the Southermo&s;t parts of Barbary and Aegypt, Arabia, India, China, <HI>Nova Hi&s;pania,</HI> and the I&s;land Cuba.</P>
<P>The Tropick of Capricorne, (likewi&s;e &s;o named of the &s;ign Capricorne in the &s;tarry heaven) is a circle of like di&s;tance at
<PB N="9" REF="7">the other Tropick from the Aequinoctial Southward, that is 23 degrees and a halfe. When the Sun is gone downe to the Circle Southward, it is our &s;horte&s;t day in the whole year.</P>
<P>This Tropick pa&s;&s;es throngh Monomopata, Saint Laurence I&s;land, Peru, and South coa&s;ts of Bra&s;ile.</P>
<P>The Artick, or North polar Circle, is di&s;tant from the North Pole, 23 degrees and a halfe; &s;o much as the Tropick of Cancer from the Aequinoctiall; but the di&s;tance between that Tropick and it, is 43 degrees.</P>
<P>You may &s;ee it pa&s;&s;e through I&s;land, Norway, Boddia, Mo&s;covy, Tartary, cro&s;&s;e <HI>Davis</HI> Straits, and Greenland.</P>
<P>The Antartike or South polar Circle, is di&s;tant from the South Pole, 23. degrees and a halfe; &s;o far as the Tropick of Capricorne is from the Equinoctiall.</P>
<P>The Circle pa&s;&s;es through Magellanica, or <HI>Terra Au&s;tralis Incognita</HI> onely.</P>
<P>Now the&s;e four le&s;&s;er circles, <HI>(viz.)</HI> the two Tropicks, and Polar Circles, doe fitly part the Earth into five Zones.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>The Zones.</HEAD>
<P>A <HI>Zone</HI> is a &s;pace of Earth, contained between two of the &s;maller circles, or within the compa&s;&s;e of either Polar Circle: the name &s;ignifies as much as a girdle, by rea&s;on that each Zone compa&s;&s;eth about the Earth in manner of a gir|dle. Of the&s;e there be two kinds, one temperate, the other untemperate.</P>
<P>There be two temperate Zones; the one North, the other South.</P>
<P>The North temperate Zone is that &s;pace of earth contai|ned between the Tropick of Cancer, and the North Polar Circle.</P>
<P>The South temperate Zone is that &s;pace of earth &s;tretched along between the Tropick of Capricorne, and the South Polar Circle.</P>
<PB N="10" REF="8">
<P>They are called temperate Zones, for that the aire thereof hath a farre better and more moderate temperature, and meeter for man to inhabit, then the untemperate Zones. The breadth of them is forty three degrees a piece, which de|grees make either temperate Zone to be 2580 Engli&s;h miles broad a piece.</P>
<P>The untemperate Zones are twofold; one exceeding in the extremity of heat, the other as much in cold; they have been thought in former times altogether unhabitable, but latter experience hath found them more fit for habitation.</P>
<P>The Torrid or burnt Zone (which is the hot untempe|rate Zone) is that &s;pace of heaven which you &s;ee contained between the Tropick of Cancer, and that of Capricorne. It hath the name of Torrid, becau&s;e the Sun continually pa&s;&s;es thereover, and ca&s;ting downe direct rayes, affects it with a marvellous heat; thereby making it not &s;o inconvenient for the Inhabitants, as the temperate Zones are.

<P>IN that great meridian going about Europe, A&s;ia, and Afri|ca, are de&s;cribed the Climates; Now a Climate is a &s;pace of the Earth included within the &s;pace of two Parellels. The u&s;e of them is to &s;hew the difference of length and &s;hortne&s;&s;e of dayes over all the world, as you may &s;ee in the mid&s;t of e|very climate, &s;et the number of the houres of the longe&s;t day in the year, under that Climate: the longe&s;t day in one Cli|mate, differing halfe an hour from the longe&s;t in another. &s;o that there are four and twenty Climates, con&s;i&s;ting of forty eight Parallels, ere the day come to be twenty foure hours in length, which is twelve houres longer then the or|dinary Aequinoctiall day is. Now this is to be under&s;tood; Under the Aequinoctiall line, and thirteen degrees, that is, three Parallels, on either &s;ide thereof, the dayes exceed not the length of twelve hours, but after in every Clime increa&s;e the length of halfe an houre, &s;o that there are numbred (as is &s;aid before) 48 Parallels, which make twenty four Climates, before the dayes become twenty foure houres long; the which length they being grown to, their increa&s;e is then by whole weeks and months, till in the four &amp; twentieth Clime: about the Pole, the day is full halfe a year long. And it is thus between the equator and the North Pole, &s;o it is between the &s;aid Aequator and South Pole: wherfore there are 2 &s;orts of Climes, that is 24 Northerne, and as many Southerne.

<P>THe fir&s;t whereof is concerning the po&s;ition of the Globe, and the other Climates. Now touching the po&s;ition of the Globe, you are fir&s;t of all to take care that it be placed per|pendicularly to the true horizon; Secondly, That the di&s;tin|ction of the winds an&s;wer directly to the windes of the reall Horizon, that &s;o the Ea&s;t on your materiall Globe may look directly towards the true Ea&s;t of the world; for which pur|po&s;e e&s;pecially there is u&s;ually placed a Nauticall compa&s;&s;e in the bottom of the frame. When you have thus placed your Globe &s;o that it may be turned any way at plea&s;ure, yet &s;o that the ba&s;e or foot be not moved out of its place. The next thing that is to be inquired after, is the latitude of the place wherein you live, which according as it is greater or le&s;&s;e, you mu&s;t elevate the Pole of your Globe above the horizon pro|portionably. As for example, if the latitude be 50, 51, or 52. grad. or more or le&s;&s;e Northward, then mu&s;t you elevate the Artick pole, ju&s;t &s;o many degrees above the Horizon, and &s;o likewi&s;e if the latitude be Southerne, you mu&s;t doe the like by the Antartick or South Pole, But under the Aequator where there is no latitude at all both the Poles mu&s;t be placed in the very Horizon at oppo&s;ite points.</P>
<P>Now if you de&s;ire to know the longitude of any place ex|pre&s;&s;ed in the Globe, you mu&s;t apply the &s;ame place to the Meridian, and ob&s;erving at what place the Meridian cutteth the Aequator, reckon the degree of the Aequator from the Me|ridian of St. <HI>Michaels</HI> I&s;land to that place; for &s;o many are the degrees of longitude of the place you look for.</P>
<P>In the &s;ame manner you may mea&s;ure the difference of lon|gitude betwixt any other two places that are de&s;cribed in the Globes.</P>
<P>Now if you de&s;ire to finde the latitude of any place expre&s;|&s;ed in the Globe, you mu&s;t apply the &s;ame to the Meridian, and reckon the number of the degrees that it is di&s;tant from the Aequator, for &s;o much is the latitude of that place.</P>
<P>To finde the di&s;tance of two places, &s;et your Globe in &s;uch &s;ort, as that the Zenith of one of the plates be 90 degrees di|&s;tant
<PB N="16" REF="11">every way from the Horizon, and then fa&s;ten the Qua|drant of altitude to the verticall point and &s;o move it up and downe untill it pa&s;&s;e through the vertix of the other place, the number of the degrees intercepted in the Quadrant be|twixt the two places, being re&s;olved into furlongs, miles or leagues, as you plea&s;e will &s;hew you the true di&s;tance of the places a&s;&s;igned, and the other end of the Quadrant that touch|eth upon the Horizon will &s;how on what winde or quarter of the world the one place is in re&s;pect of the other, or what an|gle or po&s;ition it hath for the angle or po&s;ition is that which is comprehended betwixt the Meridian of any place, and a great Circle pa&s;&s;ing through the Zeniths of any two places a&s;&s;igned, and the quantity of it is to be numbred in the Ho|rizon.</P>
<P>As for example, The longitude of London is 26 degrees and it hath in Northerne latitude 51 degrees and a halfe. Now it is demanded, what di&s;tance and angle of po&s;ition it beareth to Saint <HI>Michaels</HI> I&s;land, which is one of the Azore we mu&s;t proceed thus to finde it; fir&s;t, let the North Pole be Elevated 51&frac12; degrees which is the latitude of London, then fa&s;tning the quadrant of altitude to the Zenith of it, that is to &s;ay 51 degrees and an halfe Northward from the Aequtor; we mu&s;t turne it about till it pa&s;&s;e through Saint Michaels I&s;land, and wee &s;hall finde the di&s;tance intercepted betwixt the&s;e 2 places to be 11 degree, 40. m. or thereabouts, which is 280. of our leagues, and if we ob&s;erve in what part of the horizon the end of the quadrant re&s;teth we &s;hall finde the angle of po&s;ition to fall neer upon 50 gr. betwixt South-we&s;t &amp; by we&s;t, and this is the Scituation of this I&s;land in re&s;pect of London. The di&s;tance of place differing onely in latitude may be found out after this manner; Fir&s;t, you mu&s;t &s;ub&s;tract the le&s;&s;er latitude from the greater, re&s;olving a degree into minutes, if the &s;ub&s;tracti|on cannot be done otherwi&s;e conveniently, then multiply the degrees by 15, and divide the minutes by 4. and the &s;um produce will be the di&s;tance of tho&s;e two places in common Germaine miles, one whereof containeth four of our En|gli&s;h miles.</P>

<HEAD>How to make a Sun Dyall by the Globe for any latitude of place.</HEAD>
<P>FOr the making of a plaine Horizontall dyall, having fir&s;t prepared your flat dyall ground parallel to the Horizon, draw a Meridian on it as exactly North and South as po&s;&s;ibly you can, which done, draw another Ea&s;t and We&s;t, which mu&s;t cro&s;&s;e it at right Angels; The fir&s;t of which lines will &s;hew 12, and the other 6 of the Clock both morning and evening. Then making a Center in the interfection of the&s;e two lines, de&s;cribe a Circle on your dyall to what di|&s;tance you plea&s;e, and then divide it as all othr Circles u&s;u|ally
<PB N="25" REF="15">are into 360 parts and it will not be ami&s;&s;e to &s;ub-devide each of the&s;e into le&s;&s;er parts if it may be conveniently done. And now it only remaines to finde out the di&s;tances of the houre lines in this Circle, for any latitude of place, which that we may doe by the u&s;e of the Globe, let it fir&s;t be &s;et to the Latitude of the place a&s;&s;igned, and then make choice of &s;ome of the greater Circles in the Globe that pa&s;&s;e through the Poles of the world. As for example, The Aequinoctiall colour if you plea&s;e, and apply the &s;ame to the Meridian, in which &s;cituation it &s;heweth the mid-day, or 12 a Clock, then turning about the Globe toward the We&s;t (if you will) till that 15 degrees of the Aequator have pa&s;&s;ed through the Me|ridian: you mu&s;t marke the degree of the Horizon, that the &s;ame colour cro&s;&s;eth in the Horizon, for that point will &s;hew the di&s;tance of the fir&s;t and <HI>11th</HI> houres from the Meridian both of which are di&s;tant an hours &s;pace from the Meridian, or line of Mid-day; then turning againe the Globe forward till other fifteen degrees are pa&s;t the Meridian, the &s;ame colour, will point out the di&s;tance of the <HI>10th</HI> hour, which is 2 hours before noon, and of the &s;econd hour after-noon; and in the &s;ame manner may you finde out the di&s;tances of all the re&s;t in the Horizon, allotting to each of them 15 degrees in the Ae|quator, cro&s;&s;ing the Meridian; but here you mu&s;t take notice by the way, that the beginning of this account of the di&s;tan|ces, mu&s;t be taken from that part of the Horizon on which the Pole is elevated, to wit, from the North-part of the Ho|rizon, if the Artick Pole be elevate, and &s;o likewi&s;e from the South part, if the Antartick be elevated.</P>
<P>The di&s;tances of the hours being thus noted in the Hori|zon of the Globe, you mu&s;t afterward tran&s;late them into your plaine allotted for your dyal ground, reckoning in the circumference of it &s;o many degrees to each houre as are an|&s;werable to tho&s;e pointed out by the colour in the Horizon; and la&s;tly, having thus, done the Gnomon or Stile mu&s;t be e|rected, where you are to ob&s;erve this one thing, which is in|deed the chief thing to be carefully looked unto, namely, that that edge or line of the Gnomon, which is to &s;hew the hours by its &s;hadow in all kinds of dyals mu&s;t be &s;et paralel to the Axis of the world, that &s;o it may make an angle of inclina|tion,
<PB N="26" REF="16">with its plaine ground equall to that which the Axis of the world makes with the Horizon, now that the &s;tile is to &s;tand directly to the North and South, or the Meridian line is a thing commonly knowne.</P>
<P>Now if you would make a plaine erect dyal perpendicular to the Horizon, which is commonly called a <HI>Mural,</HI> and re|&s;pecting either the North or South, you mu&s;t remember this one thing, that that which is an erect dyall in one place will be a Horizontall in another, who&s;e Zenith is di&s;tant from that place 90 degrees either North-ward or South-ward.</P>
<P>And &s;o likewi&s;e by this rule may be made any manner of inclining dyall, if &s;o be that the quantity of the inclination be but knowne, as for example, if a dyall be made on a plain ground, who&s;e inclination is ten degrees from the Horizon Southward, and for a place who&s;e latitude is 52 gr. North-ward, you mu&s;t de&s;cribe it in that plaine and horizontall dial for the Latitude of 62 degrees North-ward, and if in the &s;ame Latitude the diall ground doe incline toward the North 16 gr. you mu&s;t take in horizontall dial for the Northerne lati|tude of 36 gr.</P>
