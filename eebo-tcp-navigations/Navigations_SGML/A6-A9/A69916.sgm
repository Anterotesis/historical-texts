<HEAD>TO THE WORTHY
Samuel Sheppard, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR>
SHERIFF Elect for the
CITY of LONDON
And COUNTY of
MIDDLESEX.</HEAD>
<P>SIR, when I &s;aw &s;o con&s;iderable
a part of the Nation join'd in
the de&s;ign of &s;ettling the <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI>
Trade upon a new Foundation, I
thought I could &s;carce pitch upon a
more &s;ea&s;onable juncture, than this,
to make my Authors appear in <HI>Eng|land,</HI>
to give us an account of their
<PB REF="3">
ten Years Tran&s;actions, among the
&s;ame Nations, where in all probabi|lity
our <HI>Indian</HI> Trade is to be carri|ed
on to the Honour and Advantage
of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Nation. I will not
pretend to enlarge my &s;elf here up|on
the u&s;efulne&s;s of Commerce in
General, or of that of the <HI>Indies</HI> in
Particular; if the &s;tation I am in did
not excu&s;e me from undertaking
that task, the univer&s;al con&s;ent of all
civilized Nations, who look upon
traffick as one of the main Pillars of
the pro&s;perity of the Common-Wealth,
is a demon&s;tration &s;uffici|ent
to over-balance any thing that
can be &s;aid upon &s;o ample a &s;ubject
by a private hand. And as to
what relates to the <HI>Indian</HI> Trade in
particular, our Neighbours the
<PB REF="3">
<HI>Dutch,</HI> who have made it the foun|dation
&s;tone of the pre&s;ent flouri&s;h|ing
State of their Common-wealth,
are living in&s;tances, to convince us
what improvements may be made in
this kind, if managed by a dextrous
hand. I might in this place have
made &s;ome Reflections, perhaps not
altogether u&s;ele&s;s, upon the pre&s;ent
condition of &s;ome of the <HI>Indian</HI>
Countries, e&s;pecially upon tho&s;e on
the Coa&s;t of <HI>Malabar,</HI> who being
divided into &s;o many petty Princi|palities,
and for the mo&s;t part Situ|ated
very convenient for Traffick,
&s;eem to invite us to be &s;harers with
them in the va&s;t advantages the <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI>
Trade affords: But when I
con&s;idered with my &s;elf the extra|ordinary
ability of the Per&s;on, un|to
<PB REF="4">
whom I was making my addre&s;|&s;es,
and on the other hand what
&s;lender &s;hare of experience I had
in the&s;e affairs, I was not without
rea&s;on afraid I &s;hould run my &s;elf
into the &s;ame Error a certain an|cient
<HI>Grecian</HI> Philo&s;opher did, who
being Honoured with a Vi&s;it by that
renown'd <HI>African</HI> Warriour <HI>Han|nibal,</HI>
entertain'd him with a very
long and tedious le&s;&s;on concerning
the duty of a General. I will inge|nuou&s;ly
confe&s;s, it was chiefly upon
the &s;core of your Merits, and the
reputation you have &s;o de&s;ervedly
acquired in the management of an
affair of the utmo&s;t con&s;equence to
the Glory and Advantage of the
<HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Nation, that when the&s;e
<HI>Indian</HI> Travellers after their return
<PB REF="4">
home from a long and mo&s;t dange|rous
Voyage, were to make their
appearance among us; I judg'd I
could not recommend them to the
protection of any other per&s;on, than
your &s;elf, who both for your Abi|lity
and Zeal, have given &s;uch am|ple
demon&s;trations to the World in
what relates to the affairs of the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indies;</HI>
that, as your Judgment, by
the con&s;ent of all &s;ides, is unque&s;ti|onable,
&s;o the&s;e Travellers have all
the rea&s;on imaginable to promi&s;e
them&s;elves due Encouragement from
your generous inclinations. Before I
conclude; I cannot pa&s;s by in &s;ilence,
and apply with &s;ome &s;mall alterations
here, the words Mr. <HI>Rennefort</HI> makes
u&s;e of in re&s;pect of the <HI>French Ea&s;t-India</HI>
Company; that &s;ince our pre|&s;ent
<PB REF="5">
<HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> Company is e&s;tabli&s;h|ed
by the con&s;ent of the repre&s;enta|tives
of the whole Nation, under the
protection of his pre&s;ent Maje&s;ty,
who by his mo&s;t Glorious Actions,
has made him&s;elf both Admired and
Redoubted in far di&s;tant Countries,
we have all the rea&s;on to hope, that
under the Direction of &s;uch Per&s;ons,
who have an equal &s;hare of Experi|ence,
Conduct and Honour, they
may in time, at lea&s;t equalize, if not
out-vie the re&s;t of the <HI>European</HI> Na|tions
that have e&s;tabli&s;hed them&s;elves
in the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indies.</HI> Which is the

<PB REF="5">
<HEAD>THE
PREEACE
TO THE
READER.</HEAD>
<P>THE en&s;uing Treati&s;e, falling by
chance into my hands; after a
full peru&s;al of it, I thought it highly
worth my care of making it appear in
the World under an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Garb, at
a time, when our Nation has a very
near concern in Foreign Affairs, and
its Genius &s;eems more than ever bent
upon the improvement of its Knowledge,
<PB REF="6">
in relation to Foreign Countries. I lay
this down as a general meaning, which
I &s;uppo&s;e few will contradict, that as
tho&s;e who want the conveniency of &s;a|tisfying
their curio&s;ity by travelling a|broad
them&s;elves, (e&s;pecially in far di|stant
Countries) cannot in any way bet|ter
&s;upply this defect, than by applying
them&s;elves to &s;uch Authors, as by a long
experience having had the opportunity of
informing them&s;elves concerning the true
con&s;titution of the&s;e-Countries, are in all
probability, the mo&s;t proper Per&s;ons to an|&s;wer
their end, as having at their own
expence, endeavoured to improve the ge|neral
knowledge of Mankind. It cannot
be denied, but that in our time, there
have appeared more Books of this kind
abroad, than perhaps all the Ages before
us can produce; and that the <HI>French</HI>
in particular have been more liberal
in furni&s;hing us with the Relations of
their Travels, than any other Nation:
But not to deviate from the truth, it
<PB REF="6">
mu&s;t be al&s;o confe&s;s'd, That as to what
relates to their Voyages to the <HI>Indies,</HI>
they are for the mo&s;t part confin'd to the
De&s;cription of &s;ome particular Country or
other, whereas the en&s;uing Treati&s;e gives
a view of a great part of that va&s;t
Country, comprehended under the Name
of the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indies.</HI> It may al&s;o be ob|&s;erved,
that many of our Modern Au|thors,
in their De&s;criptions of the&s;e far
di&s;tant Countries, have affected a way
of &s;urpri&s;ing rather than in&s;tructing their
Readers; they repre&s;ent both the Climate
of the <HI>Indies</HI> and its products, as the
effects of a quite different, if not contra|ry
principle of Nature, from what we
find in our parts, whereas it may be &s;uf|ficiently
evident, to all &s;uch as will con|&s;ider
the whole without prejudice, that
Nature performs its operations in all
parts of the World, according to its pri|mitive
Fundamental Laws, that the
Heats and Colds of the&s;e &s;everal Cli|mates
differ only in degrees, and that
<PB REF="7">
the Mon&s;ters of <HI>Africa</HI> or the <HI>Indies,</HI>
are no more &s;urpri&s;ing to the Inhabitants
of the&s;e parts, than the Bea&s;ts that
are commonly &s;een and bred among us
are to the <HI>Europeans.</HI> Mo&s;t of the&s;e
Authors &s;eem to have been &s;eized with
an itch of plea&s;ing their Readers, and
of creating in them an Opinion of their
own more than ordinary Ability, and
in&s;ight into the Manners and Cu&s;toms of
tho&s;e Nations they have treated of, which
has made them di&s;po&s;e their Treati&s;es
into large Volumes by many Digre&s;&s;ions,
artificial Reflections, and &s;ometimes in|ventions
of their own, &s;uch as they
thought mo&s;t &s;uitable to the genious of
&s;uch as they intended to plea&s;e. I don't
in the lea&s;t que&s;tion, but that tho&s;e who
will peru&s;e the en&s;uing Account, will
&s;oon be convinced, that Mon&s;ieur <HI>Dil|lon</HI>
its Author, (though a Man of a
more than ordinary Capacity and Learning)
has throughout the whole Treati&s;e acted
with more Sincerity than Artifice, and
<PB REF="7">
to make u&s;e of his own Words in his Pre|face.
That, <HI>tho' after a &s;tay of Ten
Years in the</HI> Indies, <HI>he was by an un|fore&s;een
Accident obliged to return
to</HI> France <HI>much &s;ooner than he ex|pected,
whereby he was prevented
of making &s;ome particular Ob&s;erva|tions,
which might have been &s;uffi|ciently
diverting to the Reader; and
that therefore, if this Relation might
not be equally plea&s;ing to all who
affect Novelties beyond Truths, and
are taken with Voluminous pieces;
neverthele&s;s, he could a&s;&s;ure them,
that as his intention had been to re|duce
the whole into as &s;mall a com|pa&s;s
as the nature of the thing would
admit of, without entangling him|&s;elf
in the Relation of many &s;trange
Adventures, which he could not but
Judge to be nau&s;eous to per&s;ons of
a &s;olid Judgment, &s;o he had taken
all the imaginable care not to in&s;ert
any thing but what was in all re|&s;pects
<PB REF="8">
con&s;onant to Truth, and
what he had not by hear&s;ay and up|on
the Credit of others, but by his
own Experience, during his &s;tay in
the</HI> Indies. I cannot pa&s;s by in &s;ilence,
that the Appendix concerning the Di&s;tem|pers
of the <HI>Indies,</HI> ought to be look'd up|on
as a &s;ingular piece, if it be con&s;idered
how little that is Authentick there is ex|tant
upon that Subject, and that Mon&s;ieur
<HI>Dellon,</HI> being a Doctor of Phy&s;ick, his
profe&s;&s;ion entitles him to have had a better
in&s;ight into it, than mo&s;t other Travellers
could pretend to. That nothing might be
wanting, which in all probability could
give the better &s;atisfaction to the publick,
I judged it not unadvi&s;able, to add by
way of Supplement, &s;ome matters relating
to the <HI>Indies,</HI> taken out of Mon&s;ieur <HI>de
Rennefort</HI>'s Hi&s;tory of the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indies,</HI>
which having a near affinity to many things
related by Mon&s;ieur <HI>Dellon,</HI> I thought
might much illu&s;trate &s;ome matters, which
que&s;tionle&s;s for brevity's &s;ake he thought
<PB REF="8">
fit to pa&s;s by in &s;ilence; &s;ome others there
are, which not being come to Mon&s;ieur
<HI>Dellon</HI>'s knowledge, (as about Mon|&s;ieur
<HI>de la Hay</HI>'s expedition again&s;t the
I&s;le of St. <HI>Thomas,</HI> and his Tran&s;acti|ons
in the I&s;le of <HI>Madaga&s;car,</HI>) I be|lieved
would be no ungrateful Addition to
render the whole the more compleat; e|&s;pecially
when I made due reflection upon
the Character of Mon&s;ieur <HI>de Rennefort,</HI>
who having been intru&s;ted for a con&s;ide|rable
time with the management of Affairs
in the <HI>Indies,</HI> by the <HI>French Ea&s;t-In|dia</HI>
Company, might claim the &s;ame Au|thority
with Mon&s;ieur <HI>Dellon;</HI> but I will
not enlarge my &s;elf any further upon the
merits of my Author, being &s;ufficiently
convinced that as his la&s;t Chapter, which
contains a project for the improvement of
the <HI>French Ea&s;t-India</HI> Company, &s;hews
him to be a per&s;on of a more than ordinary
Capacity and Experience in the <HI>Indian</HI>
Affairs, &s;o the whole Book will be in all
probability accepted of by the unbia&s;s'd
<PB REF="9">
and judicious Reader, if not, as the mo&s;t
ample and perfect in all its parts, at lea&s;t
as the mo&s;t Sincere and exten&s;ive for its
bulk, as repre&s;enting in a &s;mall compa&s;s
a &s;hort view of many of the mo&s;t con&s;idera|ble
parts of tho&s;e va&s;t Countries, compre|hended

<HEAD>CHAP. I.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Our Departure out of France.</HEAD>
<P>ALL Mankind have a certain Natural pro|pen&s;ity
to Curio&s;ity, but Young people
have commonly a greater Inclination to
&s;atisfie their own Fancies, taken up for the mo&s;t
part with Novelties, than tho&s;e who are arrived
to a ripe Age. For my part having always been
<PB N="2" REF="17">
inflamed with a mo&s;t ardent de&s;ire of Travelling,
after I had fini&s;hed the cour&s;e of my Studies, I
left <HI>Paris</HI> with no other re&s;olution than to leave
<HI>France,</HI> and by the Conver&s;ation with Foreigners
to make my &s;elf acquainted with their Genius
and Manners.</P>
<P>Being informed that the Royal <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> Com|pany
was Equipping &s;ome Ships at <HI>Port-Royal,</HI> I
directed my cour&s;e thither, and entred my &s;elf in|to
their Service; in a Ship of 400 Tuns, cal|led
the <HI>Strong,</HI> Commanded by Captain <HI>Merchand,</HI>
and left that Harbour within 14 days after, in the
Company of the <HI>Golden-Eagle.</HI> But we had &s;carce
been a few Hours under Sail, when a Calm ob|liged
us to come to an Anchor, near the I&s;le of
<HI>Groy,</HI> about 2 Leagues from the <HI>French</HI> Shoar,
where we remain'd till the next Morning, when
with a fre&s;h Gale of North-Ea&s;t Wind, we &s;oon
lo&s;t &s;ight of our Native Shoar.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t inconveniency I was &s;en&s;ible of in this
Voyage, was, my being Sea-Sick, as well as all
the re&s;t, who were mo&s;t acquainted before with
the Watery Element, but a little time cured us of
that Di&s;temper. For 8 days together we &s;aw no|thing
but the Sea and the Skies, when at la&s;t our
Sentries di&s;covered 4 Sails to the Windward of
us, and we being at that time engaged in a War
with <HI>Spain,</HI> our Captain was getting every thing
ready, in ca&s;e there &s;hould be any occa&s;ion of en|gaging
the Enemy; ordering the <HI>Golden-Eagle,</HI>
who was a nimbler Sailer than we, to endeavour
to come up with them fir&s;t: But having &s;oon
di&s;covered them to be <HI>French</HI> Ships, bound for
<HI>Newfoundland,</HI> we continu'd our Voyage without
any further hinderance; till &s;ome days after, when
a mo&s;t furious Tempe&s;t aro&s;e, which la&s;ted near
18 Hours, put us into no &s;mall di&s;tre&s;s; &s;carce
had we e&s;caped that danger, but we were thrown in|to
another, no le&s;s dangerous than the former&punc;
For our Ship Sprung a Leak, and then fell in &s;uch
a va&s;t quantity of Water, that both our Pumps
<PB N="3" REF="17">
not being &s;ufficient to exhau&s;t it, it was thought
mo&s;t advi&s;able, to make, together with the <HI>Golden-Eagle,</HI>
the be&s;t of our way to the <HI>French</HI> Coa&s;t.
Whil&s;t we were ju&s;t upon the point of putting it
in execution, the Leak was by good Fortune di&s;|covered,
and &s;oon &s;topped, &s;o that we &s;pent the
remainder of the day in making good Cheer for
Joy of having e&s;caped &s;o imminent a danger. The
next Morning by break of day, we came in &s;ight
of a very large Ship, and the <HI>Golden-Eagle</HI> being
advanced within Canon-Shot, gave her the Signal
of Striking; but finding her not to comply imme|diately
with our de&s;ire, we put out the White Flag,
when &s;he in&s;tantly lower'd her Top Sail. This
was a Ship belonging to <HI>Diep,</HI> which was bound
to <HI>Senegal,</HI> where they Trade in Ivory, Feathers
and Gold-Du&s;t; the Captain's Name was <HI>Le Moyne,</HI>
and having thus continued our Voyage together,
we left him near the Mouth of the River <HI>Niger,</HI>
directing our Cour&s;e to <HI>Cape Verd,</HI> where we Ar|rived
in 6 Weeks, after our fir&s;t departure out of
<HI>France.</HI></P>

<HEAD>CHAP. II.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of Cape Verd.</HEAD>
<P>THIS is a part of <HI>Africa,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Cape Verd.</NOTE> Situate at about 14
Degrees North Latitude; it has a pretty
large Bay, but no &s;afe Riding for Ships, as ha|ving
no &s;helter again&s;t the violence of the Winds,
and it is &s;o dangerous Landing, all round the Bay,
that many <HI>Chaloups</HI> have been lo&s;t at their ap|proach
near the Shoar. The <HI>Hollanders</HI> Inhabited
at that time a &s;mall I&s;land,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The I&s;land of <HI>Go<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ea&punc;</HI></NOTE> at a little di&s;tance
from it, which has had almo&s;t as many Ma&s;ters
<PB N="4" REF="18">
as have thought it worth their while to take Po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion
of it; it being of &s;o little Defence, that
the <HI>Dutch</HI> &s;eem only to keep it, becau&s;e no body
Di&s;putes with them about the Propriety of a
place, which being very Barren, is de&s;titute of eve|ry
thing requi&s;ite for the nece&s;&s;ity and conveni|ency
of human Life, except what they are &s;up|ply'd
with from <HI>Cape Verd.</HI></P>
<P>The people Inhabiting <HI>Cape Verd,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Inhabi|tants of</HI> Cape Verd.</NOTE> are of a mo&s;t
dreadful A&s;pect, much beyond what the re&s;t of
the <HI>Africans</HI> are; the Women are as ugly as the
Men; the fir&s;t carry their Children upon their
Backs, and &s;uckle them over their Shoulders. They
are much addicted to hunting, and as la&s;civious as
they are ugly, pro&s;tituting them&s;elves in publick
to Strangers. The <HI>Africans</HI> are for the mo&s;t part
<HI>Mahometans,</HI> but be&s;ides this, they u&s;e many &s;uper|&s;titious
Ceremonies, which have not the lea&s;t Af|finity
with tho&s;e pre&s;crib'd in the Alcoran. They
are generally very obliging to &s;uch Strangers as
chance to Land on their Coa&s;t; but Stealing is
&s;o common a practice with them, that one is ob|liged
to be con&s;tantly upon one's guard. They
Live for the mo&s;t part upon what they catch when
they go a Hunting, and their Bread is made of
Millet, they having no great &s;tore of Rice or
Wheat.</P>
<P>But I will not pretend to enlarge my &s;elf here
upon their manner of living, others having &s;uffi|ciently
acquitted them&s;elves as to this part before
me; and, as I have taken a re&s;olution to deal
with the utmo&s;t &s;incerity in all re&s;pects, &s;o I
will confe&s;s ingeniou&s;ly, that I had not &s;ufficient
opportunity to inform my &s;elf fully concerning all
matters relating to this people, we not &s;taying here
any longer than was ab&s;olutely requi&s;ite, for the
providing us with nece&s;&s;ary refre&s;hments.</P>
<P>For after a &s;tay of 12 days, the Wind being fa|vourable,
we weighed Anchor, and put again to
Sea, but before we lo&s;t &s;ight of the Shoar, we
were becalmed for &s;ome days, during which time,
<PB N="5" REF="18">
we diverted our &s;elves with Fi&s;hing, but e&s;peci|ally
with catching of <HI>Requins,</HI> (which the <HI>Portu|gue&s;es</HI>
call <HI>Tuberos</HI>) of whom we took a con&s;i|derable
number,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Fi&s;h called <HI>Re|quin.</HI></NOTE> only to have the &s;atisfaction of
&s;elling them; they being &s;eldom made u&s;e of, but
in ca&s;e of the greate&s;t extremity, becau&s;e their
Fle&s;h is extreamly hard and &s;carce dige&s;tible.
There are &s;ome of them of that bigne&s;s as to be
able to &s;wallow a Man; the Females bear their
Young ones in their Bellies, without the lea&s;t ap|pearance
of any Spawn; I have found a dozen
Young ones at a time, which being cut out of
the Bellies of the Old ones, were a Foot and half
long, and much better to Eat than the great
ones.</P>
<P>There are al&s;o &s;everal other &s;orts of Fi&s;h catch'd
betwixt the two Tropicks, and among others
tho&s;e call'd by the <HI>Portugue&s;es,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Bonites.</NOTE> <HI>Bonites,</HI> a very de|licious
Fi&s;h, and one of the be&s;t in tho&s;e Seas.
The flying Fi&s;h are to be met with here in great
numbers,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Flying-Fi&s;h.</NOTE> re&s;embling both in &s;hape and bigne&s;s
our Herrings, their Wings being not unlike to
tho&s;e of a Flittermou&s;e. They cannot make u&s;e
of them unle&s;s they be wet, which makes them
continually plunge them&s;elves in the Water. It
is the mo&s;t &s;urprizing thing in the World to &s;ee
them in &s;o prodigious numbers, if it be con&s;i|der'd
that they are &s;urrounded in both the Ele|ments
by their Enemies, who gives them but lit|tle
re&s;t, whereever they meet with them; for the
Birds continually per&s;ecute them in the Air, and
when they &s;eek for refuge in the Water, the
<HI>Bonites,</HI> who have a great antipathy again&s;t them,
devour them; &s;o that whereever they are, they are
never &s;ecure again&s;t their Enemies.</P>
<P>We pa&s;s'd the Equinoctial Line about 3 Weeks
after our departure from <HI>Cape Verd,</HI> and about a
Month after the Tropick of <HI>Capricorn.</HI></P>
<P>Hitherto we had met with no con&s;iderable di&s;|a&s;ter,
during our whole Voyage; but now the
<HI>Golden-Eagle</HI> being de&s;titute of fre&s;h Water, we
<PB N="6" REF="19">
were fain to &s;hare ours with her, and the next
following Night were &s;eparated from one another
by &s;tre&s;s of Weather. But the wor&s;t of all was,
that our Ship &s;prung 3 days after another Leak,
which let in the Water in &s;uch a quantity, as to
make us &s;ufficiently &s;en&s;ible of our imminent dan|ger,
of being inevitably lo&s;t, we being at too great
a di&s;tance from any Shoar, to entertain the lea&s;t
hopes of e&s;caping the danger; but we had once
more the good Fortune to find out the Leak,
and by applying &s;peedy and effectual Remedies
again&s;t the evil, that a few Hours before threat|ned
our de&s;truction, the hopes of Life began to
re&s;ettle our di&s;turbed Spirits, which the fear of
our approaching cruel Fate and the con&s;tant fa|tigues
had almo&s;t robb'd us of before. But we
were for a con&s;iderable time afterwards pe&s;tered
by contrary Winds, &s;o that we did not come
within &s;ight of the I&s;le <HI>Dauphin,</HI> (called by the
<HI>Portugue&s;es,</HI> St. <HI>Laurence,</HI> and by the Natives, <HI>Ma|daga&s;car,</HI>)
under the 26th Degree of the Southern
Latitude, till 7 Weeks after we had pa&s;s'd the
Tropick of <HI>Capricorn,</HI> on the We&s;t-&s;ide, which did
not a little &s;urprize our Pilates, who believed to
have been on the Ea&s;t &s;ide of it. We were put
to no &s;mall trouble, and endur'd great fatigues,
before we could double the Southern Cape of this
I&s;land, by rea&s;on of the contrary Winds. It was
then that Di&s;tempers began to reign among our
Ships Crew, two thirds of them being di&s;abled
by the Scurvy; this is that &s;o much dreaded Sea-plague,
which the <HI>French</HI> Sea-Men call the Evil
of the Land, becau&s;e it is from thence alone they
expect the cure of this dreadful Di&s;temper. There
were very few of the whole Ships Crew, who
had not their &s;hare of it, and this joyned with
the continual fatigues, occa&s;ioned by the fury of
contrary Winds, put us almo&s;t in de&s;pair, as be|ing
bereaved of all hopes of reaching the Shoar,
if Providence had not delivered us again by Mi|racle.
For the Wind wheeling about, all upon a
<PB N="7" REF="19">
&s;udden, we came 3 Weeks after we had fir&s;t di&s;|covered
the Shoar of <HI>Madaga&s;car,</HI> in &s;ight of the
I&s;le of <HI>Burbon,</HI> (otherwi&s;e called <HI>Ma&s;careigne,</HI>) ha|ving
not lo&s;t above 3 of our whole Crew, yet
we were 4 days longer before we could reach the
Shoar, where we ca&s;t our Anchors, directly op|po&s;ite
to one of the <HI>French</HI> Plantations, called St.
<HI>Paul,</HI> Situate on the We&s;t-&s;ide of the I&s;land; the
fir&s;t thing we had to do was to take care of our
Sick Men, who were brought on Shoar, where
we lo&s;t 2 more of our Men, one being Drowned,

<P>Thus we quitted this dangerous Port,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Leaves</HI> Galam|boule.</NOTE> on the
Twenty fir&s;t of <HI>June,</HI> with a very favourable Gale,
&s;o that on the Twenty &s;ixth of the &s;ame Month,
<PB N="33" REF="32">
we were within &s;ight of the point of <HI>Itapere,</HI>
which is only 3 Leagues di&s;tant from Fort <HI>Dau|phine.</HI></P>
<P>The Pilots frequenting the&s;e Coa&s;ts, are always
very careful to come to an Anchor towards Night,
near this Point, and to &s;tay till Day-light, the
better to avoid the Rocks that are at the Entrance
of the Bay <HI>Dauphine;</HI> but our Pilot being fool|hardy,
continu'd his Cour&s;e all the Night, &s;o that
at break of Day, be&s;ide the danger we had e&s;ca|ped,
of being lo&s;t upon the Shelves and Rocks,
we found our &s;elves a great way below the Bay.
The wor&s;t of all was, that being encouraged by
the hopes of a &s;peedy Pa&s;&s;age, we had not ma|naged
our Provi&s;ions to the be&s;t Advantage, &s;o
that having nothing left, but a &s;mall quantity of
Rice, we began to con&s;ult what was mo&s;t expe|dient
to be done in this pre&s;ent emergency; then
it was at la&s;t re&s;olved to approach the Shoar, and
to Land all tho&s;e whom we had brought along
with us from St. <HI>Mary's</HI> and <HI>Galamboule.</HI> Pur&s;u|ant
to this Re&s;olution, we came to an Anchor in
the Bay of <HI>Galleons,</HI> which received its Name from
&s;ome <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> Galleons that were lo&s;t near this
place. This Bay being not above 3 Leagues from
Fort <HI>Dauphine,</HI> we only &s;tay'd for Day-light, that
we might with the more conveniency di&s;embark
our Men; where on a &s;udden, a fre&s;h Gale ari|&s;ing
from the We&s;t, we immediately &s;et Sail, and
after &s;ome &s;mall difficulties, which we ea&s;ily &s;ur|mounted,
entred the &s;o much de&s;ired Fort about
Noon, on the 5th of <HI>Augu&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>So &s;oon as we found our &s;elves in a place of &s;e|curity,
the whole Ships Crew made their Com|plaints
again&s;t the Captain, who being immedi|ately
di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;s'd, Mon&s;ieur <HI>Lambety,</HI> who had for|merly

<HEAD>CHAP. XIV.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the City of Suratte.</HEAD>
<P>THE City is Situate under the one and Twen|tieth
Degree of North Latitude, and is one of
the mo&s;t con&s;iderable Ports in the Empire of the
<HI>Great Mogul.</HI> It is very large and populous, Built
upon the Banks of a fair River, which runs under
its Walls, and about 3 Leagues from thence di&s;|embogues
into the Sea. When I Arrived near the
City, the Gates were not &s;hut up; the Inhabi|tants
were obliged for their Security to a neigh|bouring
Prince called <HI>Sevagi,</HI> who by his frequent
Incur&s;ions has cau&s;ed them to &s;urround their City
with a good Wall, and to be con&s;tantly upon
their Guard. The Sand Banks which are at the
Entrance of this River, are very uncertain, being
by the violence of the Current frequently tran&s;po|&s;ed
from one place to another, &s;o that they are
rarely to be met withal two Years together in the
&s;ame place, which renders the pa&s;&s;age of Ships both
very trouble&s;ome and dangerous.</P>
<P>The Streets of <HI>Suratte</HI> are hand&s;ome enough,
but they have this inconvenience,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Streets of <HI>Suratte.</HI></NOTE> that they are ve|ry
du&s;ty during the dry Sea&s;on, which the <HI>Indians</HI>
call their Summer, tho' all the time the Sun is at
the greate&s;t di&s;tance from them. To remedy this,
they continually water the Streets, e&s;pecially in
tho&s;e parts where the better &s;ort Inhabit. The Hou|&s;es
<PB N="38" REF="35">
are here but one Story high, tho&s;e of the com|mon
people are covered with Tiles; but people of
Fa&s;hions Hou&s;es are flat at Top, with Terrace
Walks, made with a certain &s;ort of Pla&s;ter; which
appears as beautiful as White Marble, and keeps
out the Rain, they have only a little ri&s;ing in the
middle, for the better convenience of conveying
the Water into the Streets; abundance of people
pa&s;s whole Nights upon the&s;e Terraces, to enjoy
the benefit of the cool Air.</P>
<P>All Hou&s;es of people of any Fa&s;hion, have their
Gardens &s;urrounded with fine Arbours,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Gar|dens.</NOTE> bearing
Grapes twice a Year. Be&s;ides which, they have
great &s;tore of all &s;orts of Flowers, but e&s;pecially
tho&s;e they call <HI>Mougrin,</HI> which being not unlike
our <HI>Ja&s;&s;amin</HI> Flowers, are in great reque&s;t among
the <HI>Indians.</HI> They have al&s;o certain Trees bearing
Flowers, which open at Sun-Ri&s;ing, and fall off
at Sun-Set; and others of which the Flowers open
at Sun-Set, and decay at Sun-ri&s;ing; and the whole
Year being but one continued Spring Sea&s;on in this
Climate, furni&s;hes them always with all &s;orts of
Fruits and Flowers.</P>
<P>People of Quality, nay, even tho&s;e of an Inferi|our
Rank, have their Bathing places, which being
made all of Stone, are extreamly neat. They
make u&s;e of them partly upon the account of their
Religion, partly to allay the violence of the heat

where they &s;ell every thing, which may be u&s;eful
to the Foreign Mariners. There hapned &s;ome
years before my arrival, an unlucky accident to a
<HI>Frenchman</HI> in this Port, which had been likely to
<PB N="42" REF="37">
have proved of very ill con&s;equence. A <HI>Mahome|tan</HI>
came on board a <HI>French</HI> Ve&s;&s;el to cheapen &s;ome
things, and among&s;t the re&s;t, asked them, whether
they had any Pi&s;tols to &s;ell? Several pair having
been &s;hew'd him, he went to di&s;charge one of them
out of a Window in the Cabin, but he, who was
the Seller, finding him very unexpert in handling
of Fire-arms, took one and di&s;charged it him&s;elf;
but the Pi&s;tol being charged with three Bullets, he
unfortunately &s;hot a young Child which was play|ing
a &s;hoar, through the Brea&s;t, of which it died
in&s;tantly. The news of this unfortunate accident
was &s;oon &s;pread, not only through the Village, but
in <HI>Suratte</HI> it &s;elf, where the Rabble began to be mu|tinous,
and to declare publickly, that they would
not re&s;t &s;atisfied, till they had Sacrificed all the <HI>French</HI>
in <HI>Suratte,</HI> and had revenged the Death of the Child
upon a Nation, who made killing and &s;laying their
Pa&s;s-time; &s;o that for &s;everal days together, no
<HI>Frenchman</HI> dur&s;t &s;tir out of the Doors. At la&s;t, the
Per&s;on, who by his carele&s;sne&s;s had been the occa&s;i|on
of this unfortunate accident, having by &s;ome of
his Friends convinced them of his innocence, the
matter was accommodated, and the Tumult cea&s;ed.
For it hapned, that the Child that was killed, be|longed
to <HI>Pagan</HI> Parents, &s;o that they were appea&s;|ed
by the means of a Sum of Money, under condi|tion,
that the who had committed the Fact, &s;hould
not be permitted to come a&s;hoar, but to return into
<HI>Europe,</HI> by the &s;ame Ve&s;&s;el that had brought him
thither. If this Child had been a <HI>Mahometan,</HI> he
would not have come off at &s;o ea&s;ie a rate, but
would have been in no &s;mall danger of his Life, it
being an indi&s;pen&s;able Law, and always religiou&s;ly

<HEAD TYPE="sub">How the Indian Women burn them&s;elves

<P>THE <HI>Indian</HI> Hi&s;tories affirm, That in former A|ges
the&s;e Countries being Governed by <HI>Pagan</HI>
Princes, the Women often grown weary of their
Husbands, made a common practice of ridding their
hands of them by Poi&s;on.<NOTE PLACE="marg">How this Cu&s;tom was introduced.</NOTE> The many tragical in|&s;tances
of this Nature, did oblige at la&s;t tho&s;e Princes
who were not always exempt from the cruel de&s;igns
of the Women, to make a Law, that all Women of
what Age and Quality &s;oever, &s;hould be burnt with
the dead Carca&s;&s;es of their Husbands. To give the
better colour to this cruel Decree, it was back'd by
the &s;pecious pretext of Religion, promi&s;ing a large
&s;hare of Enjoyment to tho&s;e unfortunate Creatures,
in the other World. Be&s;ides, that the <HI>Bramans</HI> paid
them very near the &s;ame reverence as to their Dei|ties,
by which vain glory the crafty Prie&s;ts having
gained upon the Weakne&s;s of their Sex, they fre|quently
cho&s;e to make a vertue of nece&s;&s;ity, and by
<PB N="48" REF="40">
a voluntary Act, to render their Deaths more glo|rious.</P>
<P>Many Ages after the <HI>Mahometans</HI> being become
Ma&s;ters of the greate&s;t part of the <HI>Indies,</HI> were for
aboli&s;hing this dreadful Cu&s;tom of forcing People to
be their own Executioners; for which rea&s;on it was
ordained, that none &s;hould be con&s;trained to
Sacrifice them&s;elves at their Husbands Funerals, but
that they &s;hould be left to their liberty, either to &s;ur|vive
or die with them.</P>
<P>The Governours are in Per&s;on to examine &s;uch of
the <HI>Pagan</HI> Women as offer them&s;elves to be Burnt;
they are to endeavour by all fair means and per&s;wa|&s;ions,
to divert them from their de&s;igns, and if they
per&s;i&s;t in their Re&s;olution, they are obliged to give
their con&s;ent, but withall to keep them under a
&s;trict Guard, for fear, that if they &s;hould happen
to change their mind, they may not be re&s;cued out
of their hands. They look upon this as a very ne|ce&s;&s;ary
precaution, the better to oblige them to re|flect
&s;eriou&s;ly upon what they undertake, before
they enter upon &s;o fatal a Re&s;olution; for there have
not been wanting in&s;tances of tho&s;e, who at fir&s;t
courted and demanded Death from the Governours
with an undaunted Courage, who have been &s;tart|led
and trembled at the &s;ight of the Funeral Pile,
and too late repented them&s;elves of their ra&s;h Vows.</P>

certain place, called <HI>Soulpara,</HI> where there is one of
the mo&s;t famous Temples of the whole Province,
it being their Cu&s;tom upon &s;uch an occa&s;ion, to be as
near a Temple and the Water as they can; then
the Widow is brought thither in Triumph on Hor&s;e
Back, mo&s;t magnificently attired with a Garland of
Flowers about her Head; &s;he is &s;urrounded by &s;e|veral
that play upon Mu&s;ical In&s;truments, and fol|lowed
by her Kindred and Friends, who Dance and
<PB N="49" REF="40">
Sing for joy, to have &s;uch a Heroine in their Fami|ly,
or to be allyed to her by Friend&s;hip. Some|times
they are carried by Water; when the dead
Corps is laid in the Boat, &s;o as that the Widow,
who is &s;eated upon a Chair, may &s;et her Feet a|gain&s;t
it.</P>
<P>Being arrived at the place, the dead Corps is laid
upon the Bank of the River, where the Widow
wa&s;hes it; which done, it is carried into a little
Hut of &s;even or eight foot &s;quare, made for that
purpo&s;e of very dry Wood, covered with Reed,
dip'd in Oil, Ro&s;in and Brim&s;tone, to render it the
more Combu&s;tible; it has a little Door through
which the dead Body being conveyed into the place,
the Widow comes out of the Water, and thus wet,
takes &s;everal rounds about the Funeral Pile, which
done, &s;he embraces her Children, if &s;he have any,
and the re&s;t of her Kindred or Friends there pre&s;ent,
among whom having di&s;tributed what precious
moveables &s;he has about her, they are removed at a

her.<NOTE PLACE="marg">How they burn them|&s;elves.</NOTE> Thus prepared &s;he enters the fatal place,
where &s;he is to &s;acrifice her &s;elf, and being &s;eated
upon a heap of Straw, mix'd with Brim&s;tone, near
the dead Carca&s;s of her Husband, a <HI>Braman</HI> exhorts
her to con&s;tancy, comforting her with the hopes of
being &s;oon reunited with her own better half; then
he gives her a Torch in one hand, and &s;ome leaves

of all Pa&s;&s;ages and Circum&s;tances that attend it; &s;he

&s;he with her own hands &s;et fire to the combu&s;tible

Pile, &s;o that I could exactly &s;ee her lift up her de|cea&s;ed
Husband's Head, and pre&s;s her Cheeks to his,
which done, &s;he pulled her Veil over her Face,
and died without the lea&s;t appearance of regret.</P>
<P>Some time after, I &s;aw &s;uch another Spectacle.
She that was to be &s;acrificed, was not quite &s;o young
as the former, and had pre&s;s'd the Execution of her
Vow with a great deal of Re&s;olution, which how|ever
began to fail her at that very time when &s;he
&s;tood mo&s;t in need of it; for, &s;carce was &s;he en|clo&s;ed
within the Funeral Pile, but &s;he &s;trove by all
means po&s;&s;ible to get out, but the <HI>Braman</HI> immedi|ately
&s;et fire to the Combu&s;tible Materials, and thus
forced her to undergo that cruel fate, which &s;he had
&s;ought for with &s;o much eagerne&s;s. So &s;oon as the
Bodies are con&s;umed by the Fire, their A&s;hes are
thrown into the next River, and the Families of
tho&s;e Women who thus have &s;acrificed them&s;elves,

only by Fi&s;her-Men, and 4 Leagues beyond it
<PB N="56" REF="44">
is the City of <HI>Rajapour,</HI> which has Communicated
its Name to the &s;aid River. You may go up with
a Ve&s;&s;el of 100 Tuns, as far as to a &s;mall I&s;land,
which is about half way betwixt the City and the
Mouth of the River; afterwards you make u&s;e of
<HI>Chaloups</HI> and Barges, to carry the Merchandice
to the City, where the River is &s;o &s;hallow that
at low Water it is fordable in &s;ome places.</P>
<P>The <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> had here formerly a Factory, but
the <HI>Indians</HI> have di&s;lodged them from thence. The

The chief Commodities at <HI>Rajapour,</HI> are Saltperer

thereabouts in great quantity.</P>
<P>This <HI>Sevagi</HI> is a very Potent Prince,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Prince</HI> Se|vagi.</NOTE> who has

made the City of <HI>Goa</HI> it &s;elf Tremble at his Ap|proach,
and has &s;everal times made tho&s;e of <HI>Su|ratte</HI>
feel the direful effects of his Fury, by Plun|dering
all the Country round about, and carrying
away great Riches, without &s;paring either Mo&s;ques
or the <HI>Pagan</HI> Temples. But it has been ob&s;erved
of him, that he always u&s;ed a great deal of mode|ration
towards the <HI>Europeans,</HI> perhaps for fear of
being called to a &s;evere account by their Princi|pals&punc;
which Motive might induce him to &s;hew

have Plundered their Hou&s;es, like tho&s;e of the <HI>In|dians.</HI>
In the Year 1671. he made &s;uch an inroad

terrible a havock in the circumjacent places, that
the damage could not be repair'd for many Years

about 18 Leagues South of <HI>Goa,</HI> where the <HI>French</HI>

of a con&s;iderable bigne&s;s, &s;urrounded with a deep

was a <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> by Birth, who's Name being <HI>C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">jab|della,</HI>
treated us with all imaginable Civility. For
no &s;ooner had he been adverti&s;ed of our Arrival,
but he came to vi&s;it our Captain, and before his
departure invited us all to Supper, tho' it was not
as yet Dinner-time; he was &s;o much delighted with
our Company, that he oblig'd us to go along with
him, &s;o that we followed him to his Palace, &s;ome

<P>As &s;oon as we were come within the Ca&s;tle,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An <HI>Indian</HI> Fea&s;t.</NOTE> we
were brought into a &s;pacious Room hang'd all o|ver

&s;eated round about him upon Cu&s;hions made of the

Compliment the Governour in our behalf, when
we &s;aw come into the Room a Band of Women
Dancers, which he had ordred to appear there for our
Diver&s;ion; the&s;e Women make profe&s;&s;ion of Dan|cing

get a livelihood. They Dance with an extraordi|nary
activity, and an exact ob&s;ervance of the Ca|dence,
but their Ge&s;tures are not very mode&s;t, they
are generally well &s;haped, and appear very &s;ump|tuous
in their Apparel. This Ball which la&s;ted the
greate&s;t part of the Day, was diverting enough to
us, by rea&s;on of the Novelty of the Spectacle; but
we were extreamly fatigued by the long continu|ance
of the &s;hew, becau&s;e we had not &s;o much as

ten People for a Meal; but, becau&s;e the Tree dies
&s;oon after the Fruit is gathered, they commonly cut
down the Tree near the Root, when they intend

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of Pepper, Cardamon, Cinnamon and Bethel.</HEAD>
<P>THE Shrub which bears the Pepper is always
planted near other great Trees, which keep
it upright; its leaves are very like the Ivy, who&s;e
&s;mell is as biting to the No&s;trils, as the Fruit is to
the Tongue. The Pepper &s;prouts forth in &s;mall
Bunches; its colour is Green at fir&s;t, but turns Red
when it comes to Maturity, and after it has been
dry'd in the Sun, appears &s;uch as we &s;ee it in <HI>Eu|rope.</HI>
There is but one kind, the difference betwixt
the Black and White (according to the opinion of
the vulgar) being nothing el&s;e, but that the fir&s;t re|tains
<PB N="67" REF="49">
its native husk, whereas the other is peeled,
which they do by thra&s;hing it with &s;mall &s;ticks be|fore
it be quite dry, or after it is dryed, by &s;oaking
it for a little while in Water, and then rub off the
outward peel; by which means, every body that has
black Pepper, may &s;oon convert it into White, if
he will take the trouble to do it.</P>
<P>The <HI>Indians</HI> pre&s;erve it with Sugar whil&s;t it is
Green,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Pepper pre|&s;erved.</NOTE> and make al&s;o a Pickle of it with Vinegar,
which they call <HI>Achar,</HI> a name they give to all their
Pickles made with Vinegar.</P>
<P>The Pepper grows in a great many places, but
no where in &s;uch abundance as from <HI>Rajapour,</HI> as far
as to Cape <HI>Comorin;</HI> the large&s;t &s;ort comes from

the other, but it multiplies fa&s;ter, and mo&s;t Nati|ons
furni&s;h them&s;elves with Pepper in tho&s;e parts,

<P>The <HI>Cardamom</HI> grows in the Kingdom of <HI>Cananor</HI>
near a certain Mountain,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cardamom.</NOTE> about &s;ix or &s;even Leagues
di&s;tant from the Sea-&s;ide, this being the only place
in the whole World where it grows; this &s;pot of

They need neither Sow nor Plant it, all the
pains they are obliged to take, is, to burn the Herbs
after the rainy Sea&s;on is over, which grow there a|bouts;
the A&s;hes of which produce the Carda|mom.</P>
<P>It is tran&s;ported from hence all over the <HI>Indies</HI> in|to

Panthle,</HI> ought not to be pa&s;s'd by in &s;i|lence
in this place. They grow on Shrubs like
the Pepper, and are not unlike the Ivy Leaves as
well as the others; but they have a plea&s;ant aro|matick
flavour, their natural Colour being Green.
They whiten them without the lea&s;t prejudice to
their native vertue, by laying them in Wooden
Casks, made out of the <HI>Bananas</HI> Tree, and by
&s;prinkling them with Water once a day. They
never chew them without the <HI>Areque;</HI> this is a
&s;mall Fruit,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Areque.</NOTE> very like our Green Wall-Nuts, which
they lay in water to make the Peel rotten. The
<HI>Areque</HI> has a very offen&s;ive &s;mell, whil&s;t it is fre&s;h,
but being dried, retains nothing of its ill &s;cent; it
is a little biting upon the Tongue, and promotes
Spitting.</P>
<P>The Chaw made of the <HI>Bethel</HI> they prepare
thus:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Indian <HI>Chaw.</HI></NOTE></P>
<P>They take about the quantity of a Pea of Chalk
or Lime, which they put among 3 or 4 Leaves
of <HI>Bethel,</HI> and mix with it a fourth part of an <HI>Are|que</HI>
Nut, which they will u&s;e together, and chaw
it at plea&s;ure. There are &s;ome of the <HI>Indians,</HI>
who add to it a few Grains of Cardamom, a &s;mall
quantity of Cloves and Cinnamon, which gives it
a very agreeable ta&s;te. The Tree which produces
the <HI>Areque,</HI> grows &s;traight, without Branches, on|ly
a few Leaves on the Top; the Wood is tolera|bly
good for Building, but mo&s;t us'd for Ma&s;ts of
Barges, they being not &s;trong enough for large Ve&s;|&s;els.</P>
<P>The Chaw being thus prepared, fortifies the Sto|mach,
promotes Dige&s;tion, and leaves a good &s;mell
behind it, moi&s;tens the Mouth, and dyes the Spit|tle
and Lips red; from whence without Que&s;ti|on
is ari&s;en this vulgar error, that &s;ome have affir|med
it makes the Gums Bleed.</P>
<P>It is a great Specifick again&s;t the Stone, as I my
&s;elf have Experienc'd &s;everal times, when I pre|&s;cribed
<PB N="69" REF="50">
it to &s;ome of my Acquaintance in that
ca&s;e. And what may &s;erve as a confirmation of
what I have a&s;&s;erted as to this particular, it is to be
ob&s;erved that in tho&s;e places, where it is frequent|ly
u&s;ed; I never met with any body that was
Afflicted with this Di&s;temper.</P>
<P>Before a Man is u&s;ed to this Chaw, it will cau&s;e
a Dizzine&s;s, occa&s;ioned by the <HI>Areque,</HI> but this
may in a great mea&s;ure be prevented, by well
clean&s;ing the &s;aid Fruit, from a certain white &s;ub|&s;tance,
which is within it. The <HI>Europeans</HI> who
have for &s;ome time lived in the <HI>Indies,</HI> are gene|rally
as fond of this Chaw as the <HI>Indians</HI> them|&s;elves;
and the Leaves of the <HI>Bethel</HI> as common as
they are, are neverthele&s;s in great e&s;teem, as well
among Per&s;ons of the fir&s;t Rank, as the meane&s;t
Pea&s;ants. If you pay a Vi&s;it to any body here,
the fir&s;t thing which is pre&s;ented is a Roll of this
Chaw; if you &s;hould let a Friend go out of your
Hou&s;e without it, he would take it as a gro&s;s Af|front,
and &s;o it would be look'd upon on the other
hand, if he &s;hould refu&s;e to accept it; neverthe|le&s;s,
no body is oblig'd to take it upon the &s;pot,
the <HI>A&s;iaticks</HI> in general being very jealous of one
another, and extreamly fearful of Poy&s;on.</P>
<P>There is a certain Tree all over the <HI>Indies,</HI> but
more e&s;pecially in <HI>Malabar,</HI> which grows to a con|&s;iderable
height, its Leaves are like tho&s;e of the

whiti&s;h Flower of a very good &s;cent; out of the
Stem di&s;tills a Gum, which is very u&s;eful for Ships;
but what is particularly remarkable in this Tree,
is, that its Branches after they are grown up to
&s;ome height, turn downwards again to the Ground,
where as &s;oon as they touch they take root, and
in proce&s;s of time, grow equal in bulk to the fir&s;t

how they could never lie down, and if by mi&s;chance

under his Feet, whil&s;t the other tore his Skin in

<P>IN <HI>Malabar</HI> the Tigers are found in greater num|bers
than in any other part of the <HI>Indies.</HI> Of
the&s;e Creatures &s;o famous for their Cruelties,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Several &s;orts of Tigers.</NOTE> there
are three &s;orts, di&s;tingui&s;hed only by their different
&s;izes.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t is not much bigger than a large Cat; of
this kind I &s;aw one, which was kept in the Hou&s;e
of the <HI>French Ea&s;t-India</HI> Company, in the Kingdom
of <HI>Cananor,</HI> which was brought thither from <HI>Mir|&s;cou,</HI>
and when he cry'd, made as much noi&s;e as
an Ox. They fed him commonly with Fle&s;h, and
if they threw him &s;ome Rice, he was &s;o cunning as
to draw back as far as the Chain would give him
leave when he would watch his opportunity to
&s;natch up the Pullets and Ducks that came to feed
upon the Rice; at la&s;t our Tiger found means one
time to break his Chain, and to give us the Slip. I
was one of the foremo&s;t who pur&s;ued him, but got
nothing for my pains, but a Wound, which he
gave me with his Claws in the right hand, and &s;o
he got into the open Fields, where we were not a|ble
to overtake him.</P>
<P>The &s;econd kind is as big as a good Mutton,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The &s;econd kind.</NOTE> or
a &s;lender Calf; the&s;e as they are mo&s;t common, &s;o
they do the mo&s;t mi&s;chief among the Cattle, and
are therefore mo&s;t clo&s;ely pur&s;ued. The Princes in
tho&s;e parts to encourage their Subjects to de&s;troy
the&s;e mi&s;chievous Creatures, give always a

as a Badge of Honour, not unlike to our Knight|hood,
no body being allowed to wear a Golden
Bracelet here, without being authorized to it by
the King of that Country, who&s;e &s;ubject he is.</P>
<P>I was acquainted with an <HI>Indian,</HI> who alone kill'd
one of the&s;e Tigers, without receiving the lea&s;t
hurt, and had no other Arms but his Shield and Ci|metar.</P>
<P>The <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> re&s;iding at <HI>Batiepatan,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">A Tiger kills three <HI>Engli&s;h.</HI></NOTE> had not the
&s;ame good fortune with a Tiger which u&s;ed to
come now and then into their Grounds in the Night-time.
For having made great Havock all round
their Habitations for a con&s;iderable time, they took
a re&s;olution to watch his coming; for which pur|po&s;e,
having provided them&s;elves with Fire-arms,
they met and wounded him with a Ball out of a Fu|zee,
but the Wound not proving mortal, the Ti|ger
fell in among them with &s;uch a Fury, that he
killed two or three of them, and got away.</P>
<P>I was once my &s;elf in no &s;mall danger of having
been &s;urprized by this cruel Animal, not long af|ter
my arrival in <HI>Malabar.</HI> The exce&s;&s;ive heat of
the Sea&s;on, made me very de&s;irous to lay abroad
very often, having three great Dogs near me for my
Guard. One Night I was all on a &s;udden awaken|ed
by their Cries, and &s;eeing them fly away as
fa&s;t as they could from a certain Animal, that pur|&s;ued
them with great Eagerne&s;s; I called for help,
and &s;ome of our Dome&s;ticks being come with ligh|ted
Torches to my a&s;&s;i&s;tance, we found two of the
Dogs, which were returned to the place where they
had left me, but the third was mi&s;&s;ing; we look'd
all about as far as we could, but in vain, not being
able to learn any tidings of our Dog till the next
day, when we found his Bones &s;cattered at two
hundred paces from the Hou&s;e. This adventure
&s;erved me for a warning, not to expo&s;e my &s;elf thus
for the future, by lying abroad all Night.</P>
<P>The Tiger of the third kind is near as big as a
Hor&s;e,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The third kind of Ti|gers.</NOTE> the <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> call it the <HI>Royal Tiger.</HI> I never

<P>I was acquainted with a certain Gentleman, a
<HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> by Birth, who&s;e name was <HI>John de Liquiera,</HI>
living at <HI>Daman:</HI> He had a Country Hou&s;e near
the &s;aid City, whither two Friends of his being come
to give him a Vi&s;it, he would needs divert them
with Hunting the wild Boar; going out early in the
Morning, in a Cala&s;h, each with a Fuzee, they
met with one of the&s;e <HI>Royal Tigers,</HI> and &s;eeing him
at &s;ome di&s;tance, they agreed it would be be&s;t to
let fly at him, which <HI>John de Liquiera</HI> did with &s;o much
dexterity,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A remark|able Hi&s;to|ry of a Ti|ger.</NOTE> that he dropt down immediately, with|out
the lea&s;t appearance of life; it is ea&s;ie to be
conceived that they were extreamly rejoyced at
their Victory, which they had gained at &s;o cheap
a rate, and being in a &s;olitary place, not far from
<HI>Liquiera</HI>'s Country Hou&s;e, they re&s;olved to leave
their Prey, (which is e&s;teemed a great rarity by rea|&s;on
of the Beauty of the Skin) till they had broke
their Fa&s;t. But afterwards returning to the place,
they were not a little &s;urprized when they found
neither the Tiger nor any tract of Blood; &s;o that
<HI>John de Liquiera</HI> again&s;t the advice of his Friends,
getting out of the Cala&s;h into the adjacent Bu&s;hes,
found the Tiger there wallowing in his own Blood;
but the enraged Animal, as if it had been &s;en&s;ible
of the approach of him who had given him his mor|tal
Wound,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A <HI>Portu|gue&s;e</HI> in danger of being torn in pieces by a Tiger.</NOTE> flew upon him with &s;o much fury,
that he threw him immediately upon the Ground,
and fell a tearing his Fle&s;h, where ever he fixed his
Claws. His other two Friends, who had follow'd
him at &s;ome di&s;tance, were at the greate&s;t incerti|tude
what to do in this extremity, they wanting
Arms to come to a clo&s;e Engagement with the Tiger&punc;
to re&s;cue their Friend, and they dur&s;t not make u&s;e of
their Fire-arms for fear of killing him in&s;tead of the
cruel Bea&s;t; their only hopes was, that the Tiger
<PB N="80" REF="56">
would be &s;oon di&s;abled by the lo&s;s of Blood, which
flowed like a &s;tream out of his Wound; but per|ceiving
his fiercene&s;s rather increa&s;e than abate, they
re&s;olved to venture all, and advancing as near as
they thought convenient, one of them &s;hot the Ti|ger
with his Fuzee, &s;o as that he drop'd down
dead upon the &s;pot. They ran immediately to the
a&s;&s;i&s;tance of their Friend, whom they found with
his Face downwards, and his back and &s;ides torn in
&s;o mi&s;erable a manner, that it was the mo&s;t tragical
Spectacle that ever was &s;een; they made a &s;hift to
carry him to his own Hou&s;e, where having laid him
upon a Bed, they found his Wounds in &s;o de&s;perate
a condition, that they expected every moment,
when he would breath his la&s;t.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t they were in this confu&s;ion, no body
knowing what to re&s;olve on, one of the <HI>Pagan</HI>
Slaves belonging to this Gentleman, having been
informed of his Ma&s;ter's misfortune, came into the
Room, and told them, That if they would leave
him to his care, he would certainly &s;ave him. There
was &s;carce any body who made any great reflections
upon what the Slave had a&s;&s;ured them; but looking
upon their Friends ca&s;e as de&s;perate, they accepted
his offer: And the Slave went immediately to apply
his remedy, which was made of the juice of certain
Herbs mix'd with Milk,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Marvellous cure.</NOTE> by the help of which he
in time re&s;tored his Ma&s;ter to perfect Health, or|dering
him all the while, nothing el&s;e for his Dyet,
but Bread and Milk; a cure &s;o miraculous, as &s;carce

<P>This &s;ame Gentleman, who has given me the

to this day the Skin of this Tiger, which being a|bove
&s;ix foot long, &s;erves him as a la&s;ting remem|brance
of this dreadful Adventure.</P>
<P>To avoid the Tigers in the Night-time, nothing
is more proper than to keep a Candle or &s;ome other
Light near one, which they avoid to come near&punc;
But in the Day-time you mu&s;t be provided with
<PB N="81" REF="56">
good Fire-arms, or a Bow, to let fly at him, be|fore
he comes too near you; but you mu&s;t be &s;ure of
your hits, for if you do not wound him mortally,
he becomes more furious, and you will be in great

from whence i&s;&s;ues that venomous &s;ub&s;tance, which

<P>A Secretary belonging to a certain Prince in tho&s;e

who threatned to burn the Adder, if She did not

Adder being very &s;tubborn as it &s;eems, their Prayers

ordered the Adder to be carried out of his Palace,

Prie&s;ts&punc;) ought to be dete&s;ted by all the World.
There are among them &s;ome very well skilled in
A&s;trology, who have received &s;ome Tincture of

of the <HI>Indian</HI> Nations, and who con&s;equently
cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed to believe them&s;elves, what
they impo&s;e upon the Vulgar; I have often en|tred
in Di&s;cour&s;e with them upon that Subject,
and more e&s;pecially with one who was my fami|liar
Acquaintance, whom I u&s;ed to upbraid with
their impo&s;tures, and in what abominable a man|ner
they mi&s;employed that talent, wherewith they
were intru&s;ted by God; in thus gro&s;ly impo&s;ing
upon the credulity of an ignorant people by their
fabulous inventions, barely in hopes of gaining
&s;ome reputation, and a &s;lender &s;hare of worldly
intere&s;t. He was &s;o far from being moved or con|vinced
with what I alledged to him, that on the
<PB N="88" REF="60">
contrary he per&s;i&s;ted in ju&s;tifying their proceed|ings,
and had folly enough to endeavour to per|&s;wade
me of the verity of their Doctrine by the
following Hi&s;tory. One of the Principal <HI>Bra|mans,</HI>
belonging to one of the mo&s;t famous Tem|ples
among the <HI>Malabars,</HI> being very &s;olicitous to
exhort his Auditors to Devotion, propo&s;ed to them
the erecting a Statue of Gold of an Adder, with
12 Eggs of the &s;ame &s;ub&s;tance, which being to be
effected by a voluntary Contribution, and the Sta|tue
to be placed in a certain place within the Tem|ple,
where it was to be Adored, he told them
that the &s;ame Statue in 6 Weeks time would not
only be turn'd into a live Adder of the &s;ame
bigne&s;s, but al&s;o hatch out of the 12 Eggs, &s;o
many young ones, that would in time all become
Protectors of the &s;aid Temple. His propo&s;ition
being received with a general&punc; con&s;ent, they con|tributed
towards the erecting of the &s;aid Statue
with &s;uch a chearfulne&s;s, that it was &s;oon brought
to perfection, and carried in great State by the
<HI>Bramans,</HI> followed by the joyful Acclamations of
a va&s;t number of people to the Temple, where
it was &s;et up in a place a&s;&s;igned for that purpo&s;e,
which was &s;hut up clo&s;e by the principal <HI>Braman,</HI>
till the 6 Weeks were expired; when having a|gain
a&s;&s;embled the people, he went at the Head
of them to the &s;ame place where they had left the
Statue lock'd up before; and not finding the lea&s;t
Remnants either of the Golden Adder, or the 12
Eggs, they unanimou&s;ly concluded that they were
all turn'd into Living Adders. The Miracle was
followed by an univer&s;al Acclamation of the peo|ple,
each of them &s;triving to out-do the other, in
giving the mo&s;t evident Demon&s;trations of Joy
for having been the happy In&s;truments of the pro|duction
of tho&s;e new Deities.</P>
<P>Tho' I could &s;carce forbear Laughing at the foo|li&s;hne&s;s
of this contrivance, yet the impudence
wherewith it was related by the <HI>Braman</HI> put me
into &s;uch a Pa&s;&s;ion, that I gave him &s;ufficiently to
<PB N="89" REF="60">
under&s;tand that I was not to be impo&s;ed upon by
&s;uch Tricks; but he was &s;o brazen faced as to per|&s;i&s;t
in his former a&s;&s;urance, &s;o that I was forced to
leave him to his own ob&s;tinacy.</P>
<P>But tho' the <HI>Pagans</HI> have impo&s;ed upon them|&s;elves
this as an unalterable Law, not to kill an Ad|der,
the <HI>Chri&s;tians</HI> and <HI>Mahometans</HI> are not obliged
to the &s;ame rule in the <HI>Indies,</HI> where you often

u&s;e of again&s;t the Poy&s;on of this Creature, I &s;hall

<P>The Adders of the large&s;t &s;ize, are near 20 Foot
long, and of &s;o va&s;t a thickne&s;s, that they are able
to &s;wallow a Man; but they are le&s;s dangerous

that they are &s;carce ever to be met with, unle&s;s it

carried near to the abovementioned places; I ne|ver
&s;aw any of them but what were Dead, which
appear'd no otherwi&s;e than a Trunk of a large Tree

&s;ome out-cries of the Child, which, being weary

did not know by what means to pre&s;erve the Child

&s;hou'd do any thing to exa&s;perate this Creature,
it would at once devour the Child; after &s;everal
propo&s;itions made by the beholders of &s;o Tragi|cal
a Spectacle equally dangerous in the execution
of it, they re&s;olved to try whether they could with
a good Cimetar cut the Adder a&s;under in the mid|dle,
which was executed accordingly, with a great
deal of dexterity. But this venomous Creature
was &s;o &s;trong lived, as not to die immediately af|ter

all the Kingdoms on the Coa&s;t of <HI>Malabar;</HI> that
all Strangers or others, who are not <HI>Pagans,</HI> are ob|liged
never to Travel without a Guard of one or
more of the&s;e <HI>Nahers;</HI> this being an indi&s;pen&s;ible
nece&s;&s;ity laid upon Travellers; becau&s;e the&s;e Prin|ces
never take cogni&s;ance of any violences offered
them, if they Travel without the&s;e Guards. If
they are to Travel from one Kingdom to another,
the <HI>Nahers</HI> of the place where they are, take care
to procure them out of the other Kingdoms, whi|ther
they intend to go, &s;ome who are to conduct
them. To every one of the&s;e <HI>Nahers</HI> you pay eight
<HI>Tares per diem,</HI> which amounts to half a <HI>Fanon.</HI>
The <HI>Fanon</HI> is a &s;mall piece of Gold worth 16 <HI>Tares;</HI>
and the <HI>Tare</HI> is a &s;mall Silver Coin worth about a
half-penny. Each <HI>Naher</HI> has not above 4 <HI>Tares</HI> a
day, when he keeps Guard in a Hou&s;e, but when
he Travels he has double pay.</P>
<P>The&s;e <HI>Nahers</HI> have this mo&s;t excellent quality,
that they never betray or abandon &s;uch Travellers
as they Guard upon the Road. If a Man happen
to lo&s;e his Life, whil&s;t he is under their protecti|on,
they will not &s;urvive him, but undergo the
&s;ame fate; if they &s;hould do otherwi&s;e, they would
be look'd upon as Cowards.</P>
<P><PB N="95" REF="63">
I have received a relation from very good Hands,
which well de&s;erves to be in&s;erted here: Two
Rich <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> Merchants Travelling along the
<HI>Malabar</HI> Coa&s;t, from the Northern to the Southern
parts, were pur&s;uant to the Cu&s;tom of the Coun|try
Conducted by &s;everal <HI>Nahers,</HI> through the King|dom
of <HI>Cananor;</HI> but coming to the Borders of
the Kingdom of <HI>Samorin,</HI> were provided with new
Guards, to protect them in their Journey through
that Kingdom. But the&s;e perfidious wretches be|ing
inticed by the great quantity of Gold and
Jewels the&s;e Merchants carried with them, Ma&s;|&s;acred
them, and having robbed them of all their
Precious Moveables, retired to another Kingdom,
in hopes to find &s;helter there again&s;t the &s;everity
of the Law. After the fir&s;t, to who&s;e care they
were committed, were returned to their homes,
the News of the Murther &s;oon &s;pread over the
Country, their Dead Carca&s;&s;es having &s;oon after
the Fact was commited, been di&s;covered by &s;ome
others Travelling on the &s;ame Road; they were
examined concerning their Conduct, and having
given an exact Account, to who&s;e care they had
left the&s;e Merchants, the&s;e Ruffians Names were
&s;oon known, and con&s;equently they were appre|hended,
and &s;ent to their Native Country, to re|ceive
condign Puni&s;hment. Some part of the Trea|&s;ure
which they had taken from the <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI>
Merchants being found upon them, when they
were &s;eized, was a convincing proof of their Guilt,
wherefore being Condemned to Death, their Wives
and neare&s;t Kindred appear'd at the place of Ex|ecution,
telling them, <HI>That &s;ince they had Commit|ted
a Fact tending &s;o much to the Di&s;honour of their
Family, they ought to be the Executioners, and &s;o di&s;|patch'd
them out of the way.</HI></P>
<P>There is another thing worth ob&s;erving of the&s;e
<HI>Nahers;</HI> That Travellers who are Conducted by
a good number of the&s;e Guards, are often expo|&s;ed
to more danger, than if they were guided by
one of their Children; it being the cu&s;tom of the
<PB N="96" REF="64">
<HI>Indian</HI> Robbers, never to hurt any Children or
&s;uch as are not able to defend them&s;elves; but
never to &s;pare any that are provided with Arms for
their Defence.</P>
<P>When the&s;e Children of the <HI>Nahers</HI> Travel in|to
the Country, they are only provided with a
twi&s;ted Stick of a Foot and a half long, with a
handle a-top mo&s;t like our Daggers or Bagonets;
but in lieu of being &s;harp at the end, it is as thick
at the bottom as a Fi&s;t; and this kind of Stick
they make u&s;e of till they come to the Age ap|pointed
for their bearing of Arms. No body but
the Sons of the <HI>Nahers</HI> are permitted to wear &s;uch
a Stick, by which they are di&s;tingui&s;h'd from the
re&s;t, and when they thus Travel, they are not
allowed above three half-pence a day apiece.
But though this be the &s;ecure&s;t way of Travel|ling,
none but the Poorer &s;ort make u&s;e of them,
becau&s;e that Travellers are commonly re&s;pected
in this Country according to the number of Guards,
which attend them from one place to ano|ther.</P>

<HI>Indian,</HI> the Daughter of a <HI>Braman,</HI> who had been
&s;urprized in the very act with a <HI>Tive</HI> or Country|man.
He happening to pa&s;s by our Habitation

began to feel at fir&s;t &s;ome tender &s;entiments for

till the young Countryman being become &s;en&s;ible of
her Pa&s;&s;ion, did by degrees &s;o &s;trongly in&s;inuate
him&s;elf into her Affection, that in &s;pite of all the ri|gour

into her Uncle's Hou&s;e, which was done according|ly

as to be &s;urprized the very fir&s;t time,

her Eyes to the revenge of her Family, and &s;he

<P>They have no clo&s;e or barricado'd Pri&s;ons in <HI>Ma|labar,</HI>

they are only Ioaden with Fetters, which are ne|ver
taken off till they are either Di&s;charged or Ex|ecuted.</P>
<P>All cau&s;es both Civil and Criminal are pleaded

Evidences; if the accu&s;ation appear &s;o doubtful as
not to be decided according to the Evidence produ|ced,

which is performed in the following manner.</P>
<P>They cau&s;e a piece of Iron,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Manner of taking the Oath by the <HI>Mala|bars.</HI></NOTE> not unlike an hat|chet
to be made red hot in the pre&s;ence of him who

his Hand a leaf of the Bananas Tree, and a top
of that the hot Iron, which he is not to throw upon
<PB N="101" REF="66">
the Ground, till after the redne&s;s be gone; after
which, one who has the over&s;ight over the Prince's
Laundry, &s;tanding by with a Napkin dipp'd in
water made of Rice, wraps it about his Hand,
and after having tied round about it a certain
Cord or Ribband, the Prince Seals it up with his
Signet: Three days after the Hand is opened,
and if there be no marks of any hurt done by the
Hot Iron, he is declared innocent; but if there
appear any impre&s;&s;ion made by the heat of the
Iron, he is look'd upon as a Perjur'd Per&s;on, and
Puni&s;h'd accordingly.</P>
<P>It is the Prince in Per&s;on, who is always to pro|nounce
Sentence, from whence there lies no Ap|peal;
and if the Criminal be Condemn'd to Death,
it is Executed immediately upon the Spot, only
leading him without the Precinct of the Royal Pa|lace.</P>
<P>As the <HI>Indians</HI> in the&s;e parts look upon it as the
mo&s;t glorious Action they can do, to Obey their Prince
without re&s;erve, they have no occa&s;ion to employ
common Executioners upon &s;uch like occa&s;ions,
but the <HI>Nahers</HI> belonging to the Prince's Guards
are the mo&s;t forward to execute his Orders again&s;t
the&s;e mi&s;erable Wretches; nay, nothing is more
common, than if the Crime be very heinous, for
the next Kindred of the Criminal, to &s;trive who
&s;hall be the fir&s;t that &s;hall give the fatal blow to his
Kin&s;man, to expiate as they &s;ay, the indignity he
has put upon the Family.</P>
<P>Their common way of putting Criminals to
Death, is&punc; by running a Lance quite through their
Bodies, after which, they cut them into Quarters,
which are hang'd upon Trees.</P>
<P>In each Kingdom among the <HI>Malabars,</HI> there are
&s;everal Princely Families, which are altogether
de&s;cended and make up one Royal Line, &s;uperi|our
in Rank to all the re&s;t. It is a general Cu&s;tom
in all the States of the <HI>Malabars,</HI> that after the De|cea&s;e

<P>The fir&s;t thing the New King does after his ele|vation
to the Throne,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their right of Succe&s;&s;i|on.</NOTE> is, to chu&s;e one from a|mong
his own Subjects, whom he believes to be
mo&s;t under&s;tanding and fitte&s;t for &s;o high a Tru&s;t,
for his Lieutenant-General, who's Bu&s;ine&s;s is to
take upon him, the chief management of all Af|fairs
of Moment. This is the highe&s;t dignity in
the State, and though it be always expo&s;ed to
Sail, yet does the King re&s;erve to him&s;elf the Pre|rogative
of choo&s;ing out of the Pretenders, &s;uch a
one as he likes be&s;t, and whom he thinks mo&s;t
de&s;erving, without any regard to his Birth or Qua|lity;
&s;o that a <HI>Naher</HI> or <HI>Chati,</HI> being inve&s;ted with
this Dignity, will make him&s;elf to be obeyed by
the Princes them&s;elves; tho' it happens al&s;o very
often that this Office is conferred upon Per&s;ons of
Eminent Quality. All their Acts and Letters Pa|tents
are written with a kind of an Iron Pen, upon
the Leaves of the Wild Palm-Tree.</P>
<P>The King being fully &s;atisfied in the Zeal and
Prudence of his Chief Mini&s;ter of State, leaves
the whole management of Affairs to his Conduct,
and for the mo&s;t part Lives in a retired place, but
with a great deal of Magnificence. This Governor
General manages altogether the whole Trea&s;ury;
it is he that makes Peace and War, without being
obliged to Communicate with any Body, unle&s;s it
be with the King him&s;elf, if, by rea&s;on of his great
Age, he be not incapable of taking cogni&s;ance of
publick Affairs; He remains always &s;tanding in
the King's Pre&s;ence, permits not any of his Cour|tiers
or Guards to enter his Bed-Chamber, and ne|ver
&s;peaks to him, without laying his Hand up|on
his Mouth. He mu&s;t be very careful in not
neglecting the lea&s;t punctilio of the&s;e Ceremonies,
a fault of this nature not being to be repaired, un|le&s;s
with the lo&s;s of his Office, the King always
re&s;erving to him&s;elf the liberty of di&s;charging his
<PB N="103" REF="67">
primier Mini&s;ter from his place, when he plea&s;es,
which however is very rarely &s;een in tho&s;e parts,
where they act with a great deal of circum&s;pecti|on,
in a matter of &s;o great con&s;equence.</P>
<P>When the King of <HI>Cananor</HI> goes abroad, he is
either carried upon the Back of an Elephant,<NOTE PLACE="marg">How their Kings and Princes ap|pear in publick.</NOTE> or
el&s;e in a Palanquin, being Adorned with a Crown
of Ma&s;&s;ive Gold upon his Head, made not unlike
a Ducal Bonnet. This Crown weighs &s;omething
above 200 Guineas in Gold, and is always given
by the New Governor-General, immediately after
his Elevation to that Dignity, the Crown of the
la&s;t Decea&s;ed King being to be repo&s;ited in the
Trea&s;ury of the chief <HI>Pagod</HI> or <HI>Pagan</HI> Temple.
The King is &s;urrounded by his Guards compo&s;ed
out of the <HI>Nahers,</HI> under the &s;ound of Drums and
Trumpets, and other Warlike In&s;truments. Some
Officers of his Court march at &s;ome di&s;tance be|fore
the Guards, who&s;e Bu&s;ine&s;s is to make way,
and to cry the King is coming. All the Princes
if they go abroad by them&s;elves, as al&s;o the Prin|ce&s;&s;es
are &s;erved with the &s;ame Magnificence; If
the Governour or Chief Mini&s;ter of State be a
Prince, he goes abroad in the &s;ame Pomp, in re|&s;pect
of his high extraction, not of the dignity of
his Office. But if he be not of the Royal Fami|ly,
he is only attended by his Guards, without the

they wear their Hair, which is Black, ve|ry
long, and go Naked as far as the middle; even
the Princes them&s;elves, who, if they &s;ometimes
make u&s;e of a &s;mall Ve&s;t, always leave it open be|fore.
They wear about their Middle a piece of

and never make u&s;e of Shooes or Stockings.</P>
<P><PB N="107" REF="69">
In other Countries Ladies of Quality endeavour
to out-vie one another by their rich Gold and
Silver Stuffs; but the quite contrary is practi&s;ed
among the <HI>Malabars,</HI> where the&s;e Stuffs are not
worn but by the meaner &s;ort, the Ladies of the
<HI>Nahers</HI> and all the re&s;t of a Superiour Rank wear|ing
nothing but fine White Callico. The richer
&s;ort wear Girdles of Gold, and Bracelets of Silver
or Horn, in which, they take all mo&s;t particular
Pride. The Women never adorn them&s;elves with any
Jewels, unle&s;s it be a Ring. Both Men and Wo|men
have holes in their Ears, which are &s;o long,
that they hang down quite to their Shoulders;
becau&s;e they are &s;o careful in continually enlarg|ing
the holes, that you may thru&s;t a Fi&s;t into them,
which is occa&s;ioned by the weight of the Pendants,
who &s;ometimes exceed two Ounces; &s;ome of

marks of the King's favour, are never be|&s;tow'd
but upon &s;uch as have &s;ignalized them&s;elves

Shave their Beards clo&s;e, except &s;ome few, that
wear Mu&s;tachio's.</P>
<P>Their Hou&s;es are commonly made of Earth, and
in&s;tead of Tiles they cover them with the Leaves
of the <HI>Cocoe</HI>-Tree, it being a great rarity here to
&s;ee a Hou&s;e of Stone or Brick. Their Furniture
con&s;i&s;ts in &s;ome Baskets and a few Earthen Pots and
Di&s;hes; their Cups are of the &s;ame matter, and
their Kings them&s;elves make u&s;e of them as the
<HI>European</HI> Princes do of Gold and Silver Ve&s;&s;els.
They have no other Light at Nights, but what
their Lamps furni&s;h them with, which are &s;up|ply'd

As they are never &s;en&s;ible of Cold here, &s;o they

<P>THEIR <HI>Pagan</HI> Temples are mo&s;t Magnificent,
being generally covered with Copper, and
&s;ometimes with Silver. There is always a Ba&s;in
near the Temple, proportionable in bigne&s;s to the
largene&s;s of the Temple, where the <HI>Pagans</HI> purifie
them&s;elves before they approach their Idols. The
number of the <HI>Bramans</HI> is regulated according to
the Revenues belonging to the Temple. Every
day there is a certain quantity of Rice allotted for
the u&s;e of the Poor that live near it, as al&s;o for the
benefit of &s;uch Strangers as pa&s;s by that way, let
them be of what Religion they will; the <HI>Pagans</HI>
having only this Prerogative to enter within the
Temple, whereas, the others are obliged to remain
without Doors, under certain Barracks made for
that purpo&s;e, where they may Sleep, if Night
&s;urprize them in their Journey.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the ordinary Revenue of the&s;e <HI>Pagan</HI>
Temples, the people bring every day their Of|ferings,
<PB N="109" REF="70">
which are given to the <HI>Bramans,</HI> who are
to offer it to the Idols. And as the&s;e Offerings don't
con&s;i&s;t in any thing that has Life, &s;o they are mo&s;t
commonly Rice, Butter, Fruits, Pre&s;erves, Gold,
or Silver; the two la&s;t are but rarely offered, and
the re&s;t &s;erve the <HI>Bramans</HI> for the Maintenance of
their Families, they having no more to do than
to bring forth their empty Di&s;hes to the&s;e ignorant
people, who think it a Crime to believe otherwi&s;e,
than what they have offered to have been con&s;u|med
by the Idols.</P>
<P>Some of the riche&s;t Temples have large Terri|tories
belonging to them, from whence, they draw
their yearly Revenues; and if any one happen to
&s;pill Blood in the&s;e Grounds, tho' in his own de|fence,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Preroga|tive of their Sacred pla|ces.</NOTE>
and upon the mo&s;t Innocent occa&s;ion in the
World, the Crime is unpardonable, and he that
commits it is puni&s;h'd with Death, without the
lea&s;t re&s;pect to his Merits or Quality; nay, they
u&s;e &s;o much Rigour in this point, that if any one
&s;aves him&s;elf by flight, the next a-kin to him mu&s;t
pay for it with his Life, to expiate, as they &s;ay, the

<P>Of this I &s;aw an in&s;tance, during my &s;tay in the&s;e

Market-Town of <HI>Batiepatan,</HI> and &s;eeing a Rich Mer|chant,
who was a <HI>Mahometan,</HI> receive a con&s;idera|ble
Summ of Money in Ducats, took a re&s;olution
to lie in wait for him at a certain place, through
which he was to pa&s;s, to kill him, and &s;eize the
Money for their own u&s;e. Accordingly they fol|lowed
him at &s;ome di&s;tance, till they overtook him
at a certain place, which they believed to be be|yond
the Precinct of the Territories belonging to
the Temple of <HI>Batiepatan,</HI> where they run him
through in &s;everal places, till they had killed him,
and &s;o retired to <HI>Calicut,</HI> under the Juri&s;diction of
the King of <HI>Samorin.</HI> The Dead Carca&s;s of the
<HI>Mahometan</HI> Merchant having been &s;oon after found,
the <HI>Bramans</HI> were con&s;ulted, and being come to the
<PB N="110" REF="71">
place, they declared that he that had committed
the Murther, had defiled the Holy Ground of their
Idol, the place being within the Territories (which
are of a very large extent,) belonging to the Tem|ple.
Complaints being made hereof to Prince <HI>O|nitri,</HI>
he cau&s;ed an exact enquiry to be made af|ter
the Malefactor's Names and place of Abode,
who being two Brothers, they were Summon'd to
make their Appearance before the Prince, but be|ing
no where to be found, they were Condemn'd
to Death, as if they had been pre&s;ent; and to ex|piate
the Crime, an Unkle of theirs, &s;o far advan|ced
in Years, as not to be able to walk, without lean|ing
upon &s;ome Body, was carried before Prince <HI>O|nitri,</HI>
who examin'd him concerning the Fact and
the Flight of his Nephews; he an&s;wered, that he
was ignorant both of the cau&s;es and manner of the
Flight of his Nephews, but this availed but little;
for the Prince told him that he would give him
8 Days to find out his Nephews, and if in the mean
time he did not bring them forth, he &s;hould be
proceeded again&s;t as a Criminal. The poor Old
Man did what he could to &s;ave his Life, but in
vain, &s;o that the next day after the prefixed term
was expired, he was Condemn'd to Die, and not|with&s;tanding
his Old Age, his Innocence, and the

<P>BE&s;ides that the&s;e <HI>Pagans</HI> Wor&s;hip many Idols,
which have no re&s;emblance to any thing in the
World; there are &s;everal kinds of living Creatures,
whom they adore, but the mo&s;t profound re&s;pect
they pay to the Sun and Moon. As at the new
Moon, they make great rejoycings, &s;o when &s;he
is Eclip&s;ed, they appear abroad, making mo&s;t hor|rible
out-cries, whereby, as they &s;ay, they frighten
away the Dragon, who then endeavours to devour
the Moon. They u&s;e the &s;ame Veneration to their

old Age to &s;o high a Degree, that even the
mo&s;t Potent and Riche&s;t of the <HI>Nahers,</HI> will not &s;it
down before tho&s;e that are con&s;iderably older than
them&s;elves, though their Enemies.</P>
<P>They count their time by the Moon, notwith|&s;tanding
which, their Fe&s;tivals are not fixed to
certain days, this depending meerly on the Capri|cio
of the <HI>Bramans.</HI> The&s;e Prie&s;ts are very ex|act
in their Fa&s;ts, and upon any Solemn Day, they
call together &s;uch as live within a rea&s;onable di|&s;tance
of the <HI>Temple,</HI> from whence they bring forth
the Idol, and having placed it upon an Elephant
very righly Harna&s;&s;ed,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Pro|ce&s;&s;ions.</NOTE> they carry it about in tri|umph,
at the &s;ight of which, the People to &s;hew

the Ground. The Elephant is &s;urrounded by a
good number of the <HI>Nahers,</HI> who having each a
Fan tied to a long Cane in their hands, drive a|way
the Flies; which, as the Bramans &s;ay, would
el&s;e be trouble&s;ome to their Gods, but in effect, be|cau&s;e
<PB N="112" REF="72">
they would not incommode them&s;elves. Whil&s;t
the People make a confu&s;ed Noi&s;e with divers In|&s;truments,
and their joyful Acclamations, one of
the <HI>Bramans,</HI> with a two edged Cymetar in his
hand, having &s;ome &s;mall Bells hanging at the han|dle,
runs round about the Elephant, and after a
thou&s;and ridiculous and extravagant Po&s;tures, which
are look'd upon by the People as My&s;terious,
he wounds him&s;elf in the Head, offering his Blood
as a Sacrifice to the Idol, which is as little known

in each Kingdom there are maintained certain Aca|demies

People are trained up in their Exerci&s;e of Arms.
<PB N="113" REF="72">
The <HI>Indians</HI> are furni&s;hed with the materials for

<P>Their Mu&s;quets are very light, though they are
&s;ix foot long, and there is no <HI>Naher,</HI> but he always

that I have &s;een them frequently &s;hoot two
Arrows immediately one after another into the Air,
with &s;o much Dexterity, that the &s;econd hit the

<P>Their Bows are &s;ix foot long, their Arrows
three; the Iron at the point about three inches
broad, and eight long: They do not carry them
in a Quiver as they do at <HI>Suratte,</HI> where they are
not near &s;o big, but they hold always &s;even or
eight of them ready in their hands. Be&s;ides this,
they have fa&s;tned to their &s;ides with an iron Hook a
&s;ort of a large Knife or Bagonet, of about half a foot
broad, and a foot and a half long; this they make
u&s;e of when they come to a clo&s;e Engagement.
Tho&s;e who wear Cymetars make u&s;e of Bucklers;
all of them wear their Arms without Scabbards or
any other Coverts, for which rea&s;on they are very

only for this purpo&s;e, fight naked till by the death
of one party or the other, the quarrel be decided in
favour of the Conqueror, who very often does not
long &s;urvive the Victory.</P>
<P>The <HI>Malabars</HI> are generally very patient, and
not ea&s;ily put in a Pa&s;&s;ion; Be&s;ides which it ought

ways that po&s;&s;ibly can be, the u&s;e of poi|&s;on

out of a point of Honour, or at the mo&s;t for a lit|tle

which having &s;oon been granted by the

<P>The la&s;t of the&s;e two places is Situate at 11 De|grees,
and 40 Minutes North Latitude, in the
mo&s;t Fertile and Beautiful part of the whole King|dom.
Its Port is very fair and Commodious, du|ring
the Summer Sea&s;on, but dangerous in Winter.
It was in this place the <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> fir&s;t &s;ettled them|&s;elves
after their fir&s;t di&s;covery of the <HI>Indies.</HI> There
is to this day to be &s;een a &s;trong Tower Built of

from <HI>Portugal;</HI> it is environ'd with a very good
high Wall, whereupon are Mounted above 100
pieces of Cannon; they &s;oon after Built a very

&s;o con&s;iderable in tho&s;e parts, that they were
a Terror to all the <HI>Indians</HI> round about them. <HI>Ca|nanor</HI>
is de&s;titute of the conveniency of a River,
but this is &s;upplied by a &s;mall Bay, where there is
very Commodious Landing.</P>
<P>The <HI>Dutch</HI> having afterwards got a &s;ettlement
here under the protection of the King of <HI>Cananor,</HI>
the Inhabitants craved their a&s;&s;i&s;tance again&s;t the

<P>On the South &s;ide there is a very large Market-Town,
Inhabited by <HI>Mahometan</HI> Merchants, who
live there under the juri&s;diction of a per&s;on of Qua|lity
of their own Religion, who is neverthele&s;s de|pendant
from the King and his Chief Mini&s;ter.
He that was there Governour all my time, was called
<HI>Atitaja,</HI> and was King of &s;everal of the <HI>Maldive</HI>
I&s;lands.</P>
<P><PB N="119" REF="75">
The&s;e I&s;lands are very Healthful and Fertile,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Mal|dive</HI> I&s;lands.</NOTE>
where by rea&s;on of their great Traffick, you may

make u&s;e of neither Waggons, nor Coaches, but
in&s;tead of them u&s;e Elephants, Hor&s;es, and their Pa|lanquins.</P>
<P>'Tis here that tho&s;e <HI>Canas,</HI> which we call <HI>Bam|bou's,</HI>
grow in great quantities. They are when they
come to perfection, as thick as a Man's Thigh,
and 20 or 30 Foot long; whil&s;t they are very
young and tender they cut them and pickle them
in Vinegar. They &s;lit them before they are dry,
to make Palanquins of them, but when they are
come to full perfection, they are &s;old at the rate
of 200 Crowns apiece.</P>
<P>Since the departure of the <HI>Portugue&s;es</HI> from <HI>Ca|nanor,</HI>
the <HI>Dutch</HI> are become as grievous to the In|habitants
as the <HI>Portugue&s;e,</HI> and if their Pride was
in&s;upportable to the <HI>Indians,</HI> the in&s;olence of the
others is no le&s;s trouble&s;ome to them, &s;o that in all
likelihood they would be forward enough to lend
a helping hand, to &s;uch as would attempt to drive
the <HI>Hollanders</HI> from thence.</P>
<P>At a League di&s;tance from <HI>Cananor,</HI> as you Tra|vel
towards the South, you pa&s;s through a Town
called <HI>Carla,</HI> Inhabited by <HI>Tives</HI> and <HI>Cheti's,</HI> where
are made the be&s;t Callicoes, which retain the Name
of that place for their goodne&s;s &s;ake.</P>

a Hill, you &s;ee a Fort or Ca&s;tle belonging to the
King, where there is no Garri&s;on, tho' when the
Princes come that way, they always there take
up their Lodgings. There runs a very fair
River on one &s;ide of the <HI>Ba&s;ar,</HI> or Market-Place,
which falls into the Sea not above 100 Paces
below it. This River is very broad, but &s;o &s;hal|low,
that a Ship of above 100 Tuns cannot enter
it without great hazard. At its Entrance, (at a
<PB N="120" REF="76">
League's di&s;tance from the Shoar,) are abundance
of Rocks, and a &s;mall I&s;land without any Inhabi|tants,
where there is however very good Hunting;
be&s;ides which, it &s;erves very often for a &s;helter to
&s;uch Ve&s;&s;els as in Tempe&s;tuous Weather cannot
make the River; there are no Cor&s;airs at <HI>Trema|patan,</HI>
but tho&s;e who Crui&s;e this way from the
Neighbouring Coa&s;ts, frequently lie perdue under this
I&s;land, and wait for &s;uch &s;hips as they intend to

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Our departure from Tilcery.</HEAD>
<P>ACcordingly we &s;et out from <HI>Tilcery,</HI> about the
middle of <HI>June,</HI> being conducted by &s;ome
Guides, and guarded by &s;everal <HI>Nahers.</HI> Our whole
Equipage con&s;i&s;ted in no more than a Shirt and a
pair of Drawers; on our Feet we wore a kind of
Sandals, and to keep off the Rain, we were each of
us provided with an Umbrello, made out of the
leaves of Palm-trees.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t days Journey proved extreamly trouble|&s;ome,
being obliged to march all day long through
the Waters that had over flown the Roads, which
in &s;ome places came to our middle, &s;o that we were
not able to travel above two Leagues the whole day;
at Night we took up our Lodgings which were &s;or|ry
enough, in a &s;mall Market-Town, where we
dryed our Cloths without much difficulty, they be|ing
all of Callicoe. Thus after a mi&s;erable Nights
Lodging, we continued our Journey the next Morn|ing,
when we were refre&s;hed with a &s;mall interval
of fair Weather, which however la&s;ted but a few
hours. As we were marching through the Waters,
we were extreamly pe&s;tered with Hor&s;e Leaches,
which fa&s;tned them&s;elves in great numbers to our
Legs, and fatigued us to that degree, that being
quite &s;pent by Noon, we were forced to take up our
Quarters at the Habitations of &s;ome Mahometans.
In the afternoon the Sieur <HI>de Flacour</HI> paid a vi&s;ite to
the <HI>Naher,</HI> who though a Subject of the King of
<HI>Cananor,</HI> was Lord of the place, and without
who&s;e con&s;ent we could not pa&s;s, which we ea&s;ily
obtained by the means of a pre&s;ent. The next day
<PB N="131" REF="81">
we found the Road &s;ome-what better than we had
done hitherto, but another misfortune abated much
of our &s;atisfaction; for after we had travelled near
four hours, we found our &s;elves, being mi&s;led by
the ignorance of our Guides, near the &s;ame place
from whence we &s;et out in the Morning. An un|&s;ea&s;onable
anger would have &s;tood us but in little
&s;tead with tho&s;e, who had us at their Mercy, and
in whom we were obliged to confide as our Con|ductors,
&s;o that patience was the be&s;t remedy we
could pre&s;cribe our &s;elves, and thus we continued
our Journey in hopes of better luck. But we found
our &s;elves &s;oon deceived in our expectation, for we
had not travelled far, when the Rains began to be
more violent than ever, be&s;ides that we travelled
all over &s;tony Grounds full of deep and large
Ditches, which we were forced to pa&s;s over &s;mall
Planks or pieces of Trees laid a cro&s;s. Armed with
Patience, and an un&s;haken Re&s;olution to overcome all
Ob&s;tacles, we at la&s;t came to a Market-Town, in|habited
by Mahometans, &s;ituated near a River
which runs by <HI>Cognaly.</HI> We were kindly received
by the Inhabitants, and the great Rains and pa&s;s'd
fatigues, obliged us to re&s;t there for one day.</P>
<P>But, what we had &s;uffered hitherto, was all it
&s;eems nothing in compari&s;on of what we were like|ly
to undergoe for the future; the Dangers and Fa|tigues
which were repre&s;ented to us by the&s;e Ma|hometans,
made &s;o lively an impre&s;&s;ion upon me,
that I earne&s;tly reque&s;ted the Sieur <HI>de Flacour</HI> not to
go further, and though every one there pre&s;ent was
of my Opinion, and gave him&s;elf fre&s;h a&s;&s;urances of
the dangers and troubles he mu&s;t undergo, he &s;tood
firm in his re&s;olution, to pro&s;ecute his Journey, in
order to di&s;patch his bu&s;ine&s;s before the return of the
Sieur <HI>de Caron.</HI></P>
<P>As for my part, I being not under any further
obligation, than to bear the Sieur <HI>de Flacour</HI> Com|pany,
I thought it ra&s;hne&s;s to expo&s;e my life to dan|ger
without any pro&s;pect of doing good; &s;o that I
re&s;olved to quit the Sieur <HI>de Flacour,</HI> and to take the
<PB N="132" REF="82">
conveniency of a &s;mall River, which di&s;charges it
&s;elf not far from hence into the Sea.</P>
<P>According to this re&s;olution, I hired a <HI>Canoe</HI> or
Boat, refu&s;ing to accept of the Fire-arms that were
offered me, becau&s;e I did not imagine I &s;hould have
any occa&s;ion for them, being in hopes to reach and
lodge that Night at <HI>Bargara,</HI> in the Hou&s;e of <HI>Couleas
Marcal,</HI> a rich Mahometan Merchant, and famous
Pirate in tho&s;e parts, with whom I had &s;ome Bu&s;i|ne&s;s.
I pa&s;&s;ed without any hindrance, (having
only the Ma&s;ter and his Boy in my Company) by
<HI>Cotta</HI> or <HI>Cognaly,</HI> a Market-Town, from whence
the mo&s;t famous Pirate in tho&s;e Seas, who&s;e Lord|&s;hip
it is, derives his Name; and thus being gently
conveyed by the current, I thought my &s;elf out of
all danger, as being near <HI>Bargara,</HI> when &s;ome Pirates
who had di&s;covered me from far of, were making
towards me with their Boat. As I was not igno|rant,
that all what the&s;e Barbarians lay hold on up|on
the Water, they look upon as their own; we
made the be&s;t of our way to the &s;hoar, but &s;carce
had we reach'd the Bank, when we perceived the
Pirates at the heels of us, which &s;o terrified both
the Ma&s;ter of the Boat, and his Boy, who carried
my Portmantle, that they look'd for their &s;afety in
the &s;witne&s;s of their heels, leaving me to the mer|cy
of tho&s;e Robbers, who pur&s;ued me clo&s;ely, till
they overtook me. I now began to repent my &s;elf
of having refu&s;ed the fire-locks that were offered me,
one of which would have been a &s;ufficient defence
again&s;t a couple of cowardly Rovers, who had no
other Arms,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Author taken by a <HI>Malabar</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word">.</NOTE> but their Lances. Finding me with|out
any Arms, they &s;oon knock'd me down, and
&s;eeing there were no Witne&s;s of the violence offer|ed
to me by Land, they forc'd me into their Boat,
and carried me back to <HI>Cognaly.</HI> As I was the fir&s;t
of our Nation who had the misfortune to fall into
their hands, &s;o I was conducted before their Chief|tain,
who u&s;ed his utmo&s;t endeavours to extort from
me a Summ of Money for my Ran&s;om; but having
an&s;wered him that I had none to give, he asked me
<PB N="133" REF="82">
for what rea&s;on I had quitted the Sieur <HI>de Flacour,</HI>
and whether in his return he was to pa&s;s that way
through his Lord&s;hip; I told him, that I was not
able to give him an account, upon which he or|dered
the Irons to be brought in, which were laid
clo&s;e by me, &s;o that I expected every moment to
be loaden with Irons.</P>
<P>But as good fortune would have it, this Chieftain
had heard &s;omething of the late alliance concluded
betwixt us and the King of <HI>Samorin,</HI> who&s;e Subject
he was, which con&s;ideration together with the ut|mo&s;t
&s;everity, u&s;ed again&s;t &s;uch as commit Robbe|ries
on Land, or in a River, had &s;o good an effect
upon him, that he ordered the Irons to be taken a|way,
and when I expected it lea&s;t, turned the civi|le&s;t
man in the World, offering me his Hou&s;e and
every thing el&s;e for my conveniency.</P>
<P>But as I was eager to &s;ee my &s;elf at Liberty,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word"> at li|berty.</NOTE> &s;o I
returned him thanks for his offers, de&s;iring him to
give me leave to go &s;treight to <HI>Bargara,</HI> pretending
that I had bu&s;ine&s;s of great moment to tran&s;act
there that Night. He having granted my reque&s;t,
and ordered a Ve&s;&s;el to be got ready, he pre&s;ented
me in the mean while with &s;ome &s;weet Meats&punc; of
which I took a few for Decency's &s;ake, but did not
eat any of them for fear of Poi&s;on, though at
the &s;ame time it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, that Poi&s;on is
le&s;s known among the <HI>Malabars,</HI> than any other
Nation.</P>
<P>After I had taken my leave of the Pirate, I en|tred
the Ve&s;&s;el which was to carry me to <HI>Bargara,</HI>
where I was no &s;ooner arrived, but I met with the
&s;ame <HI>Canoe,</HI> which had left me before in the lurch,
the Ma&s;ter pretending that he had &s;tay'd for me
there in hopes of my coming. But what rejoyced
me mo&s;t was, That a certain Fi&s;herman told me,
that there was very lately a <HI>Frenchman</HI> arrived in
this Market-Town. You may imagine, that I made
all the ha&s;t I could to find him out, and meeting
with my old Friend the Sieur <HI>de la Serine</HI> the Elder,
who was lately returned from <HI>Calicut,</HI> this happy
<PB N="134" REF="83">
meeting was no &s;mall comfort to me, for what I had
&s;uffered during this trouble&s;ome Journey, of which
and the la&s;t adventure, I gave him an exact relation.</P>
<P>He having already &s;ettled matters with the Cor|&s;air
who is Lord of <HI>Bargara,</HI> we travelled the next
day together to <HI>Tilcery,</HI> which being not above three
Leagues from thence, we arrived there before
Noon. There was &s;carce any body but was &s;ur|prized
at my &s;udden return, but at the &s;ame time,
approved of my Re&s;olution, of not expo&s;ing my
&s;elf to the hazards of &s;o dangerous a Journey, with|out
an ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of Tanor.</HEAD>
<P><HI>TAnor</HI> is the principal Town of a petty Kingdom,
which has given it its Name; it is 5 Leagues
di&s;tant to the South from <HI>Calicut.</HI> It wants the con|veniency
of a River, the Ships that are bound to
this place being obliged to ride in the Road where
there is tolerable good riding, but only in the Sum|mer.
The Inhabitants of the place are <HI>Mahometan</HI>
Merchants, who, mo&s;t of them are very Rich.
On the very Sea &s;ide there are two &s;mall Towns
Inhabited by Fi&s;her-Men, whereof tho&s;e of one
are <HI>Chri&s;tians,</HI> tho&s;e of the other <HI>Pagans.</HI> Near the
fir&s;t of the&s;e two you &s;ee a &s;mall Church &s;tanding
<PB N="144" REF="88">
in a Church-Yard, where &s;tands a very high Cro&s;s.
The King of <HI>Tanor</HI> keeps his Court at about a
League's di&s;tance from thence, his <HI>Mahometan</HI> and
<HI>Pagan</HI> Subjects living under the Juri&s;diction of a
Governour of his, who has not the lea&s;t Authority
over the <HI>Chri&s;tians,</HI> who are under the Government
of him that has the over&s;ight over the abovementi|oned
Church, which has long &s;ince been in the po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion
of the Je&s;uits, who from time to time &s;end
hither their Mi&s;&s;ionaries, to labour in the Conver&s;i|on
of the&s;e Idolatrous people to the Chri&s;tian Faith.
He that was there at the time when I pa&s;&s;ed that
way, was called <HI>Matthias Fernandez,</HI> who having
lived there for the&s;e 7 or 8 Years together, is per|fectly
well ver&s;ed in the Language of the Country.</P>
<P>Tho' the whole Kingdom of <HI>Tanor</HI> be not above
8 or 10 Leagues long, and as many broad, yet is
their King as Ab&s;olute as any in <HI>Malabar,</HI> not being
Tributary to any other. He has always kept a very

with him.<NOTE PLACE="marg">King of <HI>Tanor</HI> is an Enemy to the <HI>Dutch.</HI></NOTE> The differences which were
then betwixt us and the <HI>Hollanders,</HI> being ri&s;en to
that pitch, that we expected nothing el&s;e but to
come quickly to an open Rupture, and this Prince
having always been a Mortal Enemy of the <HI>Dutch,</HI>
we endeavour'd by all means po&s;&s;ible to gain his

bearing Ships of 100 Tuns Burthen, but is &s;o

<P>A Nephew of our Ho&s;t much Beloved by him,

of all the Remedies that were u&s;ed by his Unkle,
(who had left nothing unattempted which might
conduce to the Recovery of his Health,) was by
the violence of his Di&s;temper reduced to that Con|dition,
that his Life was de&s;paired of. All other

to the My&s;terious Super&s;tition of his Reli|gion,
and having &s;ent for the <HI>Bramans</HI> belonging
to the next Temple, to try their Skill with the
Patient, they &s;ent one of their Number, who began
the Ceremony with crying &s;ilence to the Compa|ny.</P>
<P><PB N="146" REF="89">
After this he ordered a large Wooden Bowl to be
brought to him, which was laid all over the bot|tom
with Leaves; into this he put &s;ome fre&s;h <HI>Co|coes,</HI>
&s;ome dry'd, &s;ome <HI>Bananas,</HI> &s;ome <HI>Jagre,</HI> or

Palm-tree Wine. The <HI>Braman</HI> put in every thing
with his own hand, muttering out certain Words,
and making mo&s;t extravagant and ridiculous Po|&s;tures.
Round the great Bowl he &s;tuck many Wax
Candles lighted, and betwixt each of them a &s;tick
of the &s;ame thickne&s;s tied all round about with Flow|ers.
Then the <HI>Braman</HI> fell to his Prayers, which
being ended, he called to one of the Standers by,
who gave him one of the lighted Wax Candles,
which he put in his Mouth. This was no &s;ooner
done, but he appeared to be all in a Rapture, ma|king
mo&s;t &s;trange Po&s;tures and Faces, this being the
very nick of time, when they believe him to be in|&s;pired,
and look upon what he pronounces, as O|racles,
whether the Patient be to live or die. How|ever
it was, this Devil happened to be none of the

&s;hould recover his Health, which proved quite con|trary,

The <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Factory of <HI>Batiepatan,</HI> is above

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the Inhabitants of Goa.</HEAD>
<P>THE Inhabitants of <HI>Goa</HI> may conveniently be

true <HI>Portugue&s;es,</HI> whom they call <HI>Reinots;</HI> the &s;e|cond
are the <HI>Me&s;tices,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Several &s;orts of In|habitants in <HI>Goa.</HI></NOTE> begotten betwixt a <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI>
and an <HI>Indian</HI> Woman, or a <HI>Negroe,</HI> the la&s;t of
the&s;e too much exceed the others in number. There
are be&s;ides this abundance of <HI>Indians,</HI> who having
Abandon'd their Super&s;titious Idolatry, are turn'd
<HI>Roman Catholicks.</HI> The Slaves they call <HI>Cafres,</HI>
who are mo&s;t <HI>Indians.</HI> There are al&s;o at <HI>Goa</HI> &s;ome
<HI>Mahometans</HI> and <HI>Banyans,</HI> who are tolerated by the
<HI>Portugue&s;es,</HI> by rea&s;on of the advantages they re|ceive
from them, by way of Commerce. They
enjoy the &s;ame Freedom with the re&s;t, but are
not permitted to make publick profe&s;&s;ion of their
Religion, which if they do, they are put under
the Inqui&s;ition, and are treated like Chri&s;tian Apo|&s;tates.</P>
<P>Per&s;ons of Quality are carried in <HI>Palanquins</HI> by
their Slaves, and &s;eldom are &s;een on Hor&s;e-back,
<PB N="164" REF="98">
unle&s;s it be upon extraordinary occa&s;ions, as to
Conduct the Vice-Roy into the Country, or to a&s;|&s;i&s;t
at the running of the Ring, or Bull-fight|ings.</P>
<P>The Slaves at <HI>Goa</HI> not wanting conveniency to
De&s;ert their Ma&s;ters,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Slaves at <HI>Goa.</HI></NOTE> and to &s;helter them&s;elves in
the Adjacent Provinces, where they are out of
their reach, makes them not to be treated &s;o har&s;h|ly
as in &s;ome other parts, which makes the&s;e <HI>Bar|barians</HI>
very unruly and in&s;olent. They frequent|ly
Rob on the High-ways, and tho' they are not
permitted to wear any thing el&s;e about them but
a Cane, yet they commonly knock Pa&s;&s;engers on
the Head before they Rob them.</P>
<P>A certain Gentleman coming one day alone
from his Country-Hou&s;e, near <HI>Goa,</HI> was &s;et upon
by one of the&s;e <HI>Negroe</HI> Slaves, who threatned to
knock his Brains out if he did not immediately &s;ur|render
his Money and Cloaths. The <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI>
had a Sword and Dagger by his &s;ide, but the other
having &s;urprized him unawares, and holding up
his Cane ready to &s;trike if he made the lea&s;t moti|on,
he found him&s;elf not in a condition to put
him&s;elf in a po&s;ture of defence, without mo&s;t im|minent
danger of being killed. And finding no
other remedy than to &s;urrender, he cunningly, but
in a carele&s;s manner, let drop &s;ome of his Money,
and whil&s;t the Slave was bu&s;ie in taking it up,
took this opportunity to draw his Dagger where|with
he di&s;patched him pre&s;ently.</P>
<P>It would be &s;uperfluous to enlarge here upon the
Manners and Cu&s;toms of the <HI>Portugue&s;es,</HI> they be|ing
too well known in the&s;e parts to de&s;erve a parti|cular
De&s;cription. There are very few but what are
&s;ufficiently &s;en&s;ible that the <HI>Portugue&s;es</HI> in general
have the&s;e three Qualities belonging to them:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Genius of the <HI>Portu|gue&s;es.</HI></NOTE> To
be Zealous to the highe&s;t degree of Super&s;tition; to
be Amorous to a degree of Madne&s;s, and Jealous
beyond all rea&s;on. Neither will it appear &s;trange,
if the Ladies of <HI>Goa</HI> are as tractable and obliging
to hand&s;ome Men, as tho&s;e of <HI>Lisbon.</HI> 'Tis true,
<PB N="165" REF="98">

done, but they &s;eldom want wit to deceive their
Keepers, when they are re&s;olved to ta&s;te of the for|bidden

Creatures in the World, if they happen to be di&s;|appointed
in their Expectation.</P>

concerning their <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> Company. Her Heart
being ea&s;ily &s;u&s;ceptible of Love, the very fir&s;t &s;ight
of this Stranger, had made &s;o lively an impre&s;&s;ion
upon it, that &s;he could not re&s;t &s;atisfied till &s;he had
&s;ent one of her Female Slaves, (no novice in the
procuring Trade,) to de&s;ire the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Man to
give her a vi&s;it; the Slave &s;ufficiently acquitted her
&s;elf of her Charge, telling the Young Gentleman,
that he had the be&s;t opportunity in the World,
of taking his Satisfaction, her Lady's Husband be|ing
abroad, &s;o that the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Man overcome by
her intreaties and per&s;wa&s;ions, promi&s;ed to come
at the appointed time, at which &s;he being over|joyed
returned to her Mi&s;tre&s;s to bring her the
welcome News that her Gallant would certainly
be with her according to her appointment.</P>
<P>The Lady being one of tho&s;e that cannot bear
delays without much impatience, made the poor
Slave &s;tand Sentry two Hours before the appoin|ted

to her Apartment. But whether it was that the
<HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Man dreading the Jealou&s;ie of the <HI>Portu|gue&s;es,</HI>
did not think it worth his while to venture
his Life for a chance bit, or that &s;ome other rea|&s;on
hindred him, he did not make his per&s;onal ap|pearance,
according to his promi&s;e; &s;o that the
poor Slave after &s;he had kept her po&s;t till Mid|night,
return'd di&s;con&s;olate to her Mi&s;tre&s;s, who
being put beyond all Patience, by rea&s;on of her
di&s;appointment, revenged her &s;elf upon the Slave,
<PB N="166" REF="99">
who&s;e Back paid for all; and &s;he would certain|ly
have felt the mo&s;t direful effects of her fury,
if &s;he had not promi&s;ed &s;he would go the next
Morning to find out the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Man, to upbraid
him with the breach of his Word, and not to
leave him till &s;he had engaged him to comply with
her de&s;ires.</P>
<P>The <HI>Negroe</HI> Slave as it happened had the good
Fortune to meet with the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Man, unto whom,
&s;he related in a mo&s;t ample manner how &s;he had
been treated by her Mi&s;tre&s;s, occa&s;ioned by his
neglect or breach of Word, mo&s;t earne&s;tly intrea|ting
him only to afford her Mi&s;tre&s;s the favour of
one vi&s;it, without which, &s;he would be in danger
of being torn to pieces by this pa&s;&s;ionate body.
He promi&s;ed, out of Complai&s;ance, to come
very &s;hortly to pay her a vi&s;it, but perform'd his
promi&s;e no better than the fir&s;t time, being obliged
to leave <HI>Goa</HI> in a few days after.</P>

a place Situate about 8 Leagues to the

forced them with our Swords in hand to row to

<P>No &s;ooner were we got a-&s;hoar, but we were
informed that the &s;ame Cor&s;airs had ju&s;t before ta|ken

valued at 2000 <HI>l.</HI> Sterling, which they ha|ving

being <HI>Mahometans,</HI> except only three <HI>French</HI> Men,
we were very unea&s;ie about our Ship, for fear it
&s;hould fall into the Hands of the&s;e Cor&s;airs. Mr.

than all the re&s;t, he having left his Ship to go a|&s;hoar
in a place where he had no concerns on the
account of the Company; and to add to our af|fliction,
the Wind being quite contrary, we could
not get back again to the Ship.</P>

<P>This <HI>Rhodomontado</HI> &s;ucceeded beyond expectati|on;

our Ship to be in a readine&s;s to &s;et &s;ail, they were
&s;o frightned thereat, that they &s;et up all the &s;ail

<P>About the beginning of <HI>October,</HI> the Sieur <HI>Fer|manel</HI>
who was Captain of the Ship called the St.
<HI>James,</HI> received orders to get every thing ready for his
departure, and I being commanded to go on board
the &s;ame Ship, we departed from <HI>Suratte</HI> without
knowing whither we were bound, our orders being
&s;ealed up and not to be opened till we were twenty
Leagues at Sea of off <HI>Suratte.</HI></P>
<P>It was our Opinion, that the <HI>French</HI> Directors
having received &s;ecret intelligence, that we were
come to a rupture with <HI>Holland,</HI> and knowing our

her in her return to <HI>Suratte.</HI></P>
<P>The orders being opened at the appointed place,
we found our &s;elves to have been pretty near the

all &s;uch Ships as we met, that were weaker than
we, and to take all the <HI>Dutch</HI> Ships we could.</P>
<P><PB N="175" REF="103">
The Winds proved very changeable, notwith|&s;tanding

We came within &s;ight of the Cape of <HI>Ra&s;al|gate,</HI>
&s;ituate on the South-&s;ide of the entrance into
the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Gulph, and after we had doubled the

for its mo&s;t advantageous Situation.</P>
<P>Here it was that the <HI>Portugue&s;es</HI> had formerly a
&s;trong Fort, which being judged impregnable,
made them Ma&s;ters of the whole <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Gulph;
this &s;o advantageous place the <HI>Portugue&s;es</HI> lo&s;t by the
avariciou&s;ne&s;s of him who commanded in the Fort,
who having &s;old the Provi&s;ions laid up for the u&s;e
of the Garri&s;on, to the <HI>Arabians</HI> at an exce&s;&s;ive price,
in hopes of receiving fre&s;h &s;upplies in a little time;
the King of the Country took hold of this oppor|tunity,
&s;treightly Be&s;ieged the place, and forced the
<HI>Portugue&s;es</HI> to &s;urrender at Di&s;cretion. The <HI>Portu|gue&s;es</HI>
remain ever &s;ince at Enmity with the&s;e <HI>Arabi|ans,</HI>
but have hitherto not been able to recover the
Fort.</P>
<P>From hence we coa&s;ted it along to the Cape of
<HI>Mo&s;andan,</HI> where the Gulph begins to be &s;o &s;traight,
that the Land appears on both &s;ides. Not far from
this Cape we di&s;covered a Ve&s;&s;el, after which, pur|&s;uant
to our orders, we made all the &s;ail we could
to come up with her. But finding that &s;he avoid|ed

put up our Flag, when the Captain came on board

which if it had happened, we mu&s;t have infallibly

<P>No &s;ooner did day appear, but we left this dan|gerous

<P><HI>BAudar Aba&s;ty</HI> is a City belonging to the King

and is Situate under the twenty &s;eventh degree
of North Latitude; it is one of the large&s;t and be&s;t
peopled Cities in tho&s;e parts, where there is always
a great concour&s;e of Merchants, as well <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> as
Foreigners Mo&s;t of the <HI>Indian</HI> Ships touch in this

Commodities as are con&s;umed in <HI>Per&s;ia;</HI> their
Hou&s;es are built two Stories high, being flat and
Tarra&s;&s;ed on the top with Summer Hou&s;es, the
better to enjoy the benefit of the fre&s;h Air. The
Streets are here very narrow, and their Market-places
not extraordinary large. People of Quality
divert them&s;elves in their Country Hou&s;es built a|mong
the Mountains, from <HI>April</HI> to <HI>September,</HI> du|ring
which time, few others but Merchants, and
<PB N="177" REF="104">
tho&s;e depending on them, are to be &s;een in the
City.</P>
<P>The Situation of this place is &s;uch, as to contri|bute
not a little to the inconveniencies occa&s;ioned
by the exce&s;&s;ive heats. For ju&s;t without the Walls
of the City, to the Ea&s;t, there are &s;everal high
Rocky Hills, from whence the burning rage of the
Sun reflecting upon the City and the Port,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Its Situati|on.</NOTE> makes
the heats almo&s;t in&s;upportable. Be&s;ides which, the
hot South Winds lay &s;o continually upon the Port,
which choaks up the Foreign Mariners not u&s;ed to
the Climate, abundance of whom die very &s;ud|denly.</P>
<P>Upon the&s;e Hills there are va&s;t quantities of the
Ro&s;es, we call Ro&s;es of <HI>Jericho,</HI> which open as &s;oon
as they are put in Water, and &s;hut again as &s;oon as
taken out. The Mountains of <HI>Arabia</HI> lie on the o|ther
&s;ide of the Gulph, which is not above eight
Leagues broad hereabouts.</P>
<P>There is not one fountain in this great City;
&s;ome Wells they have, but the Water is bracki&s;h:
So that they fetch all their fre&s;h Water at a Leagues
di&s;tance from the Town. They have a certain kind
of Earthen Ve&s;&s;els, in which they keep their Wa|ter
as cool as if it had been lately drawn from the
Spring.</P>
<P>The Ground about <HI>Baudar Aba&s;ty</HI> is very Sandy,
and con&s;equently not very fruitful, but &s;ome
Leagues from thence, there grows mo&s;t excellent
Wine, which they call <HI>Chiras</HI> Wine. They u&s;e
al&s;o another &s;ort of White Wine, which is made
in the I&s;le of <HI>Quichemiche,</HI> where the Grapes are
without Stones.</P>
<P>Several of the <HI>European</HI> Nations have their Fa|ctories
at <HI>Gameron,</HI> this City being a free Port for
all Foreigners to Trade in.</P>
<P>The <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> are all Mahometans, and &s;o is their
Prince, but as there are abundance of Pagans al&s;o
in <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> they allow them the free Exerci&s;e of their
Religion in their Temples, and their publick Bath|ing
places. I met near this place with &s;ome of the&s;e
<PB N="178" REF="105">
Trees, of which I have &s;poken before, to wit,
that they turn their Branches down-ward, and when
they touch the Ground, they take root immediate|ly:
I &s;aw here one of this kind, under which 6000
Men might have been placed with good conveni|ency.
I al&s;o met with a Pagan, who&s;e hair was a|bove
fifteen foot long, he was one of that Sect they
call <HI>Faquirs.</HI></P>
<P>I mu&s;t confe&s;s, I did not &s;tay long enough at <HI>Ga|meron,</HI>
to make particular ob&s;ervations concerning
all their Manners and Cu&s;toms; but thus much I
took notice of,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Inhabitants of <HI>Game|ron.</HI></NOTE> That the Men are generally very

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Concerning our &s;tay at Daman.</HEAD>
<P>NOT long before my Arrival at <HI>Daman,</HI> the
Sieur <HI>de St. James,</HI> Son of a <HI>French</HI> Phy&s;ician,
and another young <HI>French</HI> Man, were Married
there. The la&s;t of the&s;e two had Married the Ba|&s;tard
Si&s;ter of a Lady of Quality, called <HI>Donna Pe|tronilla
de la Cerda,</HI> who, after &s;he was a Widow,
had Married a per&s;on of the fir&s;t Rank among the
<HI>Portugue&s;es.</HI> The Sieur <HI>de St. James</HI> had Married
the Daughter of this Lady, who&s;e Name being <HI>Don|na
Ro&s;a de Mello,</HI> was in all re&s;pects an&s;werable to
her Youth and Beauty.</P>
<P>I having heard much talk of them at <HI>Suratte,</HI>
I thought my &s;elf under an indi&s;pen&s;ible obligati|on
to pay them a vi&s;it. But the fir&s;t thing I did
was to deliver my recommendation to the Rector
of the Je&s;uit College, who receiv'd me with all
the Civility imaginable, and conducted me to the
Governour, who after he had treated me according
to his Quality, propo&s;ed to me to &s;tay at <HI>Daman,</HI>
where there was at that time no other Phy&s;ician,
but &s;ome <HI>Pagan Indians,</HI> who&s;e Practice con&s;i&s;ting
only in a few Receipts, they apply them indiffe|rently
to all Patients. I return'd his Compliment,
de&s;iring &s;ome time to con&s;ider of the matter; and
the Rector of the Je&s;uits ob&s;erving my inclination
to Travelling to be more prevailing with me than
the Pro&s;pect of pre&s;ent advantages, urged me to
accept of the Governour's offers, a&s;&s;uring me, that
he would make u&s;e of all his intere&s;ts for my fur|ther
advantage.</P>
<P>The next following day I paid a vi&s;it to my
two Country-Men, of whom I &s;poke ju&s;t now,
<PB N="186" REF="109">
they were overjoyed to &s;ee me, and Treated me
with a mo&s;t Magnificent Collation; in the mean
while, the Sieur <HI>de St. James</HI> had &s;poke in my be|half,
to his Mother-in-law, to de&s;ire her permi&s;&s;i|on
to let me Lodge in their Hou&s;e, which &s;he ha|ving
ea&s;ily granted, they had without my know|ledge
&s;ent for my Trunks, &s;o that when after &s;ome
Hours &s;tay, I was going to take my leave, they
intreated me to accept of their Hou&s;e, which at
their reiterated intreaties I could not refu&s;e to my
two generous Country-Men.</P>
<P>I was not ignorant of the Cu&s;tom of the <HI>Portu|gue&s;es,</HI>
with whom you can &s;carce meet with &s;uffici|ent
circum&s;pection, in re&s;pect of the fair Sex, I
did not as yet mention one word concerning their
Ladies; but the next day they were the fir&s;t that
mentioned and propo&s;ed a vi&s;it to them; I &s;eem'd
to be carele&s;s in the matter, and having &s;pent the
greate&s;t part of the day in vi&s;iting &s;ome of my
Patients in the City, at my return towards Night,
they introduced me to them in their Apartments,
where I entertained them with the &s;ame freedom
as we do in <HI>France,</HI> whereat they &s;eem'd not at
all di&s;plea&s;ed. They did ask me many Que&s;tions,
which I an&s;wered as well as I could, and <HI>Donna Pe|tronilla</HI>
Addre&s;&s;ing her Di&s;cour&s;e to me, above the
re&s;t, we did not part till late at Night.</P>
<P>I did not fail afterwards to vi&s;it them at lea&s;t
once a day, and <HI>Petronilla</HI> treated me always with
more than ordinary Civility. She was of about
39 years of Age, notwith&s;tanding which, &s;he had
&s;ufficient Charms, being of a very plea&s;ing A&s;pect,
of an admirable Shape, delicately featured and a|greeable
in all re&s;pects; &s;he had a very lively Eye,
and her Humour was the &s;weete&s;t and mo&s;t Com|plai&s;ant
in the World. We diverted our &s;elves to|gether
for &s;ome Hours every Night, and I mu&s;t con|fe&s;s

<P><HI>DOnna Petronilla's</HI> Seat was at <HI>Trapor,</HI> &s;he being

Home, being not above 10 Leagues from <HI>Daman.</HI>
Having fir&s;t asked the Governour's Leave, I ac|cepted
of their kind offer, and Travelled with
their whole Family towards <HI>Trapor.</HI> On the <HI>Mon|day</HI>
of the Holy Week we laid at a place called
<HI>Danou,</HI> a Lord&s;hip belonging to the Elde&s;t Son of
<HI>Donna Petronilla;</HI> near to this is the Mountain
called the <HI>Picque</HI> of <HI>Danou,</HI> re&s;embling in &s;hape a

&s;erves for a guide to the Ships that Sail near

no Ships of any Burthen but only &s;ome &s;mall

<P><HI>Donna Petronilla's</HI> Husband met us at <HI>Danou,</HI> and
received me with all imaginable Civility, and
the <HI>Wedne&s;day</HI> following we came to <HI>Trapor</HI> or <HI>Ta|rapour.</HI></P>
<P>This is a &s;mall City Built on the Sea &s;ide, half
ways betwixt <HI>Daman</HI> and <HI>Ba&s;&s;aim,</HI> belonging to
the <HI>Portugue&s;es,</HI> who have here a Deputy Gover|nour,
depending on the Governour of <HI>Daman.</HI>
The Inhabitants here are very Rich, tho' the Ri|ver
be &s;o &s;hallow as not to be Navigable, unle&s;s by
&s;mall Ships. There is but one Pari&s;h Church,
one Chapel belonging to the Charitable Society,
and a Church belonging to the <HI>Jacobin-Friars.</HI> On
the <HI>Friday</HI> in the Afternoon we heard a Sermon of
<PB N="188" REF="110">
the Pa&s;&s;ion of Chri&s;t, and the Prie&s;t made many
pau&s;es, the more pa&s;&s;ionately, as I &s;uppo&s;e, to re|pre&s;ent
the My&s;tery of the matter he was treating
of. The Women &s;it in a Gallery by them&s;elves
at Church, and have Curtains drawn before them,
to avoid their being &s;een by the Men; but if
they are not &s;een they make them&s;elves to be un|der&s;tood
by their knocking their Brea&s;ts, by their
Sighs and Groans, which they &s;end forth as often
as the Prie&s;t &s;ays any thing that moves Compa&s;&s;ion.
Neverthele&s;s, there are many among them, who
make but ill u&s;e of this Holy-day, and under the
cloak of this affected Zeal, carry on their Intrigues.</P>
<P>After Sermon we &s;aw the Proce&s;&s;ion,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Proce&s;&s;ion at <HI>Trapor.</HI></NOTE> which was
preceded by &s;everal Penitents, who having their
Faces covered, and their Backs naked, did whip them|&s;elves
with &s;o much eagerne&s;s, that the Blood fol|lowed
the la&s;h. After the&s;e came the Inhabitants
of the place, each with a lighted Torch in his
Hand, and then the Prie&s;ts. Immediately after
them was carried the Image, repre&s;enting our Sa|viour's
de&s;cending from the Cro&s;s, which being
&s;urrounded with about 20 young <HI>Negroes</HI> Mask'd
and arm'd with Lances, with a Captain at the
head of them, and &s;everal Drums and Trumpets,
made alltogether a very &s;trange Spectacle. For,
after they had taken a round in the City, the Cru|cifix
was Solemnly Interr'd in a Sepulchre prepa|red
for that purpo&s;e; and I mu&s;t confe&s;s that this
Ceremony, which in other places, where the whole
is tran&s;acted with more decency, in&s;pires the peo|ple
with Devotion, did appear &s;o ridiculous among
the <HI>Portugue&s;es</HI> in tho&s;e parts, that I could &s;carce
forbear Laughing my &s;elf.</P>
<P>I went again to Church on <HI>Saturday,</HI> where I &s;aw

<HI>Ea&s;ter-Sunday,</HI> after I had been pre&s;ent at the Cere|mony,
when the Holy Sacrament was carried from
the <HI>Jacobin</HI> to the Pari&s;h Church, I heard there a
Sermon, which being the odde&s;t I ever heard in my

<PB N="189" REF="110">
it here: The Prie&s;t being come into the Pulpit,
and having made the Sign of the Cro&s;s;<NOTE PLACE="marg">A plea&s;ant Sermon.</NOTE> <Q>Gen|tlemen,

a Merry Fea&s;t to the Congregation; the &s;econd
to put you in mind of my <HI>Ea&s;ter</HI> Eggs; and
the third, to tell you a Merry Tale to make you
Laugh. Not to recede from my former Cu&s;tom,
and to give you all due &s;atisfaction as to the fir&s;t
point, I wi&s;h you all Merry <HI>Ea&s;ter</HI> Holy-days;
as to the &s;econd, I can a&s;&s;ure you, that if you
will be plea&s;ed to &s;end me &s;ome <HI>Ea&s;ter</HI> Eggs I will
not refu&s;e them. And as to what concerns the
third, I will only tell you, that I met ye&s;terday
our Fatgutted <HI>Gregory,</HI> and what do you think I
&s;aid to him? I asked him whether he would al|ways
act the Per&s;on of <HI>Pilate</HI> in the Pa&s;&s;ion of
our Saviour.</Q> With this he left the Pulpit, with|out
as much as imparting the Benediction to his Au|ditors,
who Laugh'd out aloud, that you might
have heard them at a con&s;iderable di&s;tance.</P>
<P>I pa&s;&s;ed the <HI>Ea&s;ter</HI> Holy-days with a great deal of
&s;atisfaction, which with the con&s;tant intreaties of
my Friends to &s;tay me for &s;ome time longer, would
have been a &s;ufficient motive for me not to quit a
place, where I received daily new proofs of their
Affection towards me, if I had not been engaged
upon my part to the Governour, to return to <HI>Da|man</HI>

<P>BEfore <HI>Donna Petronilla</HI> went to <HI>Trapor,</HI> &s;he had
done me the favour to introduce me into the
Acquaintance of Father <HI>John de St. Michael,</HI> Supe|riour
of the <HI>Jacobins,</HI> and at my departure, &s;he was
&s;o generous as to give me a Letter of Recommen|dation,
wherein, &s;he de&s;ir'd him to &s;erve me in eve|ry
thing that might be in his power. I had left my
Trunks and other moveables with him, when we
departed for <HI>Trapor,</HI> &s;o that I was obliged to make
my fir&s;t vi&s;it to him, and to fetch away my Trunks;
but the Father had the goodne&s;s to engage me to
&s;tay with him, till &s;uch time as I had taken a re&s;o|lution
whether I would &s;ettle at <HI>Daman,</HI> and if not,
till I &s;hould have taken a full view of all the Town,
to &s;atisfie my Curio&s;ity.</P>
<P>I remain'd with him thus 14 or 15 days, being
at a great uncertainty what to re&s;olve upon, till
at la&s;t being overcome by the Civilities and intrea|ties
of the Governour, and the Prayers of the In|habitants,
who made me very advantageous offers,
I thought I ought not to refu&s;e the kindne&s;s of my

promoters of my concerns.</P>
<P>Accordingly I left the Convent, and having &s;et|tled
my &s;elf in a Hou&s;e of my own, I cho&s;e &s;ome

times, when I was at lei&s;ure from my Practice,
which needs mu&s;t happen very often in a little place,

<P>There was at that time a certain Lady of great
Quality, called <HI>Senhora Franci&s;ca Sereira,</HI> living at
<HI>Daman,</HI> and one of her Daughters falling ill of a
violent and mo&s;t dangerous Fever, I was call'd

which &s;o deeply engaged the Lady in my intere&s;t,
that I cannot &s;ufficiently acknowledge her genero|&s;ity,
and mu&s;t confe&s;s that &s;he was one main in|&s;trument

<P>THE &s;hip which was to carry me to <HI>Lisbon,</HI>
was called the <HI>San Pedre de Ratel,</HI> of above
1500 Tuns, commanded by Captain <HI>Simon de Sou|&s;a.</HI>
It was the &s;even and twentieth day of <HI>January,</HI>
when we &s;ailed from the Bar of <HI>Goa,</HI> towards <HI>Lis|bon.</HI></P>
<P>So &s;oon as we were got under &s;ail, the Captain de|&s;ired
to &s;peak with me, and having told me, that
being &s;en&s;ible of my Capacity he had not taken with
him any Chirurgeons, but only a Barber to Trim
and let Blood upon occa&s;ion, and therefore he
hoped I would not refu&s;e the offer he would make
me, to take care of the Ship as a Phy&s;ician, and
that I &s;hould be honourably rewarded for my pains.
I return'd him thanks for his good Opinion, and
having accepted his offer, I was con&s;idered in the
quality of the Phy&s;ician of the Ship.</P>
<P>We went on with a favourable Gale, till we
came under the Equinoctial Line, where we were
becalmed for a few days, when the Winds proving
again to our &s;atisfaction, we continued our Voyage
with all the imaginable &s;ucce&s;s, till we came under
the thirteenth degree of Southern Latitude. There
it was that the Winds began to change continually,
but as it did not blow hard, &s;o we advanced &s;ome|thing
every day in our Voyage.</P>
<P><PB N="195" REF="113">
We pa&s;&s;ed a great way to the Ea&s;t of the I&s;le
<HI>Dauphin,</HI> and towards the end of the Month of
<HI>March</HI> came to the height of the Cape of <HI>Good Hope,</HI>
where our Pilots had a mind to &s;ound the Coa&s;t,
for their better In&s;truction, when they &s;hould hap|pen
to come this way another time; the Wind be|ing
then in the Ea&s;t, and con&s;equently very fair for
us, blew very briskly in the beginning of the Holy
Week, and on the Holy <HI>Wedne&s;day</HI> grew &s;o violent,
that we were forced to take in'mo&s;t all our &s;ails, and
to make u&s;e only of- our fore-ma&s;t Sail. The Sea
runs &s;o terribly high, that our &s;hip was to&s;&s;ed mo&s;t
violently; notwith&s;tanding which, we continued
our cour&s;e, knowing-our &s;elves to be far enough
from the &s;hoar, to &s;tand in fear of any &s;ini&s;ter acci|dent
from thence. But on <HI>Thur&s;day</HI> Morning, the
Wind chop'd about to the We&s;t,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Are over|taken by a violent Storm.</NOTE> and blew &s;o ter|ribly,
that we began to be afraid of our Ship,
which though one of the &s;tronge&s;t that ever I &s;aw,
let in &s;o much Water, that two Pumps were &s;carce
able to throw it out as fa&s;t as it came in. We chan|ged
our cour&s;e and run it before the Wind, which
continued with &s;o much violence, that even the
mo&s;t expert and mo&s;t courageous of our Seamen be|gan
to be afraid; but after a Storm which la&s;ted
four and twenty Hours, the Wind veering about
to the Ea&s;t, we altered a &s;econd time our Cour&s;e,
and with a moderate Gale &s;tood it in towards the
Cape, which we di&s;covered on the Holy <HI>Saturday</HI>
early in the Morning. We were again becalmed
for &s;ome days, till the next day after the Holy Days,
when with a North Ea&s;t Wind we doubled the Cape
of <HI>Good Hope,</HI> but were not within &s;ight of it, being
afraid of being becalmed again if we did not keep
out at Sea.</P>
<P>We &s;aw hereabouts &s;everal wracks of Ships which
we believed to have been lo&s;t in the late Tempe&s;t.</P>
<P>Towards Night we di&s;covered a Ve&s;&s;el, which
&s;teered a quite contrary cour&s;e to us; but as they are
con&s;tantly upon their Guard at Sea, our Captain or|dered
every thing to be got in readine&s;s, if there
<PB N="196" REF="114">
&s;hould be any occa&s;ion of Engaging an Enemy; but
the next Morning at break of day, we found them
at &s;o great a di&s;tance from us, that we had all the
rea&s;on to believe, there would be no occa&s;ion for
fighting at this time.</P>
<P>In the mean while,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Are trou|bled with the Scurvy.</NOTE> we had a wor&s;e Enemy
within our own Ship; this was that pernicious Evil,
the Scurvy, which in the month of <HI>April,</HI> began to
make a great havock among our Ships Crew, and
notwith&s;tanding all our Precautions, kill'd us &s;ome
of our Men every day: To add to our Affliction
we were often becalmed, till at la&s;t a favourable
Gale ari&s;ing, we made towards the Coa&s;t of <HI>Bra&s;il,</HI>
where we were to touch in our Voyage, &s;o that on
the <HI>19th.</HI> day of <HI>May,</HI> we di&s;covered the &s;hoar of
<HI>Bra&s;il,</HI> near the Bay of <HI>All-Saints.</HI></P>
<P>Some Fi&s;hermen who were out at Sea, having
di&s;covered our Ve&s;&s;el, came on board of us about
Noon, who undertook to conduct us &s;afely into the
Road, but had almo&s;t lo&s;t our Ship, &s;he &s;triking
upon the Sands, but as good fortune would have it,
&s;o &s;lightly, that it drew us into no further ill con|&s;equences.
But we had all the rea&s;on in the World
to thank Providence for our delivery, a Ship of the
&s;ame bulk with ours having been lo&s;t in the &s;ame
place &s;ome years before, &s;o that &s;carce a Man e&s;cap|ed
with life, of a thou&s;and that belonged to the
Ship. But the advantage of a very fair Day and
Wind, joined with the indefatigable care of our
Mariners, made us by God's Providence e&s;cape the
danger, which threatned no le&s;s than our De&s;tructi|on.
Being got clear of the Sands, we came to an
Anchor at a good di&s;tance from thence, and the next
day being the <HI>20th.</HI> of <HI>May,</HI> entered the Port and
ca&s;t Anchor before the Town, which bears the &s;ame
name with the Bay. We had lo&s;t five and twenty of
our Men in our Voyage from <HI>Goa,</HI> and had above
300 more on board, &s;o terribly afflicted with the
Scurvy, that if we had been detained but never &s;o
little a while longer at Sea, mo&s;t of them would in|fallibly
have died.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Our Arrival in Bra&s;il, and its De&s;cription.</HEAD>
<P>DUring my &s;tay in <HI>Bra&s;il,</HI> I got intimately ac|quainted
with a certain Merchant, a <HI>Spaniard</HI>

where the <HI>Portugue&s;es,</HI> (who where the fir&s;t and &s;ole

Colonies, which now, after a long and vigo|rous
War with the <HI>Dutch,</HI> who di&s;puted with them
the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it, they enjoy quietly. The Coun|try
is very plea&s;ant, the Air tolerably good and
temperate, by rea&s;on of the frequent Rains, which
in a great mea&s;ure, allay the heat of the Sun. The
Ground here produces abundance of Fruits with|out
being cultivated; &s;uch as Citrons, Lemons, O|ranges,
Ananas, Bananas, and &s;everal others. There
are al&s;o Grapes in <HI>Bra&s;il,</HI> but not in &s;uch plenty as
in <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P>They have prodigious quantities of Canes, which
turn to a mighty account, if the inhabitants did im|prove
them to the be&s;t advantage, and knew how
to vend them abroad. From <HI>Bra&s;il</HI> comes mo&s;t excellent
Tobacco, and here it is that they have &s;to<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">e of

they coming not near in bigne&s;s to tho&s;e in the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indies,</HI>

<P>BE&s;ides the <HI>Bra&s;il</HI> Wood there are &s;everal other
&s;orts of Trees in this Country,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Commodi|ties of <HI>Bra|&s;il.</HI></NOTE> quite unknown
to us in <HI>Europe,</HI> among which is the chiefe&s;t, the
Tree from whence de&s;tills that Bal&s;om, we &s;ur|name
of <HI>Peru:</HI> The Wood is made u&s;e of for Cabi|net
Work for Ladies of Quality, becau&s;e they have
a mo&s;t &s;weet Scent, and Perfume any thing that is
enclo&s;ed within them. In the Southern Parts of the
Coa&s;t,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Produces no Wheat.</NOTE> they have very good Wheat, but near the
Bay of <HI>All-Saints,</HI> there grows none, and mo&s;t
other parts of <HI>Bra&s;il</HI> are deprived of the advantage
of this &s;o u&s;eful a Commodity. They give two
rea&s;ons for it; fir&s;t, becau&s;e, &s;ay they, the Ground
is not fit for it; and &s;econdly, which I look upon
to be the better of the two, becau&s;e that they are
pe&s;tered hereabouts with &s;uch prodigious numbers of
Ants, that they con&s;ume the Grains before they take
root. Prillet and Rice grows in all parts of <HI>Bra&s;il,</HI>
but the ordinary Food of the <HI>Bra&s;ilians</HI> is the flower
<PB N="199" REF="115">
of <HI>Mandioc,</HI> which the <HI>French</HI> call <HI>Ca&s;&s;ave,</HI> and the
<HI>Portugue&s;e, Farina de Rao.</HI> This <HI>Mandioc</HI> root is pro|pagated
by cutting of it in pieces, and putting them
into the Ground where they grow to a con&s;iderable
bigne&s;s; they are very White, and if they are eaten
unprepared, they prove often mortal. They take
away their venomous quality by &s;teeping them in
Water, till they are &s;oft, when they take them out,
and let them dry; this they repeat &s;everal times, and
&s;o often, till they think them to be &s;ufficiently cured
of their ill Quality, when they make flower of it,
almo&s;t as cour&s;e in outward appearance as Gun|powder,
which at the be&s;t is but in&s;ipid and ve|ry
heavy, cau&s;ing ob&s;tructions in &s;uch as are not u|&s;ed
to eat it. They make Cakes out of this Flower,
which they call <HI>Bejous,</HI> they are of &s;omewhat a bet|ter
ta&s;te than the common Bread, but retain the
&s;ame ill quality.</P>
<P>They are furni&s;hed with Wheat from <HI>Rio de Ja|neiro,</HI>
and with good Flower from <HI>Portugal,</HI> &s;o
that they are not ab&s;olutely de&s;titute of wheaten
Bread in this Bay, but it is &s;omewhat dearer here
than in other places. They have al&s;o &s;ufficient &s;tore
of Oil, Wine, Linen Cloaths, Stuffs, and all o|ther
Commodities requi&s;ite for the Conveniency and
Nece&s;&s;ity of Human Life, which are imported
there from <HI>Europe.</HI> Their own Grounds furni&s;h
them &s;ufficiently with Fle&s;h, Poultry and Fi&s;h, and
Fruits and Sweet-meats are very cheap here.</P>
<P>But <HI>Bra&s;il</HI> is not without its great inconvenien|cies;
they are always pe&s;tered with a certain kind
of Vermin, or &s;mall Worms, of which I &s;hall have
occa&s;ion to &s;ay more hereafter in the Appendix of
this Relation, which treats of the Di&s;t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">mper<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"> in
tho&s;e parts: Be&s;ides this, the Ants of all &s;orts, but
e&s;pecially that kind which is of a reddi&s;h Colour,
and bigger than the re&s;t, are a continual Plague to
them; for they cover the Grounds where-ever they
light in &s;uch prodigious heaps, that at a di&s;tance
you would take them for a little Village. Neither

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the Inhabitants of Bra&s;il.</HEAD>
<P>NOT to entangle my &s;elf here in a tedious di|gre&s;&s;ion,
and di&s;tinction of the Inhabitants of
this Country; I will only tell you in a few words,
That the Native <HI>Bra&s;ilians</HI> are to this day, Idola|ters;
That they are much addicted to Witchcraft,
or at lea&s;t are reputed &s;o to be; they are very &s;uper|&s;titious,
have neither Temples nor Fea&s;ts, and adore
the Devil. Their Hair they wear of a great length,
their Complexion is &s;warthy, they go Naked, are
naturally Brave and Nimble, and never forgive an
Injury. Their Arms are only a few Arrows,
which in&s;tead of Iron, are provided with a bone
of a Fi&s;h at the end; and if any of them make u&s;e
of Iron, they are &s;uch as have got it by the conver&s;a|tion
with the <HI>Europeans.</HI> They are not unskilful
in Husbandry, but are more addicted to Hunting
and Fi&s;hing. They eat all &s;orts of Fle&s;h, and as they
never lay up any Provi&s;ions for future u&s;e, &s;o they
endure Famine upon an occa&s;ion with an unparallell'd
con&s;tancy. They are naturally Warlike, and al|ways
at Wars with one another; &s;uch of their
Enemies as they take Pri&s;oners, they Fetter, and
publickly kill them,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Bra&s;ilians</HI> eat their dead Friends.</NOTE> and &s;o eat them. They don't
even interr their dead Friends, but devour them, e|ven
&s;ometimes before the breath is out of their Bo|dies.
For if they judge their Friends pa&s;t all
<PB N="201" REF="116">
hopes of recovery, they kill them for fear they
&s;hould grow lean before they die; and becau&s;e
they would husband their Dead Friends to the be&s;t
advantage, they dry their Bones, which they beat
to Powder, and make up in a kind of a pap, and
&s;o eat it. When the <HI>Europeans</HI> upbraid them with
their Cruelties, they return us for an&s;wer, that we
are a Company of impious wretches, who &s;uffer our
Friends and Parents to be con&s;umed in the Earth by
the Vermine, when we might with more rea&s;on afford
them our Belly for their Burying-place.</P>
<P>The <HI>Portugue&s;es</HI> in <HI>Bra&s;il,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The</HI> Portu|gue&s;es <HI>in</HI> Bra&s;il.</NOTE> live here for the mo&s;t
part after the &s;ame manner as they do in other pla|ces,
where they have &s;ettled their Colonies. They
have very good Forts in &s;everal parts of the Coun|try.
They compel the Neighbouring <HI>Bra&s;ilians</HI> to o|bey
them, and are &s;o well provided in their Gar|ri&s;ons
as not to &s;tand in fear either of the <HI>Bra&s;ilians</HI>
or <HI>Europeans,</HI> in ca&s;e they &s;hould come to Attack
them.</P>
<P>Whenever any of the <HI>Portugue&s;es</HI> have the mis|fortune
to fall into the hands of the Wild <HI>Bra&s;ili|ans,</HI>
whether by the chance of War, or any other
mi&s;hap, they receive the &s;ame treatment as we
have mentioned before; and the&s;e on the other
hand retaliate upon &s;uch, as they become Ma&s;ters
of, the Cruelties committed again&s;t their Coun|try-Men,
and in lieu of one Death, make them to
undergo what is a thou&s;and times wor&s;e, I mean,
the mo&s;t cruel Slavery in the World; all what is
left for the <HI>Bra&s;ilians</HI> to do in this ca&s;e is either vo|luntarily
to &s;ubmit to the <HI>Portugue&s;es,</HI> or, if they
find them&s;elves not &s;trong enough to re&s;i&s;t them,
to fly and &s;helter them&s;elves in more remote Coun|tries.</P>
<P>The <HI>Portugue&s;es</HI> prompted by an Ambition to ex|tend
their borders, &s;end con&s;tantly abroad their
Parties, who by degrees, as they Conquer the&s;e
<HI>Barbarians,</HI> curb them by &s;ome Forts, which they
Build in their new Conque&s;ts. Whil&s;t I was there,
I was credibly informed that they had extended
<PB N="202" REF="117">
their Conque&s;ts above 80 Leagues deep into the
Country. They are very careful in in&s;tructing
the <HI>Bra&s;ilians,</HI> both Free and Slaves in the princi|ples
of the Chri&s;tian Religion; and there are &s;ome
among the <HI>Portugue&s;es</HI> who have Married the&s;e <HI>Bar|barian</HI>
Women, who tho' otherwi&s;e of a good Com|plexion
and hand&s;ome enough, yet in their Beha|viour
&s;ufficiently &s;hew the remnants of that Bar|barous
Blood from whence they drew their off|&s;pring,
and by which they are ea&s;ily di&s;tingui&s;h'd
from the <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> Women.</P>
<P>The va&s;t number of Slaves u&s;ed by the <HI>Portu|gue&s;es</HI>
in <HI>Bra&s;il,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Slave|ry in <HI>Bra|&s;il.</HI></NOTE> and the Hard&s;hip wherewith they
are treated, not having a &s;ufficient allowance for
their &s;u&s;tenance, and being to be Puni&s;hed in a
mo&s;t &s;evere manner for the lea&s;t fault, proves the
occa&s;ion of great di&s;orders and outrages, which are
committed by the Slaves, both in City and Coun|try.
They are for the mo&s;t part <HI>Negroes,</HI> brought
thither from <HI>Angola,</HI> and the <HI>Guinea</HI> Coa&s;t, their
chief Employment being to work in making of
Sugars, and Planting of Tobacco. They are
brought to Market in whole Droves, where they are
Bought and Sold no otherwi&s;e than we do our Cattle.
Tho&s;e who have great Plantations have &s;everal hun|dreds
of them at a time, who are under the tuiti|on
of certain Commi&s;&s;aries, who are &s;ometimes more
cruel than their Ma&s;ters. Tho&s;e who have no
Grounds of their own, give their Slaves leave to
work where they can, provided they pay them a
certain Tax Monthly or Weekly. Tho&s;e who
work in their Ma&s;ter's Ground being u&s;ed with &s;o
much &s;everity, if they fail to perform their Task,
and the re&s;t being commonly overtasked by their
Covetous Ma&s;ters, this makes them Rob and Steal
where-ever they come in the Country, and being
reduced to de&s;pair, they often revenge them&s;elves
upon others for the Torments they are forced to
endure at home.</P>
<P>If the&s;e Vagabond Slaves render the High-ways

<P>I Am not very well a&s;&s;ured whether Debauchery
is &s;o common all over <HI>Bra&s;il,</HI> as it is at the Bay
of <HI>All-Saints,</HI> where even Women who pretend to
a rea&s;onable &s;hare of Reputation, look upon it as

where Debauchery has got &s;uch an a&s;cendant as here.
The Women are generally great Admirers of all
Strangers, but e&s;pecially of the <HI>French;</HI> the wor&s;t

being naturally Jealous to a degree of Madne&s;s,
this infirmity of theirs proves &s;ometimes the occa|&s;ion

<P>A Young <HI>French</HI> Man who practi&s;ed Phy&s;ick in
<HI>Bra&s;il,</HI> was &s;ent for to a Lady that was very ill;
this Lady being Young, Hand&s;ome, and Rich,
the Young Phy&s;ician made u&s;e of his be&s;t Skill to
recover her as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible he could. He had
the good Fortune not only to re&s;tore her to her
Health in a little time, but al&s;o to in&s;inuate him|&s;elf
by his con&s;tant attendance, into the Affection
both of the Mother and Daughter, &s;o that &s;oon af|ter

<P><PB N="207" REF="119">
Some Enemies of the Young <HI>French</HI> Man who
envy'd his good Fortune, took an opportunity to
&s;et a certain Gentleman, who had Married his
Wife's Elde&s;t Si&s;ter again&s;t him, repre&s;enting to
him, how unbecoming and little &s;uitable it would
be to his Quality, to have a Brother-in-law that
was no more than a Chirurgeon, tho' he had a&s;&s;umed
the Title of a Doctor of Phy&s;ick, and who perhaps
be&s;ides all this might be a Heretick. The Gen|tleman,
who had more Wealth than good Sence,
being over-per&s;waded by the&s;e Malicious Fellows,
began to exclaim in the pre&s;ence of the re&s;t of

cut to pieces a certain Young Man, who bearing

&s;ought for, and who had &s;aved him&s;elf by flight,
pay'd dearly for it by the mi&s;take of the&s;e Villains,

&s;oon as they had got notice that they had mi&s;&s;ed
their aim.</P>
<P>The Young <HI>French</HI> Man finding him&s;elf thus in

<P>We were &s;carce well out at Sea, when the Winds

for near a Month after, &s;o that we were not

<P><PB N="209" REF="120">
The Wind veering about at the height of the
Cape of St. <HI>Au&s;tin,</HI> proved pretty favourable to us
till we came to Cape <HI>Verd.</HI> Much about the &s;ame
time it was we got &s;ight of the I&s;le called <HI>Ferdnand
de Narogna,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The I&s;le of</HI> Ferdnand de Narog|na.</NOTE> having borrowed its name from the

occa&s;ion for any. But &s;ome &s;trangers having left
&s;ome of their Dogs behind them, the&s;e are multi|plied
and become wild to that degree, that there is
no coming on &s;hoar in that I&s;land now a days.</P>
<P>As we came within ten degrees of the line,
the Wind began to be very changeable, and proved
&s;oon after quite contrary to us, but it blowing a
pretty even Gale, we advanced by little and little,
till a mo&s;t dreadful Tempe&s;t ari&s;ing, drove us till
under the <HI>26th.</HI> Degree, where a great many of our

<P>But after having weathered it out,<NOTE PLACE="marg">I&s;le of <HI>Ter|cera.</HI></NOTE> we at la&s;t came

have ended there his days, if they had not been

It was on the twenty fir&s;t of <HI>November,</HI> that we got
&s;ight of this I&s;land, and if the Seas had not run &s;o
high, we would have gone a &s;hoar to refre&s;h our

I&s;land, and that there is no &s;afe Anchoring in the
Road,<NOTE PLACE="marg">I&s;le of St. <HI>Michael.</HI></NOTE> we continued our cour&s;e, and on the three
and twentieth, came in &s;ight of the I&s;le of St. <HI>Mi|chael,</HI>
where abouts we &s;taid all that Night near the
Cape. The next Morning all our Ships &s;ent their
Chaloups a &s;hoar to fetch &s;ome fre&s;h Provi&s;ions, but
did not come to an Anchor, that they might be in
readine&s;s to put to Sea upon all occa&s;ions, the Hur|ricanes
being &s;o frequent here at this Sea&s;on, that
there is no &s;afe riding for Ships.</P>
<P>The I&s;les of St. <HI>Michael, Tercera,</HI> and &s;ome other

<P>Our Chaloups being returned on the four and
twentieth at Night, we &s;et &s;ail with a North We&s;t
Wind, which did not la&s;t long, for all on a &s;udden
the Wind chop'd about to the Ea&s;t,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Are over|taken by a mo&s;t dread|ful Tempe&s;t.</NOTE> and from
thence to the South with &s;uch violence, that this
tempe&s;t appear'd to me the mo&s;t terrible that ever I
&s;aw in my life. It continued thus for ten days to|gether
in &s;o dreadful a manner, as is &s;carce to be ex|pre&s;&s;ed;
our Ship began to draw Water on all &s;ides,
and we &s;aw before our Eyes nothing le&s;s than our
approaching death. We made all the &s;ignals of di|&s;tre&s;s
to the re&s;t by day, and by &s;etting up our lights
by night, but in vain, the horrid darkne&s;s, but
above all the violence of the Tempe&s;t, had di&s;per|&s;ed
all our Ships, &s;o that we found our &s;elves alone,
having lo&s;t all our &s;ails, except our Fore-ma&s;t &s;ail.</P>
<P>We had nothing left to hope for, and therefore be|took
our &s;elves to Prayers, and the whole &s;hips crew
made their Vows to the Ble&s;&s;ed Virgin, under who&s;e
protection we at la&s;t e&s;caped the danger. In the
mean while, every thing was in &s;uch a confu&s;ion, as
is ea&s;ier to be imagined than to be expre&s;&s;ed; the
Waves which ri&s;e as high as Mountains, beating
continually over the Ship, which we thought would
have been &s;wallowed up every moment in the bot|tomle&s;s
Aby&s;s. The approaching day rendred
every thing much more &s;upportable, but the dread|full
darkne&s;s of the Nights put us under &s;uch appre|hen&s;ions
of approaching death, that we were al|ways
de&s;pairing of ever &s;eeing day again. An ac|cident
which befell us the la&s;t Night, was the mo&s;t
terrible of all, which put even the mo&s;t couragious
into de&s;pair.</P>
<P>It is to be known, that we had &s;ome Top-ma&s;ts
and Yards in the Ship to make u&s;e of upon occa&s;ion,
which were &s;o well fa&s;tned upon the Deck, that they
had not &s;tirred hitherto. Our two Chaloups were
<PB N="211" REF="121">
placed a top of them, one within the other, and in
the &s;malle&s;t of the two, there were &s;ome hogs,
which we had brought from <HI>Bra&s;il,</HI> to make pre|&s;ents
of them in <HI>Portugal,</HI> they being of an extraor|dinary
&s;ize. The mo&s;t violent to&s;&s;ing of the Ship,
for &s;o many days together, had at la&s;t either loo&s;en|ed
or broke the Ropes, which had fa&s;tned all the&s;e
things together, &s;o that the Ma&s;ts, Yards and Cha|lops
rowling from one &s;ide to the other, accor|ding
to the motion of the Ship, and being thrown
again&s;t her &s;ides, we did not imagine otherwi&s;e but
that &s;he had been &s;taved to pieces; there was not
one in the Ship, but what was uttering forth his la&s;t
Prayers, expecting every moment to be the la&s;t of
his life.</P>
<P>We had Pa&s;&s;engers and Mariners on Board of
us of &s;everal different Nations, each of them offering
their Vows and Moans in a different Language;
this made the mo&s;t doleful noi&s;e that ever was heard,
which together with the darkne&s;s of the Night,
made every thing appear more dreadful than it was;
no body daring to go upon the deck for fear of
being cru&s;hed to pieces, as we found the Hogs to be
afterwards. At la&s;t, Day-light began to appear, the
mo&s;t wellcome that ever was &s;een, and our Mari|ners
taking new Courage with the approaching
light, fa&s;tned the Chaloups and Ma&s;ts again; and
&s;carce were a few hours pa&s;t, but the sky began to
clear up, the Sun rejoyced us with its mo&s;t delight|ful
Rays, the Winds began to abate their Fury, and
we &s;aw our &s;elves &s;oon freed from the apprehen&s;ion
of danger.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the City of Lisbon.</HEAD>
<P>THE City of <HI>Lisbon</HI> is the ordinary Re&s;idence
of the Kings of <HI>Portugal,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">City of <HI>Lisbon.</HI></NOTE> is one of the fine&s;t
and riche&s;t Cities in all <HI>Europe,</HI> which affords eve|ry
thing that is mo&s;t rare and precious in Foreign
Countries. It contains 7 Hills within the Precinct
of its Walls, on one of the&s;e Hills is Built the
Ca&s;tle. There are abundance of fine Churches in
<PB N="217" REF="124">
this City, among which, that of the <HI>Jacobin</HI> Fri|ars
excels all the re&s;t.</P>
<P>In one of the Chapels of this Church is an Altar,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Its Chur|ches.</NOTE>
where a Crucifix of an ine&s;timable value of Relieve,
is enclo&s;ed in an Iron Grate, with the Wound in
our Saviour's Side; it is daily expo&s;ed to publick
view, there being con&s;tantly kept 6 white Wax
Candles, and 7 Lamps burning before it. The
great Chapel belonging to the Cathedral is al&s;o a
mo&s;t magnificent Structure.</P>
<P>In a Convent called <HI>a Madre de Deos,</HI> there is to
be &s;een the Handkerchief of our Saviour Je&s;us
Chri&s;t, which mo&s;t precious Relick is &s;hew'd to
the people every Holy <HI>Friday</HI> in the After|noon.</P>
<P>The Streets of <HI>Lisbon</HI> are generally very narrow,
there being very few but &s;uch as have been lately
Built, which are pa&s;&s;able for Coaches, and I &s;up|po&s;e
it is upon this account that Chairs and Lit|ters
are &s;o much u&s;ed in this City.</P>
<P>The Royal Palace is Built upon the very Bank
of the River. The grand Place-Royal faces this
Ca&s;tle, called by the <HI>Portugue&s;es, Tereriro de Paco,</HI>
where they run at the Ring, and keep their Bull-fightings.</P>
<P>There are in <HI>Lisbon</HI> &s;everal good Market-places,
and other large and fine Squares; abundance of
&s;tately Buildings, and a great number of Fountains,
which are to be &s;een all over the City, and &s;erve
both for an Ornament to the City, and for the con|veniency
of the Inhabitants.</P>
<P>The <HI>Portugue&s;es</HI> are very cautious in following
the <HI>French</HI> Fa&s;hion in their Dre&s;&s;es. The <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI>
Women are very little, but well &s;hap'd. Ladies
of Quality appear abroad with their Faces unco|vered,
the re&s;t wear Veils, but they have a way
of opening them, when they have a Mind to be
&s;een.</P>

<P>AFter I had made the be&s;t Ob&s;ervations I could
concerning every thing I thought worth taking
notice of in <HI>Lisbon,</HI> I took Shipping in a Ve&s;&s;el,
which was bound to <HI>Bayonne</HI> in <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P>We weighed Anchor from before the Ca&s;tle of
<HI>Bethlehem</HI> on the 22d of <HI>July,</HI> and the next day
got out to Sea; but the Wind turning about, and
it blowing very hard all the following Night, our
Mizen Ma&s;t Split, &s;o that we were forced to make
towards the Shoar to refit.</P>
<P>We came to an Anchor the next day in the Port
of <HI>Ca&s;cais,</HI> where the Sieur <HI>Du Ca&s;&s;o,</HI> an Inhabitant
of <HI>Bajonne</HI> and I went a-&s;hoar, we continued there
till the 28th of the &s;ame Month, when we took
Shipping again, and got out at Sea a &s;econd
time.</P>
<P>But the Wind Steering about &s;oon after we were
fain to keep at a great di&s;tance from the Shoar;
&s;o we doubled the Cape of <HI>Fini&s;tre</HI> the 4th of
<HI>August,</HI> and Sailed along the Coa&s;t of <HI>Spain</HI> till
the 15th of the &s;ame Month, when we got &s;ight of
our Native Shoar, and at the &s;ame time of a Ve&s;&s;el
that was making all the Sail &s;he could towards
us.</P>
<P>We having no more than 25 Men, and 6 Guns
on Board, we thought it our be&s;t way to change
our Cour&s;e; but whil&s;t we were flying from our
&s;uppo&s;ed Enemy, we &s;oon got &s;ight of another,
which made us alter our Re&s;olution, and to pur&s;ue
<PB N="219" REF="125">
our former cour&s;e, which we did accordingly, but
&s;o near the Shoar, that we might have an opportu|nity

Night, &s;urrounded with terrible apprehen&s;ions both
of the danger of the Shoar and our Enemies, but
by Day-light &s;eeing but one of the Ships that were
in pur&s;uit of us the day before, and finding our
&s;elves not far off of the River of <HI>Bayonne,</HI> we made
all the &s;ails we could, and happily entred it the

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of Vomiting.</HEAD>
<P>VOmiting is the fir&s;t inconveniency Travel|lors
are afflicted with at Sea, it is cau&s;ed
partly by the motion of the Ship, partly by
the change of the Air.</P>
<P>Vomiting as common as it is, is &s;ometimes not
without danger. I have &s;een &s;ome people of a ten|der
Con&s;titution weakned by it to that degree, that
<PB N="224" REF="128">
they were in no &s;mall danger of their Life, by the
great lo&s;s of Spirits. Others I have &s;een, who for
3 or 4 Months together have not been able to &s;tir
out of their Beds.</P>
<P>To prevent in &s;ome mea&s;ure the violent Vomit|ting
at Sea, it is very convenient to take 2 or 3
proper Purges, a little before you go to Sea, e&s;pe|cially
if you have not lived very regularly before.
When you are at Sea, you may mitigate the vio|lence
of it, if you keep your &s;elf quiet betwixt
Decks, for the fir&s;t 4 or 5 days of your Voyage,
but not to ab&s;tain from Eating and Drinking, tho'
you &s;hould bring it up again immediately after;
for, if you Vomit with a full Stomach, you don't
&s;train &s;o violently as you do when it is empty,
when violent Vomitings cau&s;e often very dange|rous
<HI>Haemorrhagies.</HI></P>
<P>It is of great moment, to feed at fir&s;t upon no|thing
but what is of very ea&s;ie Dige&s;tion and good
nouri&s;hment, to drink but little Wine, and to ab|&s;tain
as much as po&s;&s;ible can be from Brandy or
Aqua vitae, it having been found by Experience
that &s;trong Liquors are &s;o far from fortifying the
Stomach upon this occa&s;ion, that they are rather

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the Scurvy, call'd by the French,

<P>THE Scurvy, call'd by the <HI>French</HI> Mariners,
the Land Evil, is the mo&s;t dangerous and trou|ble&s;ome
of all tho&s;e Di&s;tempers, which are inci|dent
to tho&s;e that undertake great Voyages; it
being not only contagious, but al&s;o &s;carce ever to
be cur'd till you get a&s;hoar.</P>
<P>The general Cau&s;es of this Di&s;temper are,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cau&s;es of the Scurvy <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word"> Sea.</NOTE> the
Sea Air, the Salt Provi&s;ion, both which cau&s;e great
alterations in the Blood; Melancholy, occa&s;ioned
by the tediou&s;ne&s;s, and other Inconveniencies of
long Voyages; Thir&s;t, the common Companion
of tho&s;e who are to pa&s;s into the Ea&s;tern-Parts,
and that commonly at &s;uch a time when they &s;tand
mo&s;t in need of Refre&s;hment. And la&s;t of all,
the Na&s;tine&s;s of the Mariners, who &s;eldom keep
them&s;elves clean and neat.</P>
<P>For which rea&s;on it is, that the Officers, and o|thers
above the common Rank on board the&s;e
Ships, are not &s;o much &s;ubject to the Scurvy as
the common Sea-men, becau&s;e they are better
provided with change of Linen, and feed upon
&s;uch things as are of a better Dige&s;tion and Nou|ri&s;hment.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t Symptoms of the Scurvy, appear mo&s;t
commonly in the Mouth and Gums, which &s;well,
grow black, and emit a very ill Scent, &s;o that you
are obliged to make very deep Inci&s;ions, and &s;ome|times
to take away a con&s;iderable quantity of cor|rupted
Fle&s;h and Matter, which not only loo&s;ens
<PB N="226" REF="129">
the Teeth, but al&s;o often makes them fall out.</P>
<P>This Di&s;temper di&s;covers it &s;elf al&s;o frequently
by certain black Spots,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Its Sym|ptoms and Signs.</NOTE> which appear upon the
Arms, Legs and Thighs, and la&s;t of all over the
whole Body; and it is to be ob&s;erved, that, the
broader the&s;e Spots are, and nearer the Heart,
the more dangerous is the Di&s;temper.</P>
<P>This Corruption of the Gums, and the breaking
out into Blotches is commonly preceded, or im|mediately
follow'd by a nau&s;eou&s;ne&s;s in the Sto|mach,
a Lazine&s;s by fainting and &s;wooning Fits,
pains in the Head, Arms and Legs, and a Loo&s;e|ne&s;s,
but &s;eldom by any Fever, I having often
ob&s;erved, that the Pul&s;e commonly appears very
little declining from its natural State and Mo|tion.</P>
<P>The Blood being (for Rea&s;ons above-alledged)
rendred thick and terre&s;trious, do's not circulate
freely in the le&s;&s;er Ve&s;&s;els, which are &s;pread in the
Gums, the extremities of our Bodies, and all
over our Skin; &s;o that its motion cea&s;ing in tho&s;e
parts, they are depriv'd of their u&s;ual &s;upply of
Spirits; what wonder is it if the coagulated Blood
go's into a Corruption, from whence proceed
tho&s;e Tumors and Blotches; And as the &s;aid Cor|ruption
is augmented in proportion, and commu|nicated
to other parts, the circulation of the Blood
is by degrees al&s;o ob&s;tructed in the larger Ve&s;&s;els;
from whence proceed tho&s;e violent Symptoms,
but e&s;pecially tho&s;e frequent Swoonings, which
are commonly the fore-runners of Death.</P>
<P>To prevent this <HI>Evil</HI> &s;o de&s;tructive to Mariners,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Precaution again&s;t the Scurvy.</NOTE>
the Officers, to who&s;e management the Ship is
committed; ought, before their Embarquement
to take effectual care that their Ships be Victuall'd
with good and &s;ound Provi&s;ion, that the Bi&s;cuits
be not mouldy, or the Victuals tainted, which is
too frequently practi&s;ed, to the great detriment
of the whole Ships-Crew, when either the Cap|tain
dares not contradict tho&s;e who have the Victu|alling
of the Ship, or when out of covetou&s;ne&s;s
<PB N="227" REF="129">
he &s;hares with others the Profits ari&s;ing by this
Malver&s;ation.</P>
<P>When they are out at Sea, the Officers belong|ing
to the Ship ought to be very careful to have
her kept <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word"> neat and clean, to cau&s;e her to be
well &s;wept, and wa&s;h'd with Sea-Water every day,
and to be &s;prink<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">'d and &s;weetn'd two or three
times a Week with good &s;trong Vinegar, which
purifies the Air, and renders it more &s;ubtil and
thin.</P>
<P>Each particular Per&s;on on board the Ship ought,
as far as is po&s;&s;ible, provide him&s;elf with the Juice
of Citrons, Limons, Ros &s;olis, pre&s;erv'd and dry'd
Fruits, but e&s;pecially with good Store of Prunes;
to ab&s;tain as much as can be, from all &s;orts of
Meat, which are in the lea&s;t tainted, from Salt-Fle&s;h
and Fi&s;h, unle&s;s they be well fre&s;h'd out; to
feed much upon Rice, Barley and Prunes, drink
Wine mix'd with Water, and not to ab&s;tain from
drinking if you be thir&s;ty, unle&s;s it be in ca&s;e of
the highe&s;t nece&s;&s;ity; to change frequently your
Linen, and to wa&s;h often your Mouths and the
whole Body, to clean&s;e it from all the Filth and
ill Scents, which are engendred by the continual
Sweats, and which hindring the in&s;en&s;ible Tran&s;pi|ration,
do not a little contribute towards the pro|duction
of the Scurvy.</P>
<P>But if a body be already &s;eiz'd with this pernici|ous
Di&s;ea&s;e, which will &s;oon appear by the &s;wel|ling
and blackne&s;s of the Gums, no time ought
to be neglected to &s;top the progre&s;s of this Evil,
which in a little time will &s;pread all over the Bo|dy.
If it be in a plethorick and vigorous Body,
it will not be ami&s;s to lett a little Blood, to facili|tate
the circulation of the <HI>Blood;</HI> but this ought
not to be done in great quantity, for fear of im|pairing
the Patient's Spirits, who in this Di&s;tem|per
&s;tands in need of all his &s;trength to &s;upport
him again&s;t his Enemy.</P>

rea&s;on of the &s;carcity of fre&s;h Water on board <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word">

<P>The next thing you have to do is to mix &s;ome

&s;ome Salt, wherewith you mu&s;t carefully wa&s;h

Rice and Barley, and I can a&s;&s;ure you, that if

which they have receiv'd by Tradition from their

without making the lea&s;t reflection upon the
different Age, Sex, Con&s;titution, o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"> Strength of
their Patients. They are very timorous, and ra|ther
will let a Patient peri&s;h than run the hazard
of a Remedy, which, as they believe, not being
&s;ufficiently approved by experience, appears
doubtful to them, though they judge the Di|&s;temper
to be mortal, or incurable without it.</P>
<P>Neverthele&s;s it is ob&s;ervable, that by their long
experience they have made &s;uch Ob&s;ervations con|cerning
certain Di&s;tempers peculiar to tho&s;e
Countries, that they practi&s;e with better &s;ucce&s;s
than the mo&s;t learned foreign Phy&s;icians, who up|on
certain occa&s;ions mu&s;t follow their foot&s;teps,
if they expect to &s;ucceed in their Cures in this
Climate.</P>
<P>They never allow their Patients afflicted with
any kind of Fever in the <HI>Indies,</HI> neither Meat,
neither Eggs or Broath, this would be as much as
the Patient's life is worth, if they &s;hould give
them any of the&s;e things. They allow them no
other Drink but fair Water, and for the re&s;t for
their &s;u&s;tenance, they give them a <HI>Cange,</HI> which
is made in the following manner.</P>
<P>They beat about half a Pound of Rice in two
or three quarts of Water, which they boil &s;o long,
till the Rice be well broken, which is commonly
done in an hours time. Then they &s;train it thro'
a Linen-Cloth, and &s;queeze it well to draw out
all the goodne&s;s from the Rice; of this they give
a Spoonful at a time, four or five times a day to
the Patient, making it always warm, and putting
a little Salt into it, to make it the more &s;avory.

take more Nouri&s;hment, whil&s;t he is &s;ick, than
perhaps he u&s;ed to do when he was in Health? It
being beyond all que&s;tion, that Jelly-broath taken
perhaps &s;even or eight times a day, and new-laid
Eggs, which we give our Patients, contain more
Nouri&s;hment, and produce a greater quantity of
pure Chyle than a moderate quantity of Bread
and Meat, which is the ordinary Food of People,
when they are in good Health.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides this, the <HI>Cange</HI> has al&s;o this Excellency,
that it cau&s;es no aver&s;ion in the Patient, which is
the general Inconveniency in the&s;e &s;trong Broths,
which being taken with &s;o much Repugnancy,
can &s;carce be &s;uppo&s;ed to produce any good effect.</P>
<P>If it be a continual Fever, they allow them no|thing

they allow them betwixt the Fits, to eat a little
Bread and Sweet-Meats; But no kind of Meat or

them, and that there is no fear of a Relap&s;e.</P>

them &s;ome Sirups of Simples, to wit: of Cicho|ry,
Ro&s;es, Limons and Maidenhair.</P>

by the help of &s;uch &s;mall quantities of Phy&s;ick.</P>
<P>The <HI>Pandites</HI> perceiving the Urine of the Pa|tient
that is afflicted with a Fever to be white,
they judge it to proceed from a cold Cau&s;e, with|out
having the lea&s;t re&s;pect to the <HI>Delirium</HI> and
other Symptoms, which are the ordinary &s;igns of
this Urine.</P>
<P>For which purpo&s;e they put Pepper in the
<HI>Cange,</HI> which they apply to the Patient's Head,
to warm the Brains, which, they &s;ay, are too
cold; and for the &s;ame rea&s;on it is, that they will
not let blood in &s;uch a ca&s;e, before they find the

<HI>Delirium;</HI> the Lady, upon the per&s;wa&s;ion of a
certain <HI>Pandite,</HI> who had been a Phy&s;ician to the
Family a great while, made u&s;e of his Pre&s;cripti|ons,
without letting me know any thing of the
matter; But finding her Child grow wor&s;e and
wor&s;e, &s;he &s;ent to me unknown to the <HI>Pagan</HI>

Daughter. It was the ninth Day, when I was
call'd to her, and finding her Urine of a whiti&s;h
colour, and the Fever very high with a violent
<HI>Delirium,</HI> I drew from thence far different Indi|cations
to what the <HI>Pandite</HI> had done; and having
remon&s;trated to her Mother the danger of her
Daughter, who was not above &s;even years of
age, I order'd her to be let blood immediately.
The <HI>Indian</HI> Phy&s;ician hapning to come in the &s;ame
moment, maintain'd in my pre&s;ence, that the
Fever proceeding from a cold Cau&s;e, the young
Lady would infallibly die if &s;he were let blood;
but I laugh'd at the weakne&s;s of his Argument,
and my Advice prevailing with the Childs Friends,
&s;he was let blood, and I took from her head the
Pepper mixt with the <HI>Cange,</HI> of which there was
near half a pound, very finely beaten upon the
Childs head; I let her, in all, five or &s;ix times
blood, after which the Fever left her, and I con|&s;ummated
the Cure by giving her 2 or 3 Purga|tions,
contrary to the expectation of the <HI>Pagan</HI>

Its &s;igns are, &s;udden Heat, pains in the

<P>The fir&s;t and chief Remedy to be apply'd to
tho&s;e whom they imagine to be &s;eiz'd with the

with a red hot Iron of the thickne&s;s of a common

<PB N="238" REF="135">
of the Patient cro&s;s the Ankles, in that part where
it is mo&s;t callous, and hold it clo&s;e to the place,
till the Patient begin to cry out, and &s;ignifie there|by
that he begins to be &s;en&s;ible of the Pain, when
it is taken away immediately; which done, they
take a Slipper or &s;ome &s;uch thing, and give two or
three good Stroaks upon the place, where the Iron
has toucht, which prevents the ri&s;ing of a Bli&s;ter,
without any further Application.</P>
<P>This manner of burning with an Iron, as ter|rible
as it appears at fir&s;t &s;ight, does not any con|&s;iderable
to the place where it is apply'd; and I
have &s;een &s;ome walk as freely immediately after,
as if they had not been touch'd with any thing.
It is certain that this Remedy &s;tops the violence of
the <HI>Mordechi,</HI> and oftentimes cures all its Sym|ptoms
in an in&s;tant; and if it happen that the
Fever continue &s;ome time after, it never proves
dangerous, and is ea&s;ie to be cur'd by ordinary
Remedies.</P>
<P>It is al&s;o in the&s;e Fevers, that the <HI>Indians</HI> put a|bundance
of Pepper in the <HI>Cange,</HI> which they give
both inwardly to the Patients, and apply it out|wardly
to their Heads, as we have mention'd it
before. And generally &s;peaking, it is only by
the&s;e means and burning under the Feet, they
cure this Di&s;temper, without letting Blood,
which would infallibly prove mortal, if it were
made u&s;e of in the beginning of this Di&s;temper.
Neither do they pre&s;cribe any Purgations (if there
be occa&s;ion for any) till after the mo&s;t violent
Symptoms are cea&s;ed, and that there is no further
appearance of a Fever.</P>
<P>I don't in the lea&s;t que&s;tion, but that abundance
of People will look upon this Cure, which is
perform'd by burning the Feet, as ridiculous, and
not fit to be taken notice of, con&s;idering there
&s;eems to be &s;o very &s;lender a relation betwixt the
Remedy and the Di&s;temper, for which it is put in

don't make u&s;e of any Purgations, nay not &s;o much
as of any Anodyne Cly&s;ters, which they &s;ay, would
encrea&s;e the Evil, but in lieu of them they make

<P>I am apt to believe, that tho&s;e who rightly under

being taken dangerou&s;ly ill of a Dy&s;entery with a

<P>It was no &s;mall di&s;&s;atisfaction to me, to find,

which they &s;ay, is found in the Heads of &s;ome

they apply to the place where the Adder has fixed
her Poy&s;on, where the Stone fa&s;tens it &s;elf, with|out
any other help, and having &s;uck'd in as much
of the Poy&s;on, as it is able to contain, it falls off;
Then they put it in Milk, where having di&s;cha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">g'd
the Poy&s;on it had attracted before, it is apply'd
afre&s;h in the &s;ame manner, as before, till &s;uch time
that it will not fa&s;ten no longer, which is an evi|dent
&s;ign, that the Poy&s;on is removed, and the

<P>It is ob&s;ervable, that when this Stone is put in
Milk to di&s;charge the Poy&s;on, the Milk appears
as if Excrements had been put into it, and
of &s;everal Colours. I have been frequently an
eye-witne&s;s of the &s;tupendious effects of this
Stone; but the wor&s;t is, that it is a great Rarity

<P>If it therefore happen that any one be bitten
by an Adder, and you have not any of the&s;e
true Stone, at hand, the be&s;t way is to have that
part where the Wound is, &s;carified, and by the
help of Cups to draw as much Blood from thence
as you can; afterwards apply to the place &s;uch Re|medies,
as have a peculiar Vertue to attract Poy|&s;on,

For which purpo&s;e it is convenient, to

you eat, drink Wine, and take inwardly the true
Powder of Vipers, provided it may be had una|dulterated.

&s;mall Creature; be&s;ides which the <HI>Portugue&s;es</HI> u&s;e
it for three &s;everal &s;orts of Di&s;tempers, peculiar
to the Inhabitants of the Coa&s;t of <HI>Bra&s;il.</HI></P>
<P>The fir&s;t is occa&s;ioned by a certain kind of a
Worm, long and pretty thick, which being en|gendred
in the Legs, cau&s;es mo&s;t cruel Pains, af|terwards
<PB N="247" REF="139">
very &s;ordid Ulcers, and la&s;t of all, an
incurable Gangrene, if you don't prevent it in
time; by opening the Skin where it lies, from
whence you may draw out the Worm by winding
of it gradually round a large Needle or &s;mall
Sticks, but very gently, for fear of tearing the
Worm in pieces, in which ca&s;e you mu&s;t make a
large Inci&s;ion, to take out the remaining part;
The Worm being remov'd, you may apply com|mon
Detergents to the Ulcer, and afterwards Ci|catri&s;e
it, after the ordinary way.</P>
<P>The <HI>Bicho</HI> of the &s;econd kind is a Worm, but
&s;o &s;mall, as it is impo&s;&s;ible to be &s;een by the mo&s;t
clear-&s;ighted. They are in great quantities in rui|ned
Hou&s;es, as well as new Buildings, and among
Excrements and Du&s;t.</P>
<P>They enter in&s;en&s;ibly thro' the Pores of the
Skin, e&s;pecially in the Feet, in&s;inuate them&s;elves
betwixt the Fle&s;h and Skin, and will &s;ometimes
&s;ettle under the Nails. The <HI>Negro's</HI> and <HI>Bra&s;ilians,</HI>
who go bare-footed, are often troubled with
them, and the <HI>Europeans,</HI> tho' they commonly
wear Shoo's and Stockins, are not always free
from this Mi&s;chance. The&s;e &s;mall Worms, don't
cau&s;e any immediate Pain; on the contrary, it is
a great while before you are &s;en&s;ible of them, un|le&s;s
you carefully look upon your feet every day.
But they &s;oon increa&s;e in your Skin, and in four|teen
or fifteen days time, grow as big as a Pea,
and do ea&s;ily di&s;cover them&s;elves by their black
Colour. The &s;afe&s;t way is, to take them out as
&s;oon as you are &s;en&s;ible of them; for the longer
they remain in the Skin, the more difficult they
are to be taken out; and, if they are there long
enough, they will cau&s;e a Corruption, which pro|duces
&s;uch malignant Ulcers, that I have &s;een of|tentimes
<HI>Negro's,</HI> to have the Fle&s;h of their Feet
corrupted in &s;o mi&s;erable a manner, that the bare
Bones appear'd.</P>
<P>It is next to an impo&s;&s;ibility to avoid catching of
the&s;e Worms: The only way is to take care not to
<PB N="248" REF="140">
let them &s;ettle long in the Skin; for if they be
taken in time, they are not attended with any
con&s;iderable ill con&s;equences. If they have cau&s;ed
any Corruption or Ulcers, they may be cur'd after
the common way, after you have taken out the
Worms, or have kill'd them with Tobacco-pow|der.
Be&s;ides this, the <HI>Portuge&s;es,</HI> living on the
Coa&s;t of <HI>Bra&s;il,</HI> are pe&s;ter'd with another Di&s;tem|per,
which they call <HI>Bicho;</HI> This is an Inflama|tion
in the Fundamental, which as it is very com|mon,
&s;o it is no le&s;s dangerous in this Country;
Heat-aches and Burning-heats in the affected part,
being the con&s;tant companions of the&s;e Inflama|tions,
which are often not without a Fever; and
if neglected, produce in a few days time very
malignant Ulcers, from whence this Di&s;temper
has gotten the name <HI>Bicho.</HI></P>
<P>Such as keep the&s;e parts clean by wa&s;hing them
often with fair Water only, are le&s;s &s;ubject to this
Evil, than &s;uch as do otherwi&s;e. As &s;oon as you
find your &s;elf &s;iez'd by this Di&s;temper, bath it
oftentimes a day with a Decoction made of Li|mons,
and mix with it a little Salt. You may al|&s;o
put with good &s;ucce&s;s Slices of Limons within
your Fundament, which often cures the Di&s;tem|per
without any more ado, if you take it in the
beginning. But if it be already gone into a Cor|ruption,
they u&s;ed to dilate &s;ome Gun-powder
with a &s;ufficient quantity of Ro&s;e or Plantain-Water,
in which Liniment they dip &s;ome Linen-Rags,
which they put in the Fundament, not neg|lecting
to bath it before with the Decoction of Li|mons.
Special care is to be taken, that if a Fever
appear in this ca&s;e, not to let blood, it having
been found by Experience, that it has always
prov'd prejudicial. It is much more &s;afe to keep
con&s;tant to Anodyne and Deter&s;ive Cly&s;ters, ac|cording
as the Corruption or Inflammation is more
or le&s;s, and to conclude the whole Cure with a
gentle Purge.</P>

They have al&s;o another way of entangling them

fa&s;ten very large Nets round the Woods where
they know them to re&s;ort in whole Troops; which

lived there for &s;ometime, may be carried with
much better pro&s;pect to the <HI>Indies,</HI> than the&s;e,
who but lately were brought out of <HI>Europe,</HI> fora&s;|much
as they being already accu&s;tomed to the
heats of the Climate, their con&s;titution mu&s;t needs
be more agreeable to the Climate of the <HI>Indies.</HI></P>
<P>I would advi&s;e to carry to the <HI>Indies</HI> no other but
Secular Prie&s;ts, the re&s;t being generally Ambitious
and too much addicted to their own Intere&s;ts, and
always intermeddling with State-Affairs, and
&s;uch other Matters as have not the lea&s;t affinity
with the Character they ought to bear in the
World.</P>
<P>I would have this Company take this for a
Maxim in their Colonies: <HI>One Nation, one Reli|gion.</HI>
The <HI>Dutch</HI> mixed with the <HI>French,</HI> and the
<HI>Hugonots</HI> with the <HI>Catholicks,</HI> did never live in a
good Union. We are obliged for this to the Pie|ty
of <HI>Lewis le Grand,</HI> that in <HI>France</HI> there is now
but one, and that the true antient Religion; nei|ther
&s;ee I the lea&s;t rea&s;on, why the <HI>French</HI> &s;hould
have any occa&s;ion to make u&s;e of &s;trangers in their
Colonies in the <HI>Indies.</HI> I am well a&s;&s;ured that the
<HI>French</HI> are alone in a capacity to live under what
Climate &s;oever; They Inhabit a Country &s;urround|ed
by the <HI>Spaniards, Portuge&s;es, Engli&s;h</HI> and <HI>Dutch,</HI>
who have e&s;tabl&s;hed them&s;elves under the <HI>Torrid-Zone,</HI>
in the <HI>Indies,</HI> and in <HI>America.</HI></P>
<P>To give the <HI>French</HI> their due; there is not a
more Civiliz'd Nation in the World, their Manners
and Conver&s;ation being look'd upon as mo&s;t agree|able
to Introduce them&s;elves in all places. Be&s;ides
which they are very Populous, Brave and Daring,
which makes them have an ea&s;ie acce&s;s wherever
they come&punc; I appeal to experience, the kind Re|ception
they met with in the Empire of the <HI>Great
<PB N="39" REF="161">
Mogul,</HI> of <HI>Calicut, Siam,</HI> and other places in the
<HI>Indies,</HI> of late years, are &s;o many convincing de|mon&s;trations,
that the&s;e Princes received them in
their Territores with a more than ordinary &s;atis|faction.</P>
<P>Care ought to be taken that &s;ome Per&s;ons may
be &s;ent into <HI>Japan,</HI> to undeceive that Prince, con|cerning
the wrongful opinion the <HI>Japone&s;es</HI> are
prepo&s;e&s;s'd with in prejudice of the Catholick Reli|gion.
And all opportunities ought to be courted to
get footing in this, as well as the <HI>Chine&s;e</HI> Empire.</P>
<P>But it ought to be ob&s;erved, that the per&s;ons in|tru&s;ted
with the&s;e Negotiations in the&s;e two Em|pires,
as well as in the other parts of the <HI>Indies,</HI>
ought to be men of Experience and Authority:
The&s;e, as well as all other publick Affairs of Con|&s;equence,
ought not to be left to the management
of Merchants; as it is in <HI>Holland,</HI> where Merchants
have a great &s;hare in managing Affairs of &s;tate, and
the Courts of Ju&s;tice, and con&s;equently are better
qualified for &s;uch bu&s;ine&s;s than tho&s;e of <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P>Care ought to be taken that from time to time,
Envoy's may be &s;ent to tho&s;e parts, who may re|lieve
one another; and that they may be provided
with good Yearly Salleries which mu&s;t be paid
them exactly, without being pinch'd in their Al|lowances
by tho&s;e who have the management of
the Trea&s;ury in their hands. For if Per&s;ons in &s;uch
a Station find them&s;elves neglected, they will be
&s;ure to lo&s;e no opportunity to retrieve them&s;elves
at any rate.</P>
<P>It is al&s;o ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary for the Company,
to have a Certain City both in the <HI>Ea&s;t</HI> and <HI>We&s;t-Indies,</HI>
which lying, as near as can be, in the Center
of the <HI>French</HI> Colonies, mu&s;t be the re&s;idence of
the Generali&s;&s;imo's, each in his re&s;pective place.
The Cities ought to be of an Advantagious &s;ituati|tion,
both in re&s;pect of their Fortifications and the
conveniency of their Harbours.</P>
<P>The I&s;le of <HI>Madega&s;car</HI> ought to be con&s;idered
as the chief place of Retreat for &s;uch Ships of the
<PB N="40" REF="162">
Company as Sail to the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indies.</HI> I am ab&s;o|lutely
of opinion, that the fir&s;t project made in
<HI>France</HI> concerning that I&s;land, ought not to be laid
a&s;ide, but is to be pur&s;ued to all its intents and
purpo&s;es. For be&s;ides that, it is not for the Ho|nour
of <HI>France</HI> thus to abandon an Enterpri&s;e,
which they look'd upon as &s;o advantagious to the
Nation; The &s;ituation of this I&s;land, its Products
and Riches&punc; are &s;ufficient Invitations for us to e|&s;tabli&s;h
our Colonies among them.</P>
<P>It ought to be taken into Con&s;ideration, that
this I&s;land lies betwixt the two <HI>Indies,</HI> there is as
good a Road near <HI>Fort-Dauphine,</HI> and in the Bay of
<HI>Antogil.</HI> Beef there is in &s;uch plenty, that we have
taken forty Thou&s;and Oxen at a time, after we
had defeated one of their <HI>Grands.</HI> Wild-Fowl,
Fi&s;h, Fruits, Grapes, Honey and Wax it produces
in great abundance, and the very Mountains bring
forth good &s;tore of Rice. Their Waters are excel|lently
good, and the Ground is very Rich and
Fruitful. There is not the lea&s;t que&s;tion, but that
if the Grounds were carefully cultivated they
would produce very good Wheat, and the Grapes
might be brought to maturity. But if it were o|therwi&s;e,
Wheat may be ea&s;ily Tran&s;ported thither
from <HI>Suratte,</HI> from the Coa&s;t of <HI>Malabar</HI> and <HI>Co|romandet,</HI>
where it is very Cheap. The defect of
good Wine might be ea&s;ily &s;upplyed from the <HI>Ca|nary</HI>
I&s;lands, where it co&s;ts not above four Pence a
Pint, and a Pint con&s;idering its &s;trength, will
go further than a Quart of <HI>French</HI> Wine; be&s;ides
that, this Wine gows better by keeping, it being
much finer after it has lain four years, than it was
at the fir&s;t. It would al&s;o be no difficult matter to
tran&s;port thither of our <HI>Grave</HI> Wine, <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> and
<HI>Goat</HI> Wines, and as much Brandy as they have oc|ca&s;ion.</P>
<P>There is &s;carce any Commodity which the <HI>Euro|peans</HI>
are Ma&s;ters of in <HI>Africa, America&punc;</HI> and <HI>A&s;ia,</HI>
but what you meet with in the I&s;le of <HI>Madaga&s;car&punc;</HI>
They have Pepper, a &s;ort of Nutmegs, and Clove-Trees,
<PB N="41" REF="162">
all &s;orts of Gums,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Riches of <HI>Madag<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;|car.</HI></NOTE> Spices, Sugar, To|bacco,
precious Stones, Silver and Gold.</P>
<P>I cannot be per&s;uaded, that what the Natives tell
us is true; to wit, that what Gold they have, was
brought into the I&s;land by &s;ome Ships which Ca&s;u|ally
came near that &s;hoar, whereof &s;ome peri&s;hed
thereabouts; there being &s;carce a Man or Woman
&s;o mean, but what have &s;ome Golden Ornaments
about them; not to mention here the Trea&s;ures
hoarded up by their <HI>Grands,</HI> which they never
touch but in ca&s;e of the greate&s;t extremity; and
&s;eems to be a convincing argument, that there are
&s;ome Gold Mines in this I&s;land.</P>
<P>The Sieur <HI>de la Ca&s;e</HI> was not ignorant of this ad|vantage,
and Mon&s;ieur <HI>de la Milleray,</HI> was &s;o well
convinced of the Riches and true Value of the
Products of this I&s;land, that he would never part
with his right, while he lived.</P>
<P>The Sieur <HI>de Caron</HI> got once into his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;i|on
a piece of Amber-Gree&s;e, weighing Eighteen-Ounces.
There is a Prodigious quantity of Silk
and Cotton in the I&s;land, and yet the&s;e are the
chief Commodities, which are brought out of the
Territories of the <HI>Great Mogul,</HI> and of fourteen o|ther
Kings, his Tributaries, who all mu&s;t be court|ed
by great Pre&s;ents to allow the Exportation of
the&s;e Commodities.</P>
<P>As for the Air of <HI>Madaga&s;car,</HI> it is very whole|&s;ome
and pure, witne&s;s tho&s;e of its Inhabitants
who arrive to a great age, it being common a|mong
them to &s;ee &s;ome of a Hundred and Twenty
years of Age. It cannot be deny'd, but that it has
not proved &s;o agreeable to the <HI>Fren<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">h</HI> con&s;tituti|on,
but if the matter be duly weighed, it will ap|pear,
that this proceeded more from the change of
Diet, and from their carle&s;ne&s;s in not keeping
their Stomachs warm, than from any other cau&s;e;
For I have made this ob&s;ervation, that tho&s;e born
under a cold Climate, if tran&s;ported into tho&s;e
parts, ought not to neglect that point, as they ten|der
their health and lives.</P>
<P><PB N="42" REF="163">
There is one objection to be made, to wit:
That &s;everal other Nations, who have taken a&punc;
view of the I&s;le of <HI>Madaga&s;car,</HI> never &s;hew'd any
Inclination to P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ant their Colonies here; But this
I think derogates nothing from the true value
which ought to be put upon this I&s;land. For it is
po&s;&s;ible,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Why other Nations never &s;et|led in this I&s;land.</NOTE> that the&s;e Nations who are le&s;s powerful
than the <HI>French,</HI> being before &s;ettled in many o|ther
places, found them&s;elves not in a capacity to
Conquer an I&s;land, which is the bigge&s;t in the whole
World.</P>
<P>The <HI>Portugue&s;es</HI> have their Settlements in the <HI>In|dies,</HI>
and the Ports of <HI>China.</HI> The <HI>Dutch</HI> in the I&s;le
of <HI>Ceylon,</HI> and the <HI>Molucees,</HI> and in &s;hort in all o|ther
places in the <HI>Indies,</HI> where the <HI>Portugue&s;es</HI>
had e&s;tabli&s;hed them&s;elves before. The <HI>Engli&s;h</HI>
have their Forts on the <HI>Malabar</HI> Coa&s;t, at <HI>Coroman|del,</HI>
and &s;everal other places in the <HI>Indies,</HI> where
they Traffick with le&s;s charge and inconveniency,
than in a place which they were fir&s;t to be po&s;&s;e&s;s'd
or by force of Arms.</P>
<P>The re-e&s;tab<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">i&s;hment of the <HI>French</HI> in the I&s;le of
<HI>Madaga&s;car,</HI> ought to be committed to the ma|nagement
of a Per&s;on, who by his Merits and long
Experience has acquired a great Reputation abroad;
This being a point of that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">icety, and &s;uch a na|ture,
where one man by his Conduct may be able
to do more than a thou&s;and others who act with|out
prudence.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t thing the <HI>French</HI> have to do after their
Landing, is to re-fortifie the Fort <HI>Dauphine,</HI> which
they ought to look upon as the Capital of their
Colonies here, and mu&s;t be the re&s;idence of the
Governour, by rea&s;on of the temperature of the air,
and its convenient &s;ituation, which is on the Point
of <HI>Madaga&s;car.</HI></P>
<P>The Conque&s;t of this I&s;land is not &s;o difficult as
&s;ome have Imagined, the <HI>Grands,</HI> (or Lords) of
the Country, being divided among them&s;elves by
&s;o many different Intere&s;ts, that the mo&s;t Power|ful
<PB N="43" REF="163">
among them is not in a capacity to bring one
hundred part of the Inhabitants <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word"> Arms. Their
Arms having no compari&s;on to ours, they are &s;o
frightened at our Fire-locks, that we have &s;een
160 <HI>Frenchmen</HI> Force one third part of the I&s;le to
do homage to them. <HI>Dian Manangve,</HI> who be|ing
one of their Principal Lords, and the only per|&s;on
that had got an in&s;ight into the <HI>French</HI> Affairs,
is now dead; and their Reb<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">llion chiefly carried on
by his advice again&s;t the <HI>French,</HI> ought to &s;erve
them as a precaution for the future, not to admit
any of their <HI>Grands</HI> into their Councils, and to let
them have any knowledge in the Military Art.</P>
<P>The <HI>Madaga&s;carians</HI> are naturally jealous of
their Liberty, Rebel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters">ous, Mi&s;tru&s;tful, and Re|vengeful,
&s;eldom forgetting an injury. It will
be therefore the Duty of a Governour to take &s;uch
mea&s;ures as may be mo&s;t effectual to curb their In|&s;olency,
and e&s;pecially &s;o to clip their wings for
time to come, as to put them beyond all probabi|lity,
to execute their vengeance and cruelties upon
their Conquerers.</P>
