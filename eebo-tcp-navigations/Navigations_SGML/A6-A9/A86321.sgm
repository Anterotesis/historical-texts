<DIV4 TYPE="subsection">
<HEAD>Fir&s;t:</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. By the &s;peedy rai&s;ing a &s;tock of Cattel, though from a very mean prin|ciple, and beginnings: a notable Po|licy in the thriving <HI>Spaniard</HI> upon <HI>Hi&s;paniola,</HI> and e&s;pecially, on <HI>Cuba,</HI> which is better <HI>peopled;</HI>) and 'tis this: Near &s;ome convenient place, in the Wood, that is be&s;t <HI>&s;tored</HI> with all &s;orts of <HI>fruit-bearing</HI> Trees, as Orange-trees, a &s;ort of Cabbage-trees, rag'd with berries, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> they build two or three little Hou&s;es, or more; by them called a <HI>Crawle,</HI> and in the&s;e, they fir&s;t inclo&s;e the&s;e tame Hogs, with which they begin their &s;tock, and there feed them; that after (being let out) they will come to the <HI>haunt,</HI> at the &s;ound of a Horn; But if they be out of hear|ing,
<PB N="14" REF="18">(they many times &s;u&s;pending all care of them for a week together) they goe out with three or four Dogs, that hunt them in; the whole Herd make|ing homewards &s;o &s;oon as ever the Dogs do <HI>Bay</HI> them; unto which <HI>di&s;ci|pline,</HI> if any of the Hogs be not con|formable, his refractorine&s;s co&s;t's him his life; his keeper (for example &s;ake) &s;carcely <HI>indemnifying</HI> him for the fir&s;t fault.</P>
<P>Thus two or three <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> &s;laves, (for a native <HI>Spaniard</HI> &s;corns the Em|ploy) will look to &s;ix or &s;even hun|dred Hogs, and provide them meat, not putting their Ma&s;ters to a penny charge.</P>
<P>Which cour&s;e may as effectually be managed upon <HI>Iamaica,</HI> in any part of the I&s;land; unparallel'd by any other <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> &s;ettlement in the more <HI>VVind|ward</HI> I&s;lands.</P>
<P>For a &s;tock of Sheep, Cows, Hor&s;es, Goats, and the like, there is excellent Pa&s;ture in the <HI>Savana's;</HI> &s;ome of them,
<PB N="15" REF="18">fourty, &s;ome fifty miles in circumfe|rence, wherein the gra&s;&s;e &s;prings fre&s;h and green all the year long.</P>

<P>In &s;o much as here is plenty of food to relieve the Planters Cattel through|out the year, needing no winter-<HI>hoard;</HI> The providence of the <HI>Ant</HI> being u&s;ele&s;&s;e here.</P>
<P N="2">2. Another &s;ingular benefit to the Planter, is the large numbers of <HI>wild Hor&s;es,</HI> well &s;hap'd and very &s;ervicea|ble, being all bred of the <HI>Spani&s;h Gen|nets,</HI> one of the&s;e tam'd and well ma|nag'd

<P N="3">3.

<P>But the <HI>Cacoa</HI> and <HI>Coco</HI> Nuts are Merchantable Commodities, enhan|ced for their &s;ingular u&s;e and de|light.</P>
