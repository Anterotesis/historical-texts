<HEAD>The Sea-wonder,</HEAD>
<P>_THat Antichri&s;t or the Pope is the Bea&s;t of <HI>Rome</HI> hath bin abundantly declared by all reformed Writers, but that this Bea&s;t is odious not only to men and Creatures on Earth, but even to the Fi&s;hes in the Sea, this age onely can give an illu&s;tration of it, and that in &s;uch a mira|culous manner as never age can produce the like. We will di&s;cribe unto you the full manner of it, and you &s;hall have it really and plainly related as we have recieved the truth from many who were the pre&s;ent Spectators of this wonderfull &s;ight, and we &s;hall de&s;ire onely from you but the gentlenes to receive it, and the credince to beleeve it.</P>
<P>On the 19 of <HI>October</HI> being the Lords Day the good Ship called the <HI>Bonaventure</HI> of <HI>Weymouth,</HI> being bound for <HI>England,</HI> was bring|ing home her Merchandize from <HI>France</HI> which was wines, linning cloath, and abundance of Wall-nuts, the day was very faire and no wind &s;tirring, &s;o that the Ship for above three houres &s;pace lay hull|ing upon the Seas, being not able to move either one way nor other for want of wind, although &s;he was full &s;ayled and prepared to take the advantage of every Gale Being put to &s;ome inconvenience by rea&s;on of this great Calme; the Sea-men for the pre&s;ent had nothing el&s;e to doe but to looke about them, many of them (as the manner is at Sea) wi&s;hing rather for a Tempe&s;t then being Wind-bound to &s;tare about them and do nothing when behold not farre from them they &s;aw a mighty rowling and working upon the water.</P>
<P>Amazed at the &s;trangene&s;&s;e of the &s;ight, they called unto one an|other, and were all come above Bord expecting what &s;hould occa&s;i|on
<PB N="4" REF="3">&s;o &s;trange a motion in the water, they found it to draw neerer to them, which made them the more eager to apprehend the cau&s;e, at length they perceived it to be a Whale, and that of no &s;mall pro|portion but (as it were the Leviathan of the Sea) to tran&s;cend all o|ther Whales in length and compa&s;&s;e.</P>
<P>The Whale made towards the Ship, which did put the Mariners into a great feare being not able to get from it, b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">t they perceived this Mon&s;ter of the Sea to come to them rather for refuge, then for offence, for they &s;aw it was followed by an infinite of Company of other Fi&s;h, as if all the Fi&s;hes of the Se<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter"> were in the pur&s;uance of it: There were to be &s;eene Fi&s;hes of all &s;orts, onely the Remora was ab|&s;ent, which the Seamen afterwards conceived was got under their Ship and &s;tayed it on purpo&s;e that they might be Spectators and the witne&s;&s;es of this &s;o wonderfull an object.</P>
<P>There was the Sword-Fi&s;h the Thorn-back armed with his prickles, the fayre Balena and the filthy Phocae, &amp; &s;uch a Fry of Sea-mon&s;ters (the old ones following after) is the like was never &s;eene nor can be repre&s;ented, but onely by tho&s;e men who were the Spectators of it.</P>
<P>In a mo&s;t violent manner they did beat again&s;t the Whale, make|ing a mo&s;t hideous and a fearful noy&s;e and falling upon her, &s;he made what ha&s;te &s;he could to get from them: &s;ome of the&s;e fi&s;hes were in one &s;hape, and &s;ome in another, but all mo&s;t wonderfull to be|hold, who in great fury did u&s;e what&s;oever weapons of offence that nature had afforded them to a&s;&s;ault this Whale.</P>
<P>Nay they were &s;o eager in their fight that &s;ome of them were often &s;een to leape above the water and as if by that they had gained an advantage of &s;trength, they did throw them&s;elves with greater rage again&s;t it, who being but one again&s;t &s;o many thou&s;ands, was not able to with&s;tand their fury, but making a mo&s;t terrible cry, did what &s;he could to come neere the Ship.</P>
<P>On this the amazed and di&s;tracted Seamen fearing that they &s;hould be drouned, di&s;charged divers of their Muskets again&s;t it,
<PB N="5" REF="3">which it &s;eemeth tooke effect, for pre&s;ently they found great &s;tore of Blood to di&s;colour the Sea, And the Whale which before &s;eemed to draw more neere the Ship for a &s;afety, did now &s;teere another cour&s;e through the bloody and foaming waters.</P>
<P>The infinite &s;holes of Fi&s;h which in incredible numbers did fol|low the Whale, were no way di&s;mayed at the noy&s;e of the Muskets nor at the fire which was given, but perceiving the wounded Whale to make away from the Ship in greedy throng they pre&s;&s;ed after it.</P>
<P>This made the Sea-men to wonder more, for many of them who&s;e names are &s;ub&s;cribed having bin often at Sea never behold the like thing before, nor never &s;aw &s;uch diver&s;ity of pertentous Fi&s;hes following troupes on troupes, one after another, as if they were in emulation who fir&s;t &s;hould exerci&s;e their greate&s;t fury and their revenge upon it.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides they doe profe&s;&s;e, that it did increa&s;e their won|der to &s;ee this conte&s;tation which is again&s;t the u&s;ual way of nature: It being common &amp; ordinary for the Whale to pur|&s;ue other Fi&s;hes and to devou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">e them, and not to &s;ee a mul|titude of other Fi&s;hes, (as if they were confederate all in one obligation) to pur&s;ue the Whale, and to do the utmo&s;t of their indeavour to de&s;troy it.</P>
<P>In this manner they followed the Whale, and u&s;ed what violence they could again&s;t it, as far as their eyes could reach, the Sea beating up and downe, and the waters labour|ing as they pa&s;&s;ed through them, yet &s;till in cholerick tu|mults pur&s;ued the cha&s;e, leaving a great trale upon the wa|ter, which for a long way was to be &s;eene behind them as they pa&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>By this the evening coming on, the wind did begin to ri&s;e which blowing from the South Ea&s;t was very welcome to the Sea-men, who making their be&s;t advantage of it, they came on the next morning being Munday <HI>Octob.</HI> 20. unto <HI>Weymouth.</HI></P>
<PB N="6" REF="4">
<P>At this Haven Towne they were no &s;ooner landed but they un|der&s;tood that a Whale of a mighty bignes was ca&s;t up, three miles from that place, who comming in with the tide and being &s;orely wounded with the Musket &s;hots, did make what ha&s;t &s;he could to land, and finding on the ebbing Sea, the tide to for&s;ake her, &s;he made a mighty roare that the noy&s;e thereof (as the Country people doe report) was heard two miles from it: on the next morning &s;he was found dead, like a mighty ruine lying all along upon the Shoare, the Country People comming from all places in multitudes to be|hold it.</P>
<P>On the <HI>Fryday</HI> following the&s;e Sea-men having di&s;pached their bu&s;ines at <HI>Weymouth,</HI> went nine of them together in one Company to &s;ee the Whale, and the rather becau&s;e they did truly conjecture it to be the &s;ame Whale which on <HI>Sunday</HI> before they &s;aw pur&s;ued by &s;uch mon&s;trous multitudes of Fi&s;hes, conceiving al&s;o that by rea&s;on of the many wounds &s;he received by the &s;hots from the Muskets that &s;he made ha&s;te to the next &s;hore to dye on, for the Whale, (al|though when &s;he is living will be covered with the Sea) yet when &s;he feeleth Death comming on, &s;he doth renounce to that watery Element and will admit to no other coverture then the wide Vault of Heaven.</P>
<P>The&s;e Mariners being come they &s;ound the Country people wery active in cutting up the Whale &s;ome bu&s;y on one part of the body, &s;ome on another, the better &s;ort &s;tanding by and wondering at the mighty compa&s;&s;e and proportion of it, and encouraging the Country people to proceed in their unaccu&s;tomed worke. The hone&s;t people partaked in the labour, the better &s;ort in the profit, and all in the greivou&s;ne&s;&s;e of the &s;mell which to &s;peake the truth was &s;o exce&s;&s;ive that if it be true Philo&s;ophy that a violent Subject or &s;en&s;ible doth de&s;troy the <HI>Sen&s;ory</HI> or &s;ence: It may be a que&s;tion whither the&s;e no&s;es can ever have the Capacity of &s;enting any thing that is &s;weet againe.</P>
<P>Had you beene there, you might have &s;eene <HI>Greenland</HI> at <HI>Wey|mouth,</HI> &s;uch a noy&s;e and a quarter they doe make when they doe hew the Whales in pieces in that Northern Climate, which is content for a whole yeare together, but with one night and with one day. Their &s;trength being lo&s;t with labour, and their &s;pirits with
<PB N="7" REF="4">the odious importunity of the increa&s;ing &s;avour which proceeded from the corruption of that mighty carka&s;&s;e, they relieve them|&s;elves according to the accu&s;tomed practice, with the &s;trength of hot waters: And now being armed again&s;t all ingredients of ill &s;a|vours they di&s;tribute the fi&s;h in prepared Cauldrons, which by the benefit of the fire mu&s;t be improved into oyle.</P>
<P>Though lucre is called filthy lucie, yet the &s;mell of it, is &s;aid, to be &s;weet being extracted out of the greate&s;t corruption what&s;oever: while the Labourers are boyling the fi&s;h, the Merchants are com|pounding for the &s;perme, or the &s;eed thereof: and this common|ly is called Parmacitie, &s;ome part thereof they de&s;igne to <HI>Falmouth,</HI> &s;ome part to <HI>Exeter,</HI> &s;ome part to <HI>VVeymouth,</HI> and very likely &s;ome part to <HI>Bristoll,</HI> and &s;ome part to <HI>London:</HI> But I would advi&s;e my friends in <HI>London</HI> (on any hand not to meddle with it, the rea&s;on whereof in the&s;e following Lines I &s;hall declare unto you.</P>
<P>For the belly of this Whale being opened, and the va&s;t ribs be|ing taken a&s;under, there was di&s;covered in the bowels of it a man, who it &s;eems had not long layne buried, for his head was &s;haven, he was &s;urely &s;ome Prie&s;t, and the haire on his Crowne &s;ince his death was not much growne forth. It doth appeare that he had re|mained &s;ome while alive in tho&s;e Chambers of death: for be&s;ides &s;ome papers that were found in a black leatheren Box, it appeares that hee had &s;ome papers to prove that there is a watery Purga|tory, of which I beleeve no man could ever give a more perfect te&s;timony then him&s;elfe when he was living in the belly of the Whale,</P>
<P>In this Box was found divers Pardons from the Pope for divers Papi&s;ts now in <HI>England,</HI> and in <HI>Ireland,</HI> as for <HI>Iohn Flower</HI> in <HI>Eng|land,</HI> and for one <HI>Humphrey Vaux</HI> (of kinne it is beleeved to that <HI>Guido Vaux,</HI> who would heve blowne up the Parliament Hou&s;e in the year 1605.</P>
<P>There were after this found divers Pardons for dives Papi&s;ts in <HI>Ireland,</HI> who have laboured to the uttermo&s;t of their endeavours to blow it up againe as to one <HI>Pre&s;ton,</HI> the &s;ame, who is now ex|pected to come over into <HI>England</HI> with Auxiliary forces from <HI>Ire|land</HI> with an exhortation al&s;o to him to proceed in the wars he hath undertaken, with the a&s;&s;urance of the Benediction of his Holines
<PB N="8" REF="5">of <HI>Rome.</HI> A Pardon for one <HI>Muskerry,</HI> a Pardon for one <HI>Oneale,</HI> for <HI>Mac Magennts,</HI> &amp; one for divers others, which was read by a Schol|lar, who was then pre&s;ent, as tho&s;e Sea-men have atte&s;ted, but being them&s;elves but unexperienced men in Letters, they are &s;orry they cannot deliver the particulars &s;o fully as they de&s;ire. It may evi|dently appeare, that the rea&s;on why this fi&s;h before &s;poken of in &s;uch mon&s;trous tumults did pro&s;ecute this Whale, was by rea&s;on of the per&s;on it interred, who it &s;eemes by &s;ome &s;hip-wrack was recei|ved into the belly of the Whale. You may &s;ee by this how &s;trong, and how deepe a dye, is the tincture of guilt which becau&s;e all the water of the Sea could not wa&s;h away from this man, the fi&s;hes would not endure their owne Element until they had expiated the Waves by the de&s;truction of the Whale that did receive him and intetre him, You may al&s;o &s;ee what a Sea of &s;in is in the &s;ea of <HI>Rome,</HI> the enlertainment whereof the fi&s;hes of the Sea would puni&s;h with death among&s;t the greate&s;t of their owne inhabitants the benefit whereof to di&s;&s;wade from Popery wil remaine to the&s;e pre&s;ent times, but the Wonder to al Po&s;terity.</P>
