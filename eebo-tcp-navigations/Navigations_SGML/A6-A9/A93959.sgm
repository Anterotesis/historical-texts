<HEAD>BLOODY NEWES FROM MINIARD.</HEAD>
<P>FIve Engli&s;h Prote&s;tants intending their journey for <HI>Ireland,</HI> purpo&s;ed to take &s;hip at <HI>Miniard,</HI> a place &s;ome 40. miles beyond the City of <HI>Bri&s;toll.</HI></P>
<P>After they had travelled above a hundred miles, with many a weary &s;tep, drawing nigh to <HI>Miniard,</HI> even within &s;ight of the town, though &s;carce to be di&s;cerned, in regard the day was &s;pent, and now one houre within night, they met with a company of Papi&s;ts, to the number of fifteen, every man with a good &s;word by his &s;ide, and a good cudgell in his hand. At the &s;ight of whom, they were &s;omewhat apal'd: yet tooke &s;ome courage, in regard they were not far off the Town, and thought that therefore they did not dare to offer them violence.</P>
<PB REF="3">
<P>But it fell out contrary to their expectation, For being met together, the event well &s;hewed that they had &s;ome ground and ju&s;t occa&s;ion of their feare. The fir&s;t &s;alutation was this, Gentle|men well met, pray from whence came you, and to what place do you travell: we ask not for any harm we mean to you, but only are de&s;irous to know. The&s;e were &s;mooth words you will &s;ay. Well, the poor men thought no hurt, for true Charity will favourably con&s;ter all things: and therfore plainly told them that they came out of <HI>Kent,</HI> and were going to <HI>Miniard,</HI> and &s;o they purpo&s;ed (if the wind &s;erved) to go for <HI>Ireland.</HI> To <HI>Ireland,</HI> &s;aid they, why? that is &s;trange you would go thither, knowing the e&s;tate of the king|dome, how all are up in arms, and the Prote&s;tants in fear to have their throats cut every hour; and now &s;eeing we know &s;o much, we wil under&s;tand before we part of what Religion you are; for we promi&s;e you, we may well &s;u&s;pect that you are not right: for there is &s;omething in the wind that moves you to go for <HI>Ireland,</HI> in a time &s;o dangerous, and trouble&s;ome. If it be &s;o, &s;aid the Prote&s;tants we are not a&s;hamed of our Religion we are (to tell you the truth) prote&s;tants, and go not to &s;ide with the Rebels, but to &s;ee &s;ome friends of ours in Dublin. What do you &s;ay, &s;aid they, do you call the Kings &s;ubjects rebels: by St. <HI>Peter,</HI> you are &s;ome of tho&s;e that would ba|ni&s;h us Papi&s;ts out of <HI>England,</HI> but wee will bee even with you ere we part: and &s;o drawing their
<PB REF="3">&s;words fell upon them, and bloudily &s;heath'd them in each mans bowels&punc; whil&s;t they pittiful|ly cryed out for mercy: but what mercy could be expected from men of bloud, who&s;e hearts were as hard as adamant, and their minds as cruel as <HI>Pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">gne,</HI> who bloudily &s;lew her own Son. The m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">rder done, a Gentleman on hor&s;eback riding by and &s;eeing &s;o pittifull an object, returned back to <HI>Miniard</HI> in &s;ight of the murderers, who would fain have taken him, if they could; and &s;o rai&s;ed the Country with all &s;peed, who tooke them in a wood, as they were at their Ori&s;ons on their beads. O how they looked then one upon another: what a &s;udden palene&s;&s;e came into their faces. All their devotion was gone in a moment, and they readier to take them to their heels, then pray a minute longer; knowing well enough, that it was but lo&s;t labour to implore the aid either of <HI>Peter</HI> or <HI>Paul.</HI> To be briefe, they were all car|ried to <HI>Bri&s;tow,</HI> and upon examination confe&s;&s;ed the deed, and &s;o were worthily adjudged to bee hang'd in chains the next Se&s;&s;ions, where we will leave them, and come to the Copy of a Letter which was found quilted in one of their dou|blets, not any of them knowing one word with|in it, el&s;e they would not &s;o carefully have pre|&s;erv'd it.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>MY LORD,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>MAy it plea&s;e your Grace to accept the&s;e poore impoli&s;hed lines of him that writes only of good will, earne&s;tly wi&s;hing an emendation of life, and re|formation of manners, then your Graces confutation; for it is the duty of every Chri&s;tian to imitate his Creator, not to delight in the blood of any man, but to pre&s;erve it.</P>
<P>But again <HI>(my Lord)</HI> as it is the part of a man to &s;upply the Corpor all wants of his indigent brother: &s;o e&s;pecially, he is bound to &s;upply the defects of the Mind, and to &s;tudy the welfare of the better part of man, his precious &s;oule, which after the fir&s;t death in a moment, either a&s;cends heaven, or de&s;cends hell.</P>
<P><HI>My Lord,</HI> it mu&s;t needs be a precious thing, when the whole world it &s;elf is not comparable to it. Were but this &s;eriou&s;ly dige&s;ted in the &s;tomacke of a &s;ound judgment, I beleeve the world like Rocks and Quick|&s;ands would not &s;o mi&s;erably &s;hipwrack &s;uch an infinit
<PB REF="4">number of mens &s;oules as it doth. Your Grace knowes that <HI>rebus &s;ecuudis omnes feri elati &s;nut,</HI> I will not &s;ay that your grace is &s;o; but I would de&s;ire your Grace to enter into a &s;erious Solilogue with your &s;elf, and to &s;ee whether it be &s;o or no; and if your Grace for the honour of this world, and outward pomp and glory, have not made &s;hipwrack of your Faith, and plea&s;ed man rather then God. No better time to bring a man home then that of affliction; for whereas Martyrs buy heaven, as <HI>Ignato</HI> &s;pake, with their blood, and others &s;teale it with their good deeds through Faith in Chri&s;t only, (as a learned Father &s;ometime &s;aid) a man in af|fliction is compelled to it.</P>
<P><HI>My Lord,</HI> remember <HI>Mana&s;&s;es,</HI> how hee prayed in pri&s;on, do you likewi&s;e. And for the world and Glory thereof, care not for it: remember that thrice Noble Emperor <HI>Henry</HI> the 4th. when his Crowne was taken from his head, &s;aw nothing but his <HI>Deus &V;ideat &amp; judicet.</HI> Let God &s;ee and judg. God grant us trea&s;ure in Heaven, where no Thiefe can approach. <HI>Amen.</HI></P>
