<HEAD>A true DESCRIPTION OF CAROLINA.</HEAD>
<P><HI>CArolina</HI> is part of the Main in <HI>America,</HI> and &s;o much celebrated by Mon&s;ieur <HI>Laudonere,</HI> that he entitles it <HI>Florida,</HI> becau&s;e of her florid, and fragrant Fields, imbelli&s;h'd with Flowers, that perfume the Air: who&s;e &s;weet Scitu|ations, by rea&s;on of mo&s;t delicious and plea&s;ant Meadows (and flouri&s;hing Savana's) adorn the Continent; and who&s;e benevolent Brea&s;t &s;ends daily Supplies to the Planter, and hourly Relief to the poor and nece&s;&s;itous Native: who&s;e &s;pacious Arms (as if circulating the Ocean) proclaims her Shores San|ctuary to di&s;tre&s;&s;ed Mariners; and a generous protection to deplorable Seamen, that &s;ollicit refre&s;hment from her repleni&s;h'd Harbours, which extend them&s;elves &s;outhward to the River St. <HI>Mattheo,</HI> &s;o dilates to <HI>Luck I&s;land,</HI> near <HI>Roanoack</HI> on the promontories of <HI>Virginia,</HI> in thirty &s;ix degrees North Latitude (now called <HI>Albemarle</HI>) a large and &s;pacious &s;ettlement con&s;i&s;ting of &s;ome two or three thou&s;and Inhabitants, upon a fertil Soil.</P>
<P>But the late and flouri&s;hing &s;ettlement lies yet more Southerly, in and about 32 Degrees, odd Minutes; parallel with <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> in <HI>Pale&s;tine:</HI> and equals the heighth of <HI>Bermudos,</HI> upon the navigable Rivers of <HI>Cooper,</HI> and <HI>A&s;hly;</HI> formerly known by the Names of <HI>Wando</HI> and <HI>Kiawah.</HI></P>
<P>This is that famous <HI>Carolina,</HI> which his Maje&s;ty the King of <HI>Great Britain</HI> has united to his Imperial Crown, and by his Royal Grant e&s;tabli&s;hed it a Province; and has dignified it a Principality: which by con&s;ent among&s;t the Lords is transferr'd to the elde&s;t Proprietor. But the Proprietors are eight in number, and their Names and Titles as followeth. Lord Chancellor <HI>Clarendon,</HI> Lord Duke <HI>Albemarle,</HI> Earl of <HI>Craven,</HI> Lord <HI>Anthony A&s;hly Cooper</HI> Earl of <HI>Shaftsbury, John</HI> Lord <HI>Berkley,</HI> Sir <HI>George Carteret,</HI> Sir <HI>William Berkley,</HI> and Sir <HI>John Colleton</HI> Kt. and Bar. The&s;e are the Lords Proprietors, who&s;e Laws and Government (becau&s;e to pro|ceed in my De&s;cription) is &s;u&s;pended till farther Opportunity pre&s;ents to u&s;her them in.</P>
<P>The Heavens &s;hine upon this famous Country the &s;overaign Ray of health; and has ble&s;t it with a &s;erene Air, and a lofty Skie, that defends it from noxious Infection; nor is there any known Di&s;temper incident to the Inhabitant whereby to terrify and affright him; who for the mo&s;t part lives by the Law of Plenty, extended to the utmo&s;t limits of Sanity.</P>
<P>Several Families have tran&s;ported them&s;elves from the Ports of <HI>Barbadoes,</HI> but what from the re&s;t of the <HI>Caribbies,</HI> I know not: yet am credibly inform'd (and from very good hands) that divers are gone, and going from thence: as al&s;o from <HI>New-Providence, Bermudus, New-York, New-Jer&s;ey, New-England, Long-I&s;land De-la-ware, Maryland</HI> and <HI>Virginia;</HI> but great num|bers
<PB REF="2">from <HI>Scotland,</HI> and &s;everal from the borders of <HI>Ireland:</HI> be&s;ides divers good Ships, with &s;ome eminent Families that are lately gone off from the Kingdom of <HI>England.</HI> Moreover, its a &s;alubrious Air to the &s;ick, and di&s;ea&s;ed; and a generous retirement to nece&s;&s;itous, and ab|ject Families; as al&s;o the a&s;&s;urance of &s;uch as &s;tudy to be rich: Engins &s;trong enough one would think to induce Mankind to hope the pro&s;perity of this famous Settlement.</P>
<P>But the &s;ettlement of <HI>Albemarle</HI> (otherwi&s;e called <HI>Roanoak</HI>) pre&s;ents fir&s;t to our view; and is the olde&s;t, and remote&s;t Northern County in the fair Province of <HI>Carolina;</HI> &s;cituated about 35 Degrees, and odd Minutes North Latitude: from who&s;e repleni&s;hed Meadows (as al&s;o from the more Southern Inhabitants) as good Beef, and Pork is &s;aved, and &s;ent off to <HI>Barbadoes,</HI> and other the <HI>Charibbee</HI> I&s;lands, as Art and Indu&s;try can husband.</P>
<P>Now <HI>A&s;hley</HI> County is yet more &s;outhward, and lies &s;cituated 32 degrees, 45 minutes; where the Setlers and Inhabitants toil not in Summer to accommodate them&s;elves with Win|ter's Provi&s;ion: becau&s;e hitherto they have con&s;idered it u&s;ele&s;s, and altogether unnece&s;&s;ary for the Planter to employ his Hands, and Strength, where Nature &s;o liberally &s;tocks them with Herbage: and the Winter, becau&s;e &s;o &s;oftned with a moderate Air, repre&s;ents it much of the ca&s;t and temperament with our <HI>March</HI> in <HI>England;</HI> and that's as much as to con&s;ider it the relique only of a mild and &s;hort Winter, or rather the &s;urprizal of an approaching Spring, that breaths forth to iniciate the Summer. And here it is that their Ships are built, and dre&s;t up by <HI>Bermudian</HI> hands, the mo&s;t approved Mariners; and a general Errour if not the be&s;t navigating Ships in <HI>America.</HI></P>
<P>And now by way of Advice, the fir&s;t thing requi&s;it and nece&s;&s;ary for the Setler to embrace, is to fell Timber, and to clear the Ground (which is rea&s;onably undertaken, as by an <HI>Ad|verti&s;ement</HI> in the la&s;t Paragraph) as &s;ome already have done, and planted <HI>Potatoes,</HI> the <HI>Ca&s;|&s;aida Root, Yams, Eddies, Carrots, Cabbidges, Onyons, Turnips, Par&s;nips, Shelots,</HI> (but they grow naturally there) <HI>Collyflowers, Artichokes, Musk-Melons,</HI> and <HI>Water-Melons;</HI> be&s;ides <HI>Wormwood, Nep, Scurvy-gra&s;s, Rue, Mead&s;weet, Trefoil, Cinquefoil, Elecampane, (Annis, Cububs,</HI> and <HI>Car|damome Seeds) Radi&s;hes,</HI> and <HI>Hor&s;e-Radi&s;hes, Mellelot, Angellica, Arch-Angel, Ro&s;emary, Thime, Lettice, Spinage, Sweetmarjarum,</HI> Summer, and Winter-<HI>Savory, Endive, Succory, Hopps, Water-Cre&s;&s;es, Cena,</HI> and <HI>China-Root,</HI> with other <HI>Druggs,</HI> and <HI>Saxafrage, Sa&s;&s;afras,</HI> and <HI>Sa&s;&s;aperrilla:</HI> be&s;ides divers other Vegitables without number.</P>
<P>Moreover, all &s;orts of <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Grane, as <HI>Wheat, Rye, Barley, Peas, Beans, Oates, Lentills, Fitches,</HI> and <HI>Indian</HI> Corn, with other <HI>European</HI> and <HI>American</HI> Roots, and Plants; which <HI>Carolina</HI> beyond di&s;pute with &s;mall indu&s;try will produce as large, and as good as the World has.</P>
<P>The next thing worthy our con&s;ideration, is their plentiful Eating; becau&s;e having their accommodation very cheap within them&s;elves; where Beef two years &s;ince was &s;old at 12 <HI>s.</HI> a 100, and Pork at the rate of 16 <HI>s.</HI> So that Cattel (you may read) begins to be plentiful, and Hoggs of a prodigious encrea&s;e. And mo&s;t of tho&s;e Cattel very fair, and large-headed Bea&s;ts, now grazing up and down in beautiful <HI>Savana</HI>'s, little or nothing inferiour to our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Meadows: there are &s;everal indu&s;trious Setlers, and Planters, that pro&s;per very well, tho not having much to begin with.</P>
<P>Moreover, there are Barrows (which by rea&s;on of the &s;uperabundant plenty of Ma&s;t, and Roots in tho&s;e parts) that &s;ome have weighed three or four hundred weight a-piece, and &s;uch had the Lady <HI>Yeomans,</HI> as I am credibly informed, who had 400 Hoggs in a Herd, and 500 Turkies in a Drove; be&s;ides Dunghil Fowls too numerous to relate without &s;u&s;pition. And which Plantation of hers, con&s;i&s;ting of 1500 Acres, was by the indu&s;try of one Mr. <HI>James Moore</HI> (an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Gentleman) cleared from Charge in &s;ome three years time, and with the
