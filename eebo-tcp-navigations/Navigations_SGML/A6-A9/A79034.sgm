<HEAD>The Scots Remon&s;trance or Declaration, for the re&s;toring their declared King to his ju&s;t Rights and Priviledges, and the rai&s;ing of an Army of 25000 men.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_SInce my arrivall in the&s;e parts, great hath been my de&s;ire to attend your motion, and to &s;alute you with tho&s;e Occurrences which are of greate&s;t concernment (being high|ly oblig'd unto you, for your for|mer manifold favours;) Your la&s;t of the 14th in&s;tant, &s;eeming to chal|lenge a return of &s;uch overtures; which (with an im|partiall pen) I &s;hall here repre&s;ent, de&s;iring they may &s;peedily ki&s;&s;e your hand, and not be concealed from publike view. On the 21 in&s;tant, the late Marque&s;&s;e of <HI>Montro&s;s</HI> received &s;entence of death, and the &s;ame day was brought to the place of execution (attend|ed by divers of the Nobility and Gentry) his gallant deportment, not a little amazing the Spectators; who after a &s;hort &s;peech, touching his engagement for his Soveraign, further declared, that if nothing would &s;atisfie the Parliament of <HI>Scotland</HI> but his bloud, that
<PB N="2" REF="3">it would be required again at their hands, and that he valued not his life in the lea&s;t, it being a debt that mu&s;t be paid; and that it did greatly comfort his dying &s;pirits, to think that he did not onely act, but was to &s;uffer for his Maje&s;ty; and &s;aid, if he had a hundred lives, he would freely &s;acrifice them all for his cau&s;e, prote&s;ting, he never took more delight in riding in a Coach to take his recreation in earthly plea&s;ures, then he did to ride to the place of execu|tion in a Cart, to be deprived of them. Which decla|ratory expre&s;&s;ion being ended, he pull'd off his Be|ver and gold hat-band, and ca&s;t it to a Gentleman &s;tanding by him, and lifting up his hands to heaven, de&s;ired the Executioner to proceed and do his Office, his &s;pirit not &s;eeming to be troubled, nor his coun|tenance to change, and his carriage as &s;weet as ever I &s;aw a mans in all my days. And truly, it is ab&s;olutely believed, that he hath gained a better repute among&s;t tho&s;e of his faction (by his death) then ever he did in his life. And after three hours hanging on the Gal|lows, his body was cut down, and his head &s;evered from his &s;holders, and &s;et upon the Tole-booth of this City, his arms and legs were likewi&s;e cut off and commanded to be &s;et upon four principle places of the Kingdom, which are &s;uppo&s;ed to be <HI>Aberdeen, Gla&s;cow, Sterling,</HI> and St. <HI>John&s;tons.</HI></P>
<P>This being performed, many of the royall-party &s;eemed very di&s;contented, threatning to be reveng'd, &amp;c. but it is believed, no &s;uch thing dare be attempt|ed, notwith&s;tanding the great activene&s;s of the Pre&s;|bytery in the North of <HI>Scotland,</HI> who have &s;et forth a declaration of their loyall integrity to their declared King, and of the carrying on the de&s;igne formerly in|tended
<PB N="3" REF="3">by the afore&s;aid Marque&s;s of <HI>Montro&s;s,</HI> prote&s;t|ing; That from their &s;ouls they abhor and dete&s;t, the delivering of the late King over to bondage, impri&s;on|ment, and murther; and that they will endeavour to e&s;tabli&s;h his pre&s;ent Maje&s;ty, in all his ju&s;t Rights and priviledges; and in order thereunto, the Mini|&s;ters in tho&s;e parts, preach very high in their pulpits, to &s;tir up their &s;everall Congregations to an engage|ment, again&s;t the Sectaries of both Kingdomes (as they are plea&s;ed to call them.) But what the event of the&s;e revolutions will be, few days will make mani|fe&s;t; It is conceived by many, that had not the blow been given in that nick of time, &s;ome &s;ad events would have attended the delay, which (in all probability) will now be prevented; for if Court &s;plendency, great mens deluding per&s;wa&s;ions, with de&s;igned Nationall advantages, do blinde the eys of the Church general, as wel as thus it did provincial, it may then be percei|ved, that it is not the name of Pre&s;bytery, that will keep con&s;cience un&s;tained, nor crooked turnings a&s;ide unbla&s;ted, as may be in&s;tanced by their late proceed|ings again&s;t tho&s;e that would not &s;ub&s;cribe to the a|fore&s;aid engagement, impri&s;oning tho&s;e that denied it.</P>
<P>Here is an Army rai&s;ing, by authority from the Committee of E&s;tates, the chief Officers have already received Commi&s;&s;ions, they intend to levy 20000 hor&s;e and foot, to be added to the old modell of 5000; and declare, that it is for the defence of their Country, but it is to be &s;u&s;pected, their de&s;igne is again&s;t <HI>Eng|land,</HI> whether &s;o or not, I am not able to re&s;olve; but I can a&s;&s;ure you, the <HI>Scots</HI> look upon a party in <HI>Eng|land,</HI> as a perfidious and Covenant-breaking people, and &s;ay, they are bound to maintain the &s;olemn league and Covenant.</P>
<PB N="4" REF="4">
<P>The Earl of <HI>Nauferling</HI> is returned from <HI>Breda,</HI> with a Copy of their young Kings Conde&s;cen&s;ions, which &s;eems &s;atisfactory to many; and there are thoughts among&s;t the great ones, of proclaiming him a new upon his arrivall; &s;ome giving out, that he is expect|ed about the 10th of <HI>june,</HI> but how true I know not: Others report, he is not to be received untill he hath &s;igned all the Articles, which it's believed, hee will not now &s;tick to do, con&s;idering the great blow gi|ven to <HI>Montro&s;s.</HI></P>
<P>We hear that he hath lately received a letter from the <HI>Queen</HI> his Mother; Wherein &s;he &s;eems to be &s;ome|what di&s;plea&s;ed at his Agreement with the <HI>Scots,</HI> and urgeth that he will be totally ruined thereby, for want of following her advice, and making good pro|vi&s;ion in behalf of the Roman Catholicks.</P>
<P>Divers Scotti&s;h &s;hips are already rigged, and ready to put forth to Sea, being well mann'd, and accom|modated with plenty of warlike provi&s;ion; they pre|tend (onely) to be for the guard of their own Seas, and to maintain their own intere&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">, but many con|ceive, that their de&s;igne is to attend the motion of their Land forces; who &s;ince the concluding of the Treaty at <HI>Breda,</HI> give out high &s;peeches; <HI>viz.</HI> That they hope that the Kingdome of <HI>Scotland</HI> will &s;oon be in a ca&s;e of re&s;toring their King to a flouri&s;hing condi|tion, if he will become a reformed Pre&s;byter. The Marque&s;&s;e of <HI>Argile</HI> &s;tands firm for the pre&s;ervation of the League and Amity between <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Scotland;</HI> and hath openly declared, that he will not be in&s;tru|mentall for the fomenting of new differences, &amp;c. which doth not a little retard the de&s;igne of the new modelling Army.</P>
<PB N="5" REF="4">
<P>Thus having in a brief and impartiall manner com|municated tho&s;e things that &s;eem to be of greate&s;t concernment; I de&s;ire to participate of your intelli|gence at <HI>London,</HI> and if I may not &s;eem to exceed the bounds of mode&s;ty in my reque&s;t, the continuance thereof will bee very acceptable to him, who re|mains</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THis morning we received an expre&s;&s;e from <HI>Pen|dennis</HI> in <HI>Cornwall,</HI> intimating, That the Lord <HI>Hopton</HI> had landed &s;ome forces in the I&s;land of <HI>Scilly,</HI> and that he had &s;ent a Letter, (with a Declaration en|clo&s;ed) to divers of the Gentry in <HI>Devon&s;hire</HI> and <HI>Corn|wall,</HI> &s;hewing the grounds and rea&s;ons of his pre&s;ent engagement, and that his chief aim and ends, tend to nothing el&s;e, but the advancement of his Maje&s;ties cau&s;e, and re&s;toring of the &s;ubject to his ju&s;t liberty and propriety, &amp;c. with many other fair glo&s;&s;es, in|termixed with &s;everall invectives again&s;t the pre&s;ent government and authority; and withall, de&s;ires them to
<PB N="6" REF="5">ca&s;t off their pre&s;ent yoak, and to remain no longer &s;ubject to their commands; And to the end that his advice might take the deeper impre&s;&s;ion upon them, he di&s;patched &s;everall Agents to <HI>Cornwall</HI> and <HI>Devon|&s;hire,</HI> for the di&s;per&s;ing of the&s;e papers among&s;t the in|habitants, and to withdraw and alienate their tender affections from the pre&s;ent Government and Autho|rity of the Nation; but in the execution thereof, &s;ome of them were apprehended, and by the great vigilancy of Sir <HI>Hardre&s;s Waller,</HI> the plot was di&s;covered; which otherwi&s;e, in few days might have proved of dange|rous con&s;equence to the Republique, by rea&s;on of the great forwardne&s;s of many, in under-hand and pri|vate li&s;tings: Which de&s;igne not taking effect, it is &s;aid, that the Inhabitants in tho&s;e parts are now re|&s;olved to &s;tand firm to the pre&s;ent power and Autho|rity, and to live and dye with them, in the pre&s;erva|tion and &s;afety of <HI>Englands</HI> liberty, again&s;t all former oppo&s;ition what&s;oever.</P>
