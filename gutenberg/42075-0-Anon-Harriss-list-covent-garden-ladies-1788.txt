INTRODUCTION.


   Again the coral berry'd holly glads the eye,
   The ivy green again each window decks,
   And mistletoe, kind friend to _Bassia_'s cause,
   Under each merry roof invites the kiss;
   Come then, my friends, ye friends to _Harris_ come,
   And more than kisses share, drink love supreme
   From his ambrosial cup, tho' oft replete
   Satiety ne'er gives, but leaves the ravish'd sense
   Supremely blest, and ever craving more.
   Come ye gay sons of pleasure, come and feast
   Your _every_ sense, and lave your souls in love,
   Fearless advance, nor think of ills to come;
   Here taste variety, of love's sweet gifts,
   Pure and unstain'd as at kind nature's birth.


THE parterre of Venus was never
more elegantly filled, never did
the loves and graces shine, with more
splendor than at present; Marylebone,
the now grand paradise of love, and
Covent Garden, her elder born, beam
with uncommon ardor; nor is our
antient Drury unfrequented; no sooner
do the stars above shed their benign in-
fluence, but our more attracting ones
                                below

               [ 14 ]

below bespangle every walk, and make
a heaven on earth; Bagnigge, St. George's
Spa, with all their sister shops, deal
out each night their choiceft gifts of love;
nor with the sons of pleasure be dis-
appointed should they extend their travels
still farther east, and visit the purlieus
of White Chapel.  The Royalty is
over full, and Wapping, Shadwell, and
the neighbouring _fields_ lend all their
lovely train to glad each night; these
then shall be our walks; from these gay
spots of pleasure shall we call love's
purest sweets,

         And without thorn the rose.

   By thus extending our researches we
shall be able to suit every constitution,
and every pocket, every whim and
fancy that the most extravagant sensua-
list can desire.	Here may they learn to
shun the dreadful quicksands of pain and
mortification, and land safe on the terra
firma of delight and love.

    HARRIS's LIST

         OF

COVENT-GARDEN LADIES

___________________________________


Miss L--st--r, No. 6, _Union-Street,
       Oxford-Road_.

   Oh, pleasing talk, to paint the ripen'd charms
   Of youth untutor'd in the female arts;
   To see instinctively desire blaze out,
   And warm the mind with all its burning joys.
   The _tell-tale eyes_ in liquid pools sustain'd,
   The throbbing breast now rising, now suppress't;
   The _thrilling bliss_ quick darting thro' the frame,
   The _short fetch'd sighs_, the snow white twining
        limbs,
   The sudden gush, and the extatic oh.

SUCH our all pleasing L--st--r
leads the train, and, smiling like
the morn, unfolds her heaven of beauties.
Oh, for a _Guido's touch_, or _Thomson's
                                thought_,

               ( 16 )

thought_, to paint the richness of her
unequall'd charms; every perfection
that can possibly adorn the face and
mind of Woman seem centered in this be-
witching girl; hither resort then, ye
genuine lovers of beauty and good
sense; here, whilst _Plutus_ reigns, may
you revel nor know satiety; here feast
the longing appetite, and return with
fresh _vigor_ to every _attack_. Now arrived
at the tempting age of nineteen, her ima-
gination is filled with every luscious
idea, _refined_ sensibiiity, and _fierce desire_
can unite, her form is majestic, tall, and
elegant; her make truly genteel, her
complexion

   -----As April's lily fair,
   And blooming as June's brightest rose.

Painted by the masterly hand of nature,
shaded by tresses of the darkest brown,
and enlivened by two stars that swim in
all the essence of unsatiated love.

   Her pouting lips distil nectarious balm,
   And thro' the frame its thrilling transports
      dart;

which, when parted, display a casket
of snow white pearls, ranged in the nicest
regularity, the _neighbouring hills_ below
                                      full

               ( 71 )

full ripe for manual pressure, firm, and
elastic, and heave at every touch. The
_Elysian font_, in the centre of a _black be-
witching grove_, supported by two pyra-
mids white as alabaster, very delicate,
and soft as turtle's down. At the _approach_
of their _favourite lord_ unfold, and for
three guineas he is conducted to this
_harbour_ of never failing delight. Add
to all this, she sings well, is a very
chearful companion, and has only been,
in _life_ nine months.

___________________________________


Miss H--ll--nd, No. 2, _York-Street,
           Queen-Ann-Street_.

   No time shall pass without that dear delight,
   I'll talk of love all day, and aca it all the night;
   Pleasure and I as to one goal design'd,
   Will run with equal pace, while sorrow lays
         behind.

   Those who choose to sail the island
of love in a _first rate_ ship, or to enclose
an armful of delight, must be pleased
with this lady; who, tho' only seventeen
and short, is very fat and corpulent;
yet, notwithstanding, she is a fine piece
of frailty; her face is handsome and
                                 her

               ( 18 )

her _nut brown locks_, which are placed
_above_ and below, promise a luscious
treat to the voluptuary. Her temper is
agreeable and pleasing, and she is so far
from being mercenary, that a single
guinea is the boundage of her wish.

___________________________________

Miss B--rn, No. 18, _Old Compton
          Street, Soho_.

   Close in the arms she languishingly lies,
   With dying looks, short breath, and wishing
       eyes.

This accomplished nymph	has just
attained her eighteenth year, and fraught
with every perfection, enters a volunteer
in the field of Venus. She plays on the
piano forte, sings, dances, and is mistress
of every _Manoeuvre_ in the amorous contest
that can enhance the coming pleasure;
is of the middle stature, fine auburn
hair, dark eyes, and very inviting
countenance, which ever seems to beam
delight and love. In bed she is all the
heart can wish, or eye admire, every
limb is symmetry, every action under
cover truly amorous; her price is two
pounds two.

                                 Miss

               ( 19 )

Miss J--ns--n, No 17, _Goodge Steet,
           Charlotte Street_.

   And all these joys insatiably to prove,
   With which rich beauty feasts the glutton love.

The raven coloured tresses of Miss
J--ns--n are pleasing, and are charac-
teristics of strength and ability in the
wars of Venus. Indeed this fair one is
not afraid of work, but will undergo a
great deal of labour in the action; she
sings, dances, will drink a chearful glass,
and is a good companion. She has such
a noble elasticity in her loins, that she can
cast her lover to a pleasing height, and
receive him again with the utmost dex-
terity. Her price is one pound one, and
for her person and amorous qualifications
she is well worth the money.

___________________________________

Miss L--v--r, No. 17, _Ogle Street,
       Queen Ann-Street East_.

   She darted from her eyes a side long glance
   Just as she spoke, and, like her words, it flew,
   Seem'd not to beg, what yet she bid to do.

This young nymph of fifteen is
short, of a dark complexion, and inclin-
                                    able

               ( 20 )

able to be lusty; she does not rely on
_chamber practice_ only, for she takes her
evening excursions to seek for _clients_, who
may put their case to her either in a ta-
vern or her own apartments; her fee is
from a crown to half a guinea, and she
strives to earn her money by seeming to
be agreeable; however, she may please
some, and as we have only known her
about four months she cannot have lost
her _appetite_, but seems particularly fond
of the sport.

___________________________________

Miss L--ns--y, No. 13, _Bentick Street,
            Berwick Street_.

   Close in the arms she languishingly lies,
   With dying looks, short breath, and swimming
          eyes.

To all lovers of carrots we would re-
commend this fair complex, and blue ey'd
nymph; she is now steering into the
nineteenth year, and has very little of the
vulgarity too often found in the sister-
hood, but would be rather silent than
speak nonsense: the mere sensualist will
not find her quite to his fancy, but she
will please the delicate and sensible, who
                                       can

               ( 21 )

can spend the dull pause of joy with her
agreeably, till call'd by nature to repeti-
tion; in which, as well as in conservation,
we are informed she is equally charming.

___________________________________


Miss H--rd--y, No. 45, _Newman Street_.

   Her look serene does purest softness wear,
   Her face exclaims her fairest of the fair.

This lady borrows her name from her
late keeper, who is now gone to the In-
dia's, and left her to seek support on the
wide common of independence; she is
now just arrived at the zenith of perfec-
tion, devoid of art and manners, as yet
untutor'd by fashion, her charms have for
their zest every addition youth and sim-
plicity can add. She has beauty with-
out pride, elegance without affectation,
and innocence without dissimulation;
and not knowing how long this train of
perfections will last, we would advise
our reader to make hay whilst the sun
shines.


                                 Miss


               [ 22 ]

Miss Br--wn, No. 8, _Castle-Street,
         Newman-Street_.

   Her every glance, like Jove's vindictive flame,
   Shoot thro' the veins, and kindle all the frame.

A peculiar elegance in make and taste
in dressing distinguishes this daughter of
love; her shape is remarkably genteel,
and her figure good; she sings a good
song and is a chearful _bon_ companion;
her complexion is fair, her eyes, though
grey, exceedingly melting, and seem to
speak the disposition of the parts below
very forcibly, and if you would wish to
find a good bed-fellow, tho' not blest
with every other perfection, this lady
will perhaps suit her price, which is two
pounds two.

___________________________________


Mrs. T--rb--t, No 25, _Titchfield-Street_.

  The glow of youth, the fire of wanton love,
  Sport in her eye, and rouse the sensual heart
  To strong desires unmanageable pitch.

So universally known, and so great a
fav'rite with the bucks is this lady, that
her desription is almost needless; her
eyes And hair are of the most inviting
                             darkness,

               [ 23 ]

darkness, her temper and disposition
good, and her mind replete with the
choicest gifts of _Minerva_; her figure is
elegant, she is very tall, sings and dances
to perfection, and has only been in a
_public_ way of life twelve months; for a
single skirmish she does not refuse the
King's smallest picture, but for a whole
night's siege expects three of the largest.

Miss R--ch--rds--n, No. 2 _Bennett-
       Street, Rathbone-Place_.

  If women were as little as they are good,
  A peas cod would make them a gown and a
      hood.

A pretty, little, lively, fair complex-
ioned girl, with a dainty leg and foot,
and as pretty a pair of pouting bubbies
as ever went against a man's stomach,
and one who well deserves the attention
that is paid her by every man capable of
knowing her value. She is pleasing,
though fond, and can make wantonness
delightful; every part assists to bring on
the momomentary delirium, and then each
part combines to raise up the fallen mem-
ber, to contribute again to repeated
rapture; her price is commonly two gui-
                                  neas,

               [ 24 ]

but if a man is clever, she is very
ready to make some abatement.

Miss L--c--s, No. 1 _York-Street,
       Queen-Ann-Street East_.
  -----------Lilting o'er the lea,
  Ye're welcomer to take me, than to let me be.

She is tall and fair, of a striking figure,
and amiable in conversation, perfectly
complying with the desires of her ena-
morato's: she is said, like the river
Nile, frequently to overflow, but some-
how or another her inundations differ
from those of that river, as they do not
produce foecundity, some skilful gar-
deners are of opinion that she drowns
the _seed_, which is the reason that it does
not take root. This, is a disagreeable
circumstance to those who may wish not
to till in vain; but to others who would
prefer the pleasure without the expensive
consequences, she is the more desirable,
as they are sure that all who bathe in her
_Castalian spring_, will be overwhelmed
with a flood of delight.


                                   Mrs.

               ( 25 )

Mrs. Cr--sby, No, 24, _George Street,
over Black Fryars Bridge_.

Fast lock'd in her arms,
And enjoying her charms,
Every frown of old care I'll defy;
Give desire such a loose,
That the all potent _Juice_,
Shall pervade ev'ry sense, and swim in each
Eye.

Birmingham lays claim to the birth of
this daughter of love, and, under the
care and protection of an indulgent
father and mother, she reached her
fifteenth year " pure and unsullied;"
at this period nature began to be very
bay with Nancy, and a strong propen-
sity for seeing _Life_, compelled her to
leave her parents and enter into servitude,
and being particularly attached to the
sons of Neptune, she chose for her
master a sea captain, whose name she
still prefers to any other. A twelve
month had not elapsed in the captain's
service before our charmer's feelings had
reached their highest pitch, and the
captain, blest with a keen appetite, after
a six months voyage, with little persua-
sion, opened her _port hole_, cleared her
_gangway_, and threw her virtue _overboard_.
                                          He

               ( 26 )

He grew strongly attached to her, and,
being a man rather advanced in years,
became contented and happy, nor
wished for any other but his dear Nancy.
She was his own, and he was all she at
that time wished or desired for; one or
two little prattlers were pledges of their
mutual regard, and till the day of the
captain's death they lived " the happy
pair." It is near two years since she
lost her friend, by whose death she
receives a little annuity, that will ever
keep her from the necessity of parading
the streets _merely_ for support, and you
are certain to meet with her at home at
almost any hour of the day; in the
evening the generally visits one of the
Theatres, and always sits in the side
boxes, in which place she contrives to
chuse her spark, and if possible to take
him home with her (for she never sleeps
out,) where he will meet with snug com-
fortable apartments, civility, good hu-
mour, and a very engaging partner,
whilst she continues good humoured; if
he uses any language or behaviour to
ruffle her temper, she can act the Virago
as well as most of her sex. She is rather
below mediocrity in size, with dark hair,
flowing in ringlets down her back,
                       languishing

               ( 27 )

languishing grey eyes, and a very toler-
able complexion, and a pair of pretty
little firm _bubbies_.	Her leg and foot is
particularly graceful, always ornamented
with a white silk stocking, and a neat
shoe; she is a loving bed-fellow, and
sincerely _attaches_ herself to the enjoyment,
feels the thrilling sensation with poig-
nancy, and for one guinea will _enjoy_ you
as many times as you please.

N. B. She keeps the house, and you
must not mention to her a syllable con-
cerning her pretty lodger _above_, if you
wish to be calm _below_.

Miss Harriet J--n--s, _St. George's
Hotel, opposite Virginia Street, Wapping_.

   For lips to lips, and Tongue to Tongue,
   Will make a man of sixty young.

Yes, 'tis Harriet, the	fair, still
blooming Harriet, whose eyes are
molded for the tender union of souls (let
them but borrow a little fire from
Bacchus) "by Heaven's, shoot Suns"
whose nectar-distilling lips pour sweetest
balm; whilst the soft silent lingual inter-
course shoots powerfully through all the
                                  frame,

               ( 28 )

frame, and awakes each dormant sense.
When naked she is certainly Thomson's
Lavinia.

             For loveliness,
   Needs not the foreign aid of ornament,
   But is, when unadorned, adorned the most.

A beautiful black fringe borders the
_Venetian Mount_, and whether she pursues
the _Grahamatic_ method from a practical
knowledge of its increase of pleasure,
from motives of cleanliness, or as a cer-
tain preventative we will not pretend to
say; but we well know it makes her the
more desirable bed-fellow, and after
every _stroke_ gives fresh _tone and vigour_ to
the lately _distended parts_; her legs and
feet claim her peculiar attention, nor do
their _coverings_ ever disgrace their owner,
nor their actions under _cover_ ever do
injustice to that dear delightful spot they
are doomed to support, protect, and pay
just obedience to; _the eager twine_, the
almost unbearable press at the _dye away
moment_, with all _love's_ lesser _Artillery_, she
plays off with uncommon activity and
ardor, and drinks _repetition_ with thirst
insatiable. Half a guinea, and a new
pink ribband to encircle her bewitching
brows, is the least she expects for a night's
                               entertainment.

               ( 29 )

entertainment. There are three or four
more ladies of _our_ order in the house, if
this lady should not exactly suit.

   But being blest with beauty's potent spell,
   Must from her other sisters bear the bell.

Miss W--lk--ns--n, No. 10, _Bull-and-
Mouth Street_.

   Forbidding me to follow she invites me,
   This is the mould of which I made the sex,
   I gave them but one tongue to say us nay,
   And two kind eyes to grant.

Here we present our readers with as
pretty a man's woman as ever the
bountiful hand of nature formed; a
pair of black eyes that dart resistless fire,
that speak a language frozen hearts
might thaw, and stand as the sweet index
to the soul; a pair of sweet pouting
lips that demand the burning kiss, and
never receives it without paying with
interest; a complexion that would charm
the eye of an anchorite; a skin smooth'
as monument alabaster, and white as
Alpian snow; and hair that so beauti-
fully contrasts the skin, that nought
but nature can equal. Descend a little
lower and behold the semi-snow-balls.
                              "Studded

               ( 30 )

  "Studded with role buds, and streaked
   with celestial blue,"

that want not the support of stays;
whose truly elastic state never suffers the
pressure, however severe, to remain, but
boldly recovers its tempting smoothness.
Next take a view of nature centrally;
no _folding lapel_, no _gaping orifice_, no
_horrid gulph_ is here, but the _loving lips_
tenderly kiss each other, and shelter
from the cold a small but easily stretched
passage, whose _depth_ none but the _blind
boy_ has liberty to _fathom_; between the
_tempting lips_ the _coral headed tip_ stands
centinal, sheltered by a _raven coloured-
bush_, and for one half guinea conduct
the _well erected friend_ safe into _port_.
She is a native of Oxfordshire, and has
been a visitor on the town about one
year, is generally to be met with at home
at every hour excepting ten at night, at
which time she visits a favourite gentle-
man of the Temple.

Mis N--ble, No. 10, _Plough Court,
           Fetter Lane_.

           She darted a sweet kiss,
   The wanton prelude to a farther bliss;
   Such as might kindle frozen appetite,
   And fire e'en wasted nature with delight.

She is really a fine girl, with a lovely
fair complexion, a most engaging be-
haviour and affable disposition. She
has a most consummate skill in reviving
the dead; for as she loves nothing but
active life, she is happy when she can
restore it: and her tongue has a double
charm, both when speaking and when
silent; for the tip of it, _properly applied_,
can talk eloquently to the heart, whilst
no sound pervades the ear and send such
feelings to the central spot, that imme-
diately demands the more noble weapon
to _close_ the _melting scene_.

   Oh! the transporting joy!

her vivid eyes, speak the liveliness of her

               ( 32 )

disposition, and the joy she conceives in
the hour of bliss. As yet she hath not ap-
proached the verge of satiety; she is not
so hackneyed in the ways of man as to be
merely passive, she enjoys the	pleasure,
and though she is very fond of a _noun
substantive_ that can _stand_ by itself, yet she
loves to make it _fall_, and indeed the
stoutest man cannot _stand_ long before
her; many a _fine weapon_ she has made
a _mere hanger_ and the most stubborn steel
hath melted in her _sheath_; yet no one
complains, but rather rejoices at the de-
bility she produces, and wishes for repe-
tition which she enjoys with a _gou_ peculiar
to herself, and is possessed of every _amo-
rous_ means to produce it, as she is of
every luscious one to destroy it.--To be
met with at any of the genteel houses
about St. James's.

   Soft, as when the wooing dove,
      Woo's his mate in vernal bowr's,
   Is this purest child of love,
      When she her _choicest treasure pours_.

   Here youth and beauty are combined,
and unadorned by education or art; what
she _feels_ in the _amorous encounter_ cannot
be feigned. Her natural simplicity is
yet so unstained, and her knowledge of
the world so very little, that it is almost
impossible for her to dissemble; her
hair, eye-brows and eyes, are of the
deepest black; her complexion of the
roses red, and her neck and breasts of
                                   the

               ( 35 )

the purest white; her limbs are nobly
formed, every joint possessing the most
enchanting flexibility, which she mana-
ges with uncommon dexterity, and her
_Venus Mount_ is so _nobly fortified_, that she
has no occasion to dread the _fiercest at-
tack_, nor does she: and although she is
obliged to make sudden _retreats_, her _ad-
vances_ follow so very brisk, and are so
effectual, that

   Whene'er she quits the field,
   Waits _vice_ on her _lovely shield_.

but we must advise our lovers of the sport
to keep her pleased, as her temper, a
little different from _another part_, is not
to be sported with.

   Like some fair flower, whose leaves all co-
       lours yield,
   And opening, is with rarest odours fill'd;
   As lofty pines o'ertop the lowly reed,
   So does her graceful height most nymphs ex-
      ceed.

   Miss S--ms is fair and tall, and if
well paired, would be a very proper
                              mould

               ( 36 )

mould to cast grenadiers in; she is about
twenty, and though rather above the
common heighth, is not ungraceful nor
awkward. She knows her value, and
will seldom accept of less than two
guineas, which indeed, are well be-
stowed. It is remarkable, that her lovers
are most commonly of a diminutive size.
The vanity of surmounting such a fine
tall woman, is, doubtless, an incentive to
many, to so unmatch themselves, that
they are content to be like a sweet-bread
on a breast of veal. Yet, notwithstand-
ing her size, we hear her _low countries_
are far from being capacious, but like a
well made boot, is drawn on the _leg_ with
some difficulty, and _fits so close_, as to give
great pleasure to the wearer; it is about
two years since her _boot_ has been ac-
customed to wear legs in it, and though
often _soaled_, (sold) yet never wears out.

sent reigning lover of the sport; she is
rather above mediocrity in height and
size, with fine dark hair, and a pair of
bewitching hazel eyes; very agreeable
and loving, but she is not so unreasonable
as to expect constancy; it is a weak un-
profitable quality in a woman, and if she
can persuade her husband or keeper that
she has it, it is just the same as though
she really possessed it. Miss B--lt--n
is conscious she loves variety, as it con-
duces both to her pleasure and interest;
and she gives each of her gallants the

never lessens the fill of joy, by any real
or affected freaks of jealousy; when her
lovers come to her, they are welcome,
and they are equally so when they fly to
another's arms. Indeed, when they do
so, it is generally to her advantage, as
she finds they return to her with re-
doubled ardour, and her charms are in
general more dear, from a comparison
with others; and although her age is
bordering upon twenty-four, and she has
been a traveller in our	path four years,
her desires are not the least abated, nor
does she set less value on herself.

Miss D--v--np--rt, No 14, _Lisle-street,
             Leicester-fields_.

   The nymphs like Nereids round her couch
       were plac'd,
   Where she another sea-born Venus lay;
   She lay and lean'd her cheek upon her hand,
   And cast a look fo languishingly sweet,
   As if secure of all beholders hearts,
   Neglecting she could take 'em.

   This young charmer, for she is not
yet past the bloom of eighteen, has so
beautiful a face, that though here and
there the general ravager of beauty has
left his dented marks in a skin, that the
finest tints of the tulip, carnation, or
rose, blended with the hue of the fairest
lily, cannot equal, (so vastly superior is
the vermilion tinge of nature, in this her
choicest and most animated work over
all other) yet their effect is rather pleas-
ing than otherwise; and perhaps have
tempered a blaze of beauty, which with-
out them would have been insupportable.
Her eyes are of that colour, which the
celebrated Fielding has given the heroine
ofhis most admirable work, and which
                                dart

               ( 39 )

dart a lustre peculiar to themselves.
From such an eye each look has power
to raise

  "The loosest wishes in the chastest heart,"'

and melt the soul to all the thrillings of
unasked desire, till quite overpowered
with the transporting gaze, the senses
faint, and hasten to enjoyment. Her
hair is also black, of which great orna-
ment, nature has been lavishly bountiful,
for when loose, it flows in unlimited
tresses down to her waist; nor are the
_tendrills_ of the _moss covered grotto_ thinner
distributed, but though not yet _bushy_,
might truly be stiled _Black Heath_; how
early this _thicket_ of her maidenhead _was
penetrated_ through, by the natural invader
of _Middlesex_, we cannot pretend to say;
moft probably when it was only
a small brake; for from its present
state, and the extraordinary warmth
of the soil, it must have began to shoot
very early, and the mother of all things
must have opened the sanguinary sluices
in this delightful _Channel_, at an early
period. The mount above, has a most
delicious swell, as ambitious to receive
on it downy bed, its _swelling rival_and
                             _antagonist_

               ( 40 )

_antagonist_, and it is so well clothed, that
it may be justly called the Cyprian
Grove; whilst her breasts are so fine and
so fully shaped, as to entitle her to be
stiled _en bon point_, in the richest sense of
the words, and they have a springinness
that defies any weight whatever, of amo-
rous pressure.	Here the voluptuary
might revel in	pleasure, better imagined
than described, in

     "Soft silent rapture and extatic bliss."

Her teeth are remarkably fine; she is
tall, and so well proportioned (when you
examine her whole naked figure, which
she will permit you to do, if you per-
form Cytherean Rites like an able priest)
that she might be taken for a fourth
Grace, or a breathing Animated Venus
de Medicis. Her disposition and tem-
per is remarkably good, so sweet that it
is your own fault if it be soured;
for she is possesed of an uncommon
share of politeness, nothing rude or un-
courteous in her manner, but abounding
with civility and good breeding; her
connections are good, and she has a
keeper (a Mr. H--nn--h) both kind
                              and

               ( 41 )

and liberal; notwithstanding which, she
has no objection to two supernumerary
guineas.

   Hast thou beheld a fresher, sweeter nymph,
   Such war of white and red upon her cheeks,
   What stars do spangle, Heaven, with so much
      beauty,
   As those two eyes become that Heav'nly face.

   At the tempting luscious age of nine-

with light brown hair, which waves in
many a graceful ringlet, has good teeth,
and her tell-tale dark eyes, speak indeed,
the tender language of love, and beam
unutterable softness; she is tall of stature;
and of the moft tempting _en bon point_;
plump breasts, which in whiteness sur-
pass the driven _snow_, and melt the most

about six months ago, to seek support in
this grand mart of pleasure; and as she

   Sooths every sense, does with each with
        comply;
   But false enjoyment the kind guide destroys,
   We lose the passion in the treacherous joys.

   Enjoyment is the most exquisite of
human pleasures; ah! what a pity it is
so short in duration. Nature wound up
to the highest pitch, after striking _twelve_,
immediately descends to poor solitary
_one_: these are the reflections that na-
turally arise on enjoying Betsy. Though
she is but little, she is an epitome of de-
light, a quintescence of joy, which by the
most endearing chemistry, give all spirit,
and unite in small compass, the efficacy
of a much larger bulk. Her lovely fair
tresses and elegant countenance beat
alarms to love; but we attack only to
fall in the breach, and lament that the
                               luscious

               ( 44 )

luscious conflict is so soon ended. The
common destroyer of beauty has made a
few dells on the face of this fair Jewess,
but a pair of pretty dimples makes ample
amends, and quite over balances these
trifling imperfections; she has been in
life not more than six months, and ex-
pects, if she calls any man a friend,
to receive two guineas the first visit.

   How dull the spring of life would prove,
   Without the kiss that waits on love;
   From youthful lips you soon receive
   The richest harvest lips can give.

   Eloped from her friends in the country
but a short time, flushed with all the
amorous fire of youth insatiate, and ripe
with every personal charm the heart of
man can wish, this pleasing girl enters
our list. The fresh country bloom still
remains unimpaired, the rural vivacity is
still the same, and united with a beauti-
ful skin and complexion, we can present
our readers with a temper and disposition
that good nature and affability must call
their own. Her teeth are regular, and
very white, her eyes of the most lively
hazel, which, without the least fire from
Bacchus, shoot the most powerful glances;
her hair a lovely brown, her breasts are
small and never have been sufficiently
subjected to manual pressure to deprive
them of their natural firmness; she is
willingly compliant to any liberty in
company, that does not extend beyond
the bounds of decency; but let nature
                                 come

            ( 46 )

come forth _unadorned_, get once the
enchanting girl in bed, she _opens_ all her
charms, and gives a sudden loose to such
a bent of amorous passion, she would fire
the most torpid dispolition; when once
you press her in your eager arms the
game must instantly begin, and scarcely
does she allow an introductory kiss, so
uncurbed is her appetite, and so fond is
she of _repetition_, that she would with
every lover that passes a night with her
to be able to say with Ovid,

   Fair Betsy knows, when numbering the delight
   Not less than _nine_ full tranfports crown'd the
       night.

Only six months has this child of love
dealed out her charms in public, but well
knowing their value, is not quite satisfied
if she does not receive on _paper_ a proof

_stopping_, and is full as well skilled in
_pricking_; altho' the principal part of her
_music_ is played in _duets_, and every _duet_
in a _natural key_, she has not the smallest
objection to _two flats_; she has a variety
of sweet notes, and many pleasing _airs_,
and generally chooses the lowest part;
every _shake and quaver_ she feels in-
stinctively, and sometimes has played the
same _tune_ over _twice_, before her partner
has gone through it once, without the
least deviation from true concord; she
does not allow of any _cross barrs_, and is
particularly partial to the _Tacit_ flute;
her moving stars are as black and as
round as the end of a _Crotchet_; no _flower
that blows is like_ her cheek, or _scatters such
perfume_ as her breath: no _advice can
controul her love; she does as she will with
her swain_, presses him _away to the copse_,
puts the _wanton God where the bee sucks into
her pleasant native plains_, soon after you
feel the _graceful move_ and find _how sweet
it is in the low-lands_; and should it be _in
sable night, she loves to restore the drooping
plant_, thinks _variety is charming_, and
always _gives one kind kiss before she parts_;
                                           and

               ( 49 )

and as she is now only nineteen, can sing
a French as well as an English song, and
has a very good friend, whose name she at
present assumes: you must not approach
her shrine without being well fortifyed
with _root of all evil_.

Miss B--nd, No. 28, _Frith-Street_.

   A rose-bud blows in either cheek,
     Round which the lily makes its bed;
   Two dimples sweet good nature speak,
     And auburn ringlets deck her head.
   Her heaving breasts pant keen desire,
     Their blushing summits own the flame;
   Her eyes seem wishing _something nigher_,
     Her hand conducts it to the same.

   Miss B--nd is a very genteel agreeable
little girl, and is distinguished more by
the elegancy of her dress, than the beauty
of her person, which might perhaps have
been ranked in the list of tolerable's, had
not the small-pox been quite so unkind;
she is, nevertheless, a desirable _well tem-
                                       pered

               ( 50 )

pered piece_, and one that does not degrade
herself by her company or her actions;
she comes into our corps, in confequence
of her good keeper's leaving England,
and enlists a volunteer, in all the spright-
liness and vivacity of nineteen, with
beautiful auburn hair, and a pair of
pretty languishing blue peepers, that
seem at every glance to tell you how
nature stands affected below; nor will
those swimming luminaries deceive you;
_it_ is ever ready to receive the _well formed
tumid guest_, and as the _external crura_ en-
twine and press _home_ the _vigorous tool_, the
_internal crura_ embrace it, and presses out
the last _precious drops_ of the _vital fluid_,
which her hand, by stealth, conveyed to
the _treasure bags_ of nature, by tender
_squeezings_ seem to increase the undiscrib-
able rapture, at the _dye away moment_; in
short, during her performance of _venereal
rites_, she is all the heart of the most in-
flamed sensualist can wish, or any man
that has two spare guineas in his pocket,
can desire.


                                    Miss

Miss Gr--n, No. 32, _Little Russel-Street_.

   Strait a new heat return'd with his embrace,
Warmth to my blood and colour to my face;
Till at the length, with mutual kisses fir'd,)
To the last bliss we eagerly aspir'd,        ]
And both alike attain'd, what both alike     )
      desir'd.

When beauty beats up for recruits, he
must be an errant coward indeed, who re-
fuses to enlist under its banner; and
when good humour, complaisance, and
engaging behaviour are the rewards of
service, it is shameful to desert. This
lady's charms attract most who behold
them; though of a low stature, and
rather under the middle size, she is ele-
gantly formed; her black eyes, contrasted
with her white teeth, are highly pleasing,
and the goodness of her temper rivets the
chains which her agreeable form first put
one. One guinea, is then, too poor a re-
compence for such merit; and it is to be
deplored, that a girl, who should only
exchange love for love, should be obliged
to take payment for what is ever beyond
price: in bed, she is by far the better
                                 piece,

               ( 52 )

piece, and is up to every manoeuvre
necessary to restore life, and every
luscious _move_ to destroy; hands, tongue,
lips, legs, and every part of the busy
frame is engaged at once in the pleasing
task, and all to provoke and bring the
_soul breathing conflict_ to the _last extatic
gush_.

   ---------------------- O my soul,
   Whither, whither art thou flying,
   Lost in sweet tumultuous dying?
   You tremble love, and so do I!
   Ah! stay, and we'll together dye;
   My soul shall take her flight with thine
   Life dissolving in delight,
   Heaving breasts and swimming sight,
   Faultering speech and gasping breath,
   Symptoms of delicious death;
   My soul is ready for the flight.

   This lady appeared some years ago, to
our readers, under the name of Ogl--,
but as we have frequently seen, that a
girl, though young, may yet be very
                      disagreeable,

               ( 53 )

disagreeable, so we may conclude, from
Mrs. D--d, that a woman in years may
be perfectly alluring; she is, indeed,
turned of forty, rather fat and
short, yet she looks well, dresses neat,
and can divide as smartly covered, and
as neat a leg and foot as ever beat time
to _the silent flute_; her temper and be-
haviour are good, and if you are not soon
disposed for the attack, she will shew you
such a set of pictures, that very seldom
fails to alarm the sleeping _member_. Then
may you behold the _lovely fount_ of de-
light, reared on two pillars of monu-
menatal alabaster; the symmetry of its
parts, its _borders_ enriched with _wavering
tendrils_, its _ruby portals_, and the _tufted
grove_, that crowns the summit of the
mount, all join to invite the guest to
enter. The cordial reception he meets
therein, with the tide of _flowing bliss_,
more delicious than the boasted nectar
of the gods, engulph the raptured soul,
and set the lovely owner of the premisses,
above nine tenths of the green gew-
gaws that flutter about the town. If
discipline forms the soldier in the wars
of Mars, experience finishes the female
combatant in the skirmishes of Venus.
That experience this lady has,and is
                                per-

               ( 54 )

perfectly skilled in every delightful
manoeuvre, knowing how to keep time,
when to advance and retreat, to face to
the right or left, and when to _shower_
down a whole _volley_ of _love_; so that those
who are vanquished by her glory in their
defeat, pant only for returning vigour to
renew the combat; she is perfectly
mistress in the art of restoring life, and
performs the tender friction with a hand
soft as turtles down. Keeps the house,
and after giving you a whole night's en-
tertainment, is perfectly satisfyed, and
will give you a comfortable cup of tea in
the morning, for one pound one.

Miss Bl--ke, No. 74, _Castle Street,
            Oxford Road_.

   The soft desiring girl expects thy coming;
   Busy in thought, and hasty for the hour,
   She turns and sighs, and wishes, counts the
      clock,
   And every minute drags a heavy pace,
   Till thou appear, the champion of the bed,
   Arm'd at all points, and eager for the charge
   That calls thee to the combat of thy love.

   This lady's graceful figure, beautiful
face, dark hair, and ivory teeth, must
                                surely

               ( 55 )

surely win the heart of every one, who
is fortunate enough to get into her com-
pany,  and make you pant for the en-
joyment of the more essential bliss; for
the performance of which, who indeed,
is better qualified? who is of a sweeter
temper? who can better twine in the en-
chanting folds of love? who can fill the
night with stranger raptures? few, if
any. Inslead of expecting two guineas
for the performance, we may rather
wonder at her moderation in not ex-
pecting more: and though she is per-
fectly charming when drest, yet we are
informed that her naked beauties are still
more enchanting; her lovely demi
globes of delight, with their ruby buds,
ravish the wondering eye. Descend still
lower to the _regions of happiness_, the _true
country of pleasure_, and there appear the
_flaxen tendrils_ wantonly playing over the
_mother of all saints_, whilst the _pouting
protuberances_ leave it doubtful which _lips_
better deserve the burning kiss; the ex-
tatic embrace both act in concert, and
charm with delightful unison; whilst
those _above_ murmur the transports of the
soul, those which are placed _below_, per-
form the delicious suction, which cannot
be resisted till every atom of the genial
                                    juice

               ( 56 )

juice is drawn through its most natural
vent--that the man blest with enjoy-
ment, may cry out with Lee in his
_Caesar Borgia_,


   ---------O thou great chemise, nature,
   Who draw'st one spirit so divinely perfect,
   Thou mak'st a dreg of all the world beside.

   Ireland lays claim to the honour of
giving birth to this charming girl, who
has not sported her figure in public
life more than ten months; indeed her
particular friend, the Captain, whose
name she has taken the liberty of
assuming, thinks her rather more honest
than we believe her to be; she is now
in her eighteenth year, dances well,
and is fond of frequenting public hops,
where, if her partner pleases her, for
two guineas she has no objection to
take him home, and return the com-
pliment, that is, provided the Captain,
is from town.

Miss M--nt--n, No. 55, _Berwick-Street,
               Soho_.

   Toil all the night, and at the approach of
        morn,
   When tir'd nature calls aloud for rest,
   The wanton fair, a stranger to fatigue,
   With eager fondness will renew the sport;
   Entwine the busy limbs to force the joy,
   Whilst through the parting lips, the playful
       tongue,
   The vital fire thro' every nerve propels,
   And drown the senses in love's potent stream.

   Would the amorous _devotee_ wish us
to say more, perhaps he may require
personal charms, even then he will not
be disappointed; she is of the brunette
cast, with fine languishing eyes, fine
even teeth, plump, well formed, pant-
ing bubbies, and as she has now only
entered into her nineteenth year, can-
not possibly have lost the transports
of _mutuality_; at present she trades the
independant lass, having no particular
                               friend

               ( 58 )

friend to humour or offend; she takes
her noon and evening excursions re-
gularly, and enjoys, with unfeigned rap-
ture, every man of pleasure that _en-
ters_ properly equipped for the sport;
and her love of variety, and her at-
tachment to the sport, is so very
prevalent, that, provided the gentle-
man's pocket is sufficiently armed,
there is not the least reason to fear she
then will meet him _midway_, with true
rapture, will _grasp_ the _pointed weapon_ with
genuine female fortitude, and urge him
_home_ with singular delight, _lesson_ his
_pride_ with becoming dignity, and ask
repeated pleasures.------It is now only
eight months we have been able to
call her _our own_, and as she seems sa-
tisfied with one guinea, would recom-
mend her as a _deserving_ peice.

   "Let _Nature_ empty her whole quiver in me,
   "I have a _part_, which, like an ample shield,
    Can _take in all_, and yet leave room for more.

   This lady assumed the name, she at
present goes by, from motives of con-
                             cealment

               ( 59 )

cealment in her _sportive_ profession, in
which the drives a good trade, and is
very much lik'd by the _beaux esprits_ of
the age for her _spunk_, being remarkably
full of Cyprian Spirit, many degrees
above any proof it has ever been put to;
so that for the power of her parts, and
active ability, she could match Turk
Gregory; and when she had him in her
tenacious arms, he might perform the
amorous feat within the _magic circle_ of her
charms, till even strength, like his, was
_spent_, and nature quite exhausted of all
her balmy store, whilst she, untired, and
springing from the bed, would ask a fresh
attack, and still give pleasure in the warm
embrace; she is of a dark complexion,
with a wide mouth, and extraordinary
well formed for a winter's companion.
She has no pretensions to beauty, but
founds her claims to public favour on in-
ternal merit, and her _capacity_ and skill in
the rites of Venus, appealing rather to
the sense of touch, than that of sight; she
is in general to be met with at a favourite
hop, at the west end of the town, and if
Mr. B--rd should not be there, you may
gain the liberty of attending her home,
and the will thank you for half a guinea.

           Street East_.

   Behold those eyes that swim in humid fires,
   And trace her wanton thoughts and young
      desires;
   Taste those sweet lips, with balmy Nectar
       fraught,
   And all the rich luxuriancy of thought:
   Press her soft bosom--seat of swelling joy,
   Whose charms invite the rosy pinion'd boy;
   Who, fluttering here, may point the unerring
      dart,
   Flash in each eye, and revel in each heart,
   Till bolder grown, your hand insatiate rove,
   O'er her delightful _mount_ and _sportive grove_;
   Then all her limbs unbound, her girdle loose,
   There's nothing you can ask her, she'll refuse.

   The above lines, from one of the
warmest and most elegant poets fancy
ever favoured, might be very justly ap-
plied to this charming girl. Rich with
the glow of youth, and the charms of a
person, in which nature has been lavishly
bountiful, she possesses a mind rarely,
very rarely met with in the frail
daughters of pleasure; generous, free-
                              hearted,

               ( 61 )

hearted, noble, feeling, and disinterested,
might appear to be too high sounding
epithets for a woman of this dercription.
But however strange, it is not less strange
than true; for she possesses qualities,
which the want of, might make many a
titled dame, poessessed of that single virtue,
(or at least appearing to possess it) that
she has unfortunately lost,--blush, for
they may all with the strictest truth be
applied to her. Here then, may the
man come, (nay, we advise him to) who
wishes in the morning, succeedimg a de-
licious night, to find his person and his
purse safe, and his health uninjured;
here may he come, and taste every joy
the most luscious desire can wish; here
may his very sense be fed, nor know
satiety, for joined to a beautiful face, an
elegant form, and a graceful manner,
you win find the agreeable companion,
the good humoured girl, and the most
enchanting bedfellow; young, and not
more than three months _on_ the town, or
_in_ the town, fine hazel love-swimming
eyes, and dark brown hair, which left to
twine in nature's wanton folds, plays
loosely over a neck white as snow un-
sunned, and sweetly shades the most en-
chanting _love hillocks_ nature ever planted
                                       _below_

               ( 62 )

_below_, a jetty _black_ surrounds the _pouting
mansion_, rais'd on a pair of pillars that
might _shame_ the _whitest_, or mark the
smoothest alabaster, that twine in the
amorous encounter, and seem to partake
of that pleasure in the dye-away moment,
that we cannot pretend to set any value
upon.

She is the daughter of a banker in the

not her itch for _variety_, and the brandy

at the full age of twenty-six, with fine

sparkling blue eyes, genteel tall figure,
her breasts rather full but not less firm,
very fair, and contrasted beautifully by
the blue branching veins which surround
every part; apparently light brown hair,
but so covered with powder that the colour
is doubtful; of a sprightly and amorous
disposition, and a very warm temper,
especially when _tempered_ by her favorite
liquor, of which she loves to take large
and copious libations, ever desirous of
seeing the bottom. Her price is moderate,
the smallest piece being as much as she
in general expects.

Her price is from two guineas upwards,
to any sum the gentleman she obliges

age of twenty cannot be too much. Had
she less partiality for a certain hair dresser,
we think she would be more pleasing to
the generality of her visitors.

   Here roses red, and lilys fair;

   Oh for a touch of the pencil of anima-

lively productions in our exhibition; she
is genteel and well made, with a beautiful
face, the tints in which are done by
nature alone, fine light hair, and a pretty

smart, and her dress at once neat and

powers of this lady; she is acquainted at
                                     once

               ( 69 )

once with the whole rationale of love, as
well as with the entire practice of it; and
whether we talk of those mysteries which
are only known by the adepts, or those
more clumsily applied operations of the
lower orders of the sisterhood, she is up
to every thing in love's tactics. Her
dialect does not tell us she is a native of
Scotland, tho' her father, who is an
half pay officer, yet resides there; at
this period when the powers of love or
lust are at their full bloom, necessity and
inclination together, prompted her to
become a dancer on our cyprian stage,
and is very desirous of pleasing every
man that makes her his partner, and is
so very careful of her health, that before
she receives her _guinea_, she must examine
every _one_ of her partner's _legs_.

   When will the dear man come, that I may
    hold him
   Fast as my love can make him, hug him close
   As my fond soul can wish; give all my breath
   In sighs and kisses, tell I swoon with rapture.

   All this she seems to say to each
admirer; it cannot be true to all. But
                                    no

               ( 70 )

no matter. Vanity whispers to each,
_this is for thee alone_, and the self-deceived
dolt believes it. Miss S--tt--n, indeed,
can give pleasure; her agreeable per-
son, animated eyes, and lively manner,
promise pleasing enjoyment, and in that
she does not deceive; she artfully prolongs
the pleasure to its utmost limits, and even
then repines it is so short. She is of a
comfortable size, genteelly form'd, with a
pretty round face, a little pimpled, very
pretty orient teeth, and now just entered
her twenty-second year; her lodgings are
neat and elegant, for the use of which,
and a little _black apartment_, she always
carries about her; she expects, at least 3
guineas; if not at home, in the evening,
is generally to be met with in the green
boxes.

Miss C--p--r, at a China shop, _Russell
               Court_.

         Let me press therein my arms,
   Tune of my heart, and charmer of my eyes,
   Nay, thou shall hear the extacy from me,
   I'll make thee smile with my extravagant passion.

This lady is neither handsome, well
dress'd, well lodg'd, nor well bred; yet
                                     she

               ( 71 )

she will give more delight than most of
the finical dames, who think they do
their gallants a favour to admit their em-
braces at a high price. This humble girl
is thankful for a crown, and will testify
her gratitude in whatever way you chuse,
she is willing to appear in the dress of
_pure nature_, as her skin is without spot
or blemish, her breasts small and plump,
and her limbs well turned and well pro-
portioned. It is her joy to give joy, and
she omits no means of procuring it;
though her compliance is ample, she is
so reserved in her demand that she takes
what is given, and does not, like too
many of her sisterhood, seize the minute
just preceding the moment of extacy to
demand more, and either proceed or
draw back as her demands are gratify'd or
not. In short she is worthy of some de-
gree of elevation, to enable her to walk
a more gainful round than Catherine-
street, or the Strand. She has lately been
to visit her parents in Derbyshire, and is
now returned a tolerable fresh piece
again.

                                 Mrs.

               ( 72 )

Mrs. H--w--rd, No. 14, _Moor's-place,
	Lambeth_.

   Her brows are arch'd, and rather full and thin,
   To shade the dazzling light that dwells therein.

   Although Mrs. H--w--rd cannot be
more than twenty-six, she has been a true
sportswoman, at the cyprian games, for
at least twelve years, and has within these
late ones contracted such an habit of in-
timacy with the gin bottle, that unless a
person is particularly partial to it, it is al-
most intolerable, to approach her. At
Brighton, this last season, she was the fa-
vourite girl at Mrs.John--n's, and had she
not, through a foolish fondness, gave the
preference to her dear Mr. Sn--m,
it is in general believed Mr. W----, the
capital Brewer, would have taken her
under his own protection; she is rather too
short, and too fat, fine dark hair; and
eyes and eye-brows that answer very well
to her motto; the _grove_ below is _well
thatched_, and ample enough in size to _take
in_ any guest; but still she has learnt the
knack of _contracting_ it, and a small made
gentleman may feel the tender friction.
When she elopes from her dear fellow,
she is to be met with at Mrs. J--ns--n's,
in German-street, and does not turn
away any money offered her.

               ( 73 )

Mrs. H--ll--ngb--rg, No. 4, _Castle-
            Street, East_.

   In hell and earth, and seas and heaven above,
   Love conquers all, and we must yield to force.

   This lady, tho' an adept in the art, so
nobly erases true impudence, with false
modesty, that her lover would be almost
lead to think his chosen fair, at first sight,
an immaculate Virgin. The _supreme gush_,
the enraptured moment she so mutually
interchanges, or at least seems so to do,
that she might well be stil'd the paragon
of her sex; and so perfectly well convin-
ced of her own proficiency in the art,
(altho in spite, of those killing lumi-
naries, embellished by a tolerable good
skin, she has too large a mouth ever to
be stil'd a beauty) she never will see her
man a second time, unless Plutus has suf-
ficiently shewn his power first. Our
charmer was taken from her parents, and
taught the use of the _tree of life_ at a very
early period; but never had the good for-
tune on her side to be much exalted: in-
deed, when we consider the more early
part of her life was spent, and the whole
of her education was received in a sea port
town, we cannot be much surprised.

                                  Miss

               ( 74 )

Miss R--b--ns--n, No 14, Lisle Street,
          Leciester Fields.

   Thou can'st not see one wrinkle in my brow,
   My eyes tho' dark, are bright and quick in
       turning,
   My beauty as the spring does yearly grow,
   My flesh is soft and plump; my marrow
      burning.

   It is not surprising, the notice which
a lady, who as long _erected_ her standard
in the _field_ of _pleasure_, attracts from the
veterans in the same field. This is the case
of our heroine, now about twenty-eight
years of age, tall, rather lusty, and a
figure that speaks true symmetry; hand-
some, a slight tinge of the brunette in
her complexion, with very fine dark hair,
fine hazel eyes, very dark, and finely
arch'd eye brows; indeed, she has been
a very fine woman, and is far from being
in her wane of beauty; her hair, indeed,
is remarkably fine, and such a length, as
to be able to be interwoven with her _once
maidenhead thicket_, now grown to a _fine
bushy arbour_ surrounding the _blissful cell_ of
the blind sovereign of wanton sports,
where he reigns predominant over every
                                 sense,

               ( 75 )

sense, and subjects all the rest to that of
feeling; here he keeps his court and holds
his revels; come then ye followers of Co-
mus, plunge your burning _plough shares_
within the betwiching circle, and slake
the hot breathing of untamed desire; here
dance the round of joy till sense grows
giddy in the maze, and taste the delicious
transports of maddening delight, till _pan-
ting nature striking the alarm_, proclaims a
_dying pause_ to her own music, and _pours_
forth the _flood_ of mingled rapture; she has
good breasts, and her limbs are finely
turn'd and proportioned; she is of a very
good disposition, and a most agreeable
companion, and is at present in keep-
ing by a Mr. M--lls; but being fond of
the _glow_ of youth, and the manly embrace
of full vigour, she indulges variety, and
is various in her expectation for so doing.

   What pity 'tis so fine a face and form
   Should suffer pride, the cankerworms of joy,
   That beauty to deform.

   If a warm son of Bacchus, flush'd with
the fullness of desire impetuous, Would wish

               ( 76 )

to melt a haughty temper down to the
standard of all complying love, let him
repair to this imperious golden hair'd
beauty, for however proud, she will stoop
to conquer any bold _invader_; and you
may lay her on her back by closing with
her in the athletic exercise of wrestling,
as she is very fond of Cupid's _hug_, and the
amorous _lock_, and will wait your _further_
attack with becoming spirit, and engage
your _champion_ of her _ring_, with a grasp,
till he is reduced to _bend_ beneath the
powerful squeeze, and _yield_ all the _metal_
he has about him to his circling antago-
nist, who, so far from behaving ungene-
rous, will give out in exchange as much,
or more rich treasure of another coin, in
token of mutual amity; in short she is as
smart a little girl as you will in general
see of her complexion and size, and bor-
rows her name from a gentleman who is
a very good friend, but does not expect
her to confine the whole of her favours to
him alone; but allows her to pick up her
odd guineas as she pleases.

                                   Mrs.

Mrs L--w--s, _Upper Charlotte Street,
          Rathbone Place_.

   Sure nature cast one in her softest mould,
   All mild and gentle, never made to scold.

   West Indies gave birth to this daugh-
ter of Momus by Venus; the warmth of
the clime brought the charming girl's feel-
ing to maturity at an early period, and
a gentleman, whose name she assumes,
first _trod_ down _Hymen's_ fence, and made
her a perfect woman; but the natural
warmth of her constitution soon compell-
ed her to seek variety in our great mart;
she therefore left her good friend, and
now presents the world with a sweet
chearful disposition, fine dark hair, and
eyes of the same friendly hue; fine teeth,
is short and plump, and we have not had
her above eighteen months; she expects
three guineas for a whole night, but if you
make a short visit, one pound one shilling
is the least.

                                    Betsy

               ( 78 )

B--t--sy, at Mrs. Kelly's, _Duke Street,
              St. James's_.

   --Endless joys are in that heaven of love,
   A thousand Cupids dance upon her smiles;
   Young bathing graces wanton in her eyes,
   Melt in her looks, and pant upon her breasts;
   Each word is gentle as a western breeze
   That fans the infant bosom of the spring,
   And every sigh more fragrant than the morn.

   This beautiful girl, that goes by no
other name than Betsy, was formely a
retailer of apples, &c. She has lately,
with three other ladies, sported her figure
at Bath, and was there the reigning toast
amongst the first bucks of the place; she
is delicately and genteely form'd, about
the middle size, very young and spright-
ly, and modest in her conversation, ex-
cept when proper occasions demand wan-
ton freedom; her hair and eyes are black,
and her teeth remarkably white, through
which she plays the velvet tip with un-
common grace and ardour; we cannot
pretend to say who cropt the virgin bud
from the beautiful tree, but it could be
long before she put herself under the care
and direction of Mrs. K----, and under
such a tutoress we have no doubt but she
                                    will

               ( 79 )

will be soon such a complete mistress of
her business, that join'd with her personal
accomplishments, will bring her into the
molt elevated life. Many of the post
steeds of Venus have been so often hack'd,
that they are broken winded, halt in
their paces, and are well nigh founder'd,
so as to be scarce fit for any thing but
_brood mares_, if they are not too old.
There will therefore be full room for
Betsy to succeed some of the most eminent,
as she is well worthy of the embraces of
the first men in the kingdom. Some
who have possess'd her speak with rap-
tures of the joy she bestows, they say the
beauties she displays when drest, great
as they are, are trivial to those which cus-
tom keeps concealed; they say the mossy
grot of Venus is perfectly enchanting;
her thighs are two alabaster pillars,
which with the ebon tendril that play in
wanton ringlets round the grot, and
the crimson lining of the elastic portals,
form together that perfect _clare obscure_, so
much admir'd in painting, and which al-
ways produce a most pleasing effect; that
her lovely snowy breasts are quickly be-
spread with purple meandring veins, and
that her murmurs, her broken sighs of
                                 joy,

               ( 80 )

joy, and half spoken words of delight in
the rapturous minute, justify fully, the
exclamation of the poet.

    Oh! how sweet to see her eyes
    Rolling in their humid fires,
   Where the nymph extended lies
    Full of love and soft desires;
   Conscious red her cheeks o'er spreading,
    And her heaving bosom rising,
   Milky paths to raptures leading,
    Murmuring sighs her joys disguising.

   Where did my soul in the dear transport go?
   Did it with willing haste to her depart?
   It did, I'm sure, and fluttered around her
       heart;
   It heav'd, it trembled, and it panted there,
   But all its weak efforts to stay were vain,
   A kiss restored the fugitive again;
   My soul re-enterd, we repeated o'er
   A thousand joys unknown to both before.

   In the bloom of sixteen, tall and ele-
gantly genteel, with fine black expressive
eyes, and remarkable fine hair, which
                                 flows

               ( 81 )

flows in graceful ringlets down her back,
and with an envious shade sweetly pro-
tects two of the most enchanting snowy
hillocks nature ever formed. Miss
P---- may well please, may well
attract the eye. She does please, she
does attract, and upon every account
well merits the attention of the man of
true taste. Untutored by art, and taught
only by powerful nature, she charms in
enjoyment; and as she has not, from
over frequency, been rendered callous
to the joys of love, she repays every
rapture with interest, and meets the
blissful moment with a tepid flood of
delight. At present she is in good
keeping by a citizen, not many miles
from Fleet Market, and having been
only three months under his care, has
not yet been sufficiently broke for the
sport, hope therefore that some of our
good friends will, by properly supplying
the citizen's place at those hours his
employment obliges him to be absent,
_instill_ into _her_ such _principles_ that will
at least raise her spunk to _proof_; but'
altho' young, she can well dispense with
a little more pocket money than her
keeper allows, and always expects twice
the number of pieces that her paramour
gives proofs of his manhood.

   ---------Born with every grace,
   Ev'n envy must applaud so fair a face;
   Such is her form as painters when they show
   Their utmost art, on naked limbs bestow.

   This pretty little smart girl, this true
lover of the sport, is at present in keeping
by a member of P--------t, not far
from St. James's; but not being suffi-
ciently _membered_ for her _lower house_, she
appropriates the greatest part of the
member's hard coin to support and keep
in good humour two favourites of her
own. The one a tender sprig of the
law, the other a jolly hearty looking
butcher; but still in spite of these three,
she has her _best apartment_ ready for any
one that is master of five guineas, and
will make her mistress of the same;
it is neatly ornamented with chestnut
coloured fringe, is snug and warm, and
when not _too warm_ (which we are told is
sometimes the case) very comfortable;
she is now only seventeen, her dark eyes
have much lustre and more meaning:
                                her

               ( 83 )

her limbs, tho' small, are well shaped,
covered with a skin fair as the swan's
neck, and soft as its down, they are
perfectly pliable, and form a thousand
true lovers knots, first to facilitate the
entrance into her _apartment_, and then
to keep the enraptured lodger there as
long as possible. Indeed, she never lets
one depart till he has paid his _rent_; but
to shew she is not avaricious, she
generally returns as much as she receives,
in the like _metal_, tho' not in the same
coin.

               ( 84 )

female votaries, shot poor Sally deep in
the heart; going to partake of an
innocent amusement, vulgarly called
_black hops_, where twelve pence will gain
admission, she beheld, oh dire misfortune!
a lovely African, blooming with all the
hue of the warm country that gave him
birth, and fell at that instant a sacrifice
to the charms of the well made sooty
frizeur; for some time she ranked him
amongst her own train, and charitably
exerted herself for his	support, but
growing at length satiated with his dear
company, and almost ruined in the bar-
gain, she dismissed the gloomy object of
her late desires, and parted mutual
friends; since which time she has graced
the purlieus of Covent-Garden with her
presence, and is perfectly well known
under the Piazza. She is about twenty-
three, light hair and eyes, a good skin,
and size compleatly adapted for this
season, and which seems to please the
greatest part of her friends and customers,
who think two arms full of joy _twice_ as
good as one; she is remarkably good-
natured and affable to those who favour
her with a visit, and will take almost
any sum rather than turn her visitor
                            away;

               ( 85 )

away; but if you absolutely bilk her,
beware of the consequence; for she is
so well convinced that she does not
merit such treatment, that she will, if
possible, revenge the injury; but we hope
none of our friends will ever pay her a
whole noctunal visit without a small
piece of gold in his pocket, as she is an
able pasture maker, is up to every
movement in the art of giving pleasure,
and will oblige them in any way.

   Here haste ye gay, take pleasure on the wing,

   This agreeable girl has a pretty face
suffused with a good complexion, dark
penetrating eyes, hair of the same hue,
which waves in glossy ringlets o'er her
shoulders, a set of good teeth, and a
stature of the exact medium between a
giant and a pigmy; she has not been
more than eight months in this grand
mart of universal commerce, and now
stands out for a settlement from some of
her _warm_ admirers, which (being at the
                                    rich

her

Some ladies prefer the profit, others
the pleasure; some may divide it equally
in their choice, and perhaps their may
be, among Venus's tribe, the lady found
almost indifferent to either; this lady
however we may venture to affirm is not
of the last stamp; she is a fine inviting
looking girl, with very lively Cupidinous
eyes and a good complexion, and scarcely
ever to be found but in a good humour;

and her paramour, provided he can prove
himself the good bed fellow, has nothing
to fear in this lady's company, as money
with her is not the entire object, it is the
enjoyment that constitutes her happiness,
and in that part she is a truly lovely ac-
tress; her twining limbs never forget their
office; her busy lips is mistress of the ge-
nuine burning kiss, and the intermediate
parts move in every direction that can
possibly enhance the coming joy, which
she will powerfully urge a repetition of,
as long as dame nature can possibly af-
ford it. She is at prefent in keeping by
a French count, who though very jea-
lous, often suffers her to sport it in his
chariot, during which time her tell-
tale black eyes, is busy in hunting for ad-
mirers, and can tip the wink and con-
duct him, if approved, to a safe harbour;
and altho' not so very fond of money,
she does not expect to have less than five
guineas offered her.

without being pretty, she is well made,
without being strictly genteel; and a friend
to mirth and good humour, without vul-
garity. She carries on a snug good trade,
without going much abroad, and is in bed
a very amorous companion. If she does go
abroad it is generally to some of the pub-
iic hops, where she contrives to select out
her partner for the night, and will con-
vince him (although she dances well a-
midst twenty couple) that she _cuts_ a much
better _figure_ with only _one_, and being now
only twenty years of age,with good nature,
affability, and love depicted in all her
actions, no one that has three guineas in
his pocket, ought to be against parting
with two thirds to oblige her.

   It is an undoubted fact she, must
please, she must charm the heart, and
win the foul to exquisite delight; how
can it be otherwise! behold her eyes,
drinking their living moisture in cups of
the purest hazel, and holding converse
with the heart, in such a language, the
least meeting glance must immediately un-
derstand; behold her hair, glossy as the
pearly drops that gild the flow'ry field
when Phoebus first his eastern rays ex-
tends, and soft as turtles down; which,
when suffered to sport in nature's wanton
folds, hold all the graces in their sportive
curls; view next her teeth, as white as
the polish'd elephants, and beautiful as
white;

   Cheeks from whence the roses seek their
        bloom,
   And lips from whence the zephyrs steal perfume

but all these charms united, fall very
short of her mental qualifications: her
                                  lively

               ( 90 )

lively wit charms the heart, and makes
her the desirable companion; her beha-
viour, Which in company never deviates
from the strict line of modesty, gains her
the truest merit: her apartments are very
genteel, and her dress corresponds with
her person. Her professional abilities
are not less to be priz'd than her other na-
tural gifts; her natural structure in those
parts is so well adapted, that it must
please; and every additional improvement
to enhance the coming pleasure our deli-
cate charmer is well acquainted with;
being now only nineteen she cannot, in
the least, have lost the keen edge of amo-
rous transport; neither are the essential
parts at all deprived of their magical
power; the liquid eye streams with the
maddening fire of youth, with all the
desires of unsatiated love; the panting
heave, accompanying the quick inter-
rupted sigh, speaks desire in its fullest
tone; and so mutually does she inter-
change the liquid store at the die-away
convulsive moment, that all her soul seems
centred in the blissful spot. She is tall,
and elegantly form'd in every limb;
Mr. Arch--r, the musician, is at present
her favourite man; him she will oblige
at any time, from every one else she
expects three guineas.

Miss D--v--nsh--re, No. 9, _Queen
     Anne Street East_

   Fool! not to know that love endures no tie,
   And Jove but laughs at lovers perjury.

   This lady is a native of Devonshire,
and has only been _one_ of _us_ four months;
she is of a fine fair complexion, love
tinctured cerulean eyes, fine teeth, and
genteel good figure; a charming partner
in a dance, a eery good companion by
the fire side, and dearly loves an agreeable
friend and a chearful glass; many a
_man_ of war hath been her willing prisoner,
and paid a proper ransom; her port is
said to be well guarded by a light brown
_chevaux-de-freize_, and parted from _Bum-
bay_ by a very small pleasant isthmus.
The entry is rather straight; but when
once in, their is very good _riding_; and
when they have paid _port customs_, they
are suffered to slip out very easily, though
generally followed by a salute from _Crown-
point_, which hastens their departure by
causing the floodgates to open com-
modiously. She is so brave, that she is
ever ready for an engagement; cares not
how soon she comes to _close quarters_, and
loves to fight _yard arm_ and _yard arm_, and
                                           be

               ( 92 )

be briskly _boarded_; she is best pleased
when her opponent is _well armed_, and
Would despise any warrior, who had not
_two_ stout _balls_ to block up her _covered
way_, and did not carry metal enough to
leave _two pounds_ behind him.

   The blooming looks of spring, and lovely red
   As opening roses, on her cheeks are spread;
   Her eyes that sparkle like the stars above,
   Appear the armory and throne of love,
   Whilst thousands of alluring graces Wait,
   And mingling charms form love's triumphant
       state.

   This lady is tolerably handsome, with
a fine dark durable complexion, fine
hazel eyes and good teeth, which, by a
perpetual smile, or rather grin, she has
acquired a very convenient knack of
shewing; she is tall, and the goodness of
her temper and disposition render her a
very agreeable companion and makes
her at present much sought after. We
hear the first toast she drinks every day is
                                         to

               ( 93 )

to the health of Mr. N----, a gentle-
man of the law, whose name she has
taken the liberty of substituting for her
own; she has not yet been a year on the
town, yet has done great execution
amongst the tender hearts of the men of
the _ton_, many of which she has kindled
into a flame. She is as fond of variety
as any _baronet_'s lady, and will display her
naked beauties to any curious observer,
without giving them the trouble to
mount On any other _man's shoulder_ to take
a peep at them.	She is very tall, and
the _pit_ in her black heath is said to have
a considerable profundity, and has baff-
led the art of many a gauger to take it
precisely with the best dipping rules; yet
though the attempt has been unsuccessful,
it hath not been undelightful, for the
passage being straight much pleasure has
been derived by the _gauger_, during which
pleasing pastime

   A gentle warmth invades her glowing breast,
   And while she fondly gazes on thy face,
   Ev'n thought is lost in exquisite delights;

and she is so generous, that as she knows
the hours of love are but short, she always
fills up every moment of them with rap-
ture. She well knows how to wind the
                               _clock_

               ( 94 )

_clock_ of nature up to the _highest pitch_, and
make the _human pendulum_ vibrate to ex-
tasy; nay, she can so well fill up what
the Poet calls the _dull pause of joy_, that its
duration is scarce perceiv'd, and she beats
an almost instantaneous alarm to blissful
repetition.

   ---------------Sacrifice to her
   The precious hours, nor grudge with such a
       mate
   The summer's day to toy or winter's night.
   Now clasp with dying fondness in your arms
   Her yielding waist, now on her swelling breast
   Recline your cheek, with eager kises press
   Her balmy lips, and drinking from her eyes
   Resistless love, the tender flame confess
   Ineffable, but by the murmuring voice
   Of genuine joy.

This lively girl is a native of Somerset-
shire, and being thought by her good
parents the rose of the garden, received
an education perhaps beyond what their
circumstances would then admit of, and
                                  pride

               ( 95 )

pride with innocence danced hand in
hand. From a great desire of becoming
well acquainted with the world she was
apprenticed to a millener of the same
place,

   Whose parent _hand_ the first _ideas_ form'd.

Scarce fifteen ripening autumns had
arrived, e'er she felt the divine influence
nature began to inspire her with; the
little fluid nipples till now unnoticed and
almost unseen, began to strut in all the
elegance of infant prime; the heart
began to feel their sovereign power, and
modest nature painted the budding blush
in the centre; nature's sink began no
longer to be thought as such, since now
another fluid passed the narrow bounds,
and instilled, by power instinctive, fresh
feeling into the whole channel, and
every thought and every action seemed
founded on those feelings. It is now
about ten months since she arrived, and
enlisted in the Cyprian choir; she possesses
a delicate fair complexion, with lively
blue eyes, a pretty mouth, and is well
embellished with two rows of polished
ivory; we cannot pretend to stile her a
beauty, but her lively and chearful
disposition, and her accomplishments
                               under

               ( 96 )

under _cover_ in great measure compensate
for the deficiency in her person, and make
one pound one a trifle for a whole night's
possession.

     To arms, to arms, the Cyprian Queen
     Here braves the god of War,
   And tho' on back, not backward seen
     To take his wond'rous spear,
   And melt it in her _clasping fold_,
     The fold of rapturous burning bliss,
  'Till quite o'erspent in nature's _mould_,
     Then darts fresh vigor with a kiss.

   If a first rate smart little buck would
wish for a mould to cast light infantry
men in, we would strongly recommend
him to Miss Ch--ld. She has a noble
martial disposition, and would sooner die
than be out rivalled; but independant of
that occurrence in her professional line,
her temper and disposition are good, and
her abilities between the sheets are not
easily equalled, excelled they cannot be;
                                      she

               ( 97 )

she possesses a pair of love speaking ceru-
lean eyes, and a bosom as rich with love's
choicest graces as luxuriant fancy can
paint, and filled with the most irresistable
firmness, whose panting redundancy soon
invite the amorous encounter, and calls
into action the till now _hidden friend_,
whose swelling pride and impertinence
will no longer suffer the curtain to remain
drawn. She may, perhaps, at first attempt
to chide, but bolt the door, and then all
chiding ceases; an experienced sofa
then lends its aid; her turning limbs en-
hance the _coming pleasure_, and sighing
kisses crown the _golden minute_; her fair
complexion charms the heart; her wic-
ked blue eyes enchant the soul; her well
made form tempts the touch; her lovely
voice charms the ear, and her glossy flaxen
hair is worth a guinea an hour to look at.

   Give me but thee, I'd make a heaven of earth,
   Each night should give to new born pleasure
       birth;
   The sun of _joy_ should point continual _noon_,
   And e'er an age of Noah, pass too soon.

   Thus sung prince ------, when he
first became bewitched with the dancing
                                    and

               ( 98 )

and singing of this sprightly piece, and
in consequence placed her in a genteel
lodgings, and for some time was, we be-
lieve, her sole enjoyer; but with all his be-
witching power, his show of arms, his
awful countenance; his martial figure,
and his warlike voice, could not confine
this amorous virago within the bands of
constancy, on which account it is in ge-
neral believed he left her, and now she
trades the independant woman. Her
beautiful complexion and her fine blue
eyes open such a field for love, that whilst
they retain their present lustre, she cannot
be without admirers. Her shape is ele-
gant, her stature tall and genteel, and
taking her every feature conjunctively, we
may say with the poet

   Here youth and beauty, dancing in her hand,
   Perform their mystic round of amorous joy.

She is now in her eighteenth year, and has
only been engaged in our business ten
months, and tho' she cannot be stiled an
epicure, she is most undoubtedly a glut-
ton, being particularly partial to that meal
where _four haunches_ are served up at once:
in her company they are sure to be dress'd
in taste, for she always chuses to _spit_ them
herself; and always has the greatest
                               share

               ( 99 )

share in _preparing_ the _sauce_; her price for
turning _cook_ is at least three guineas.

   Not less her blandishments than beauty move
   At once both giving and confessing love.

   This lady is about twenty-five, very
short, with dark hair and black eyes;
and was it not for her nose, which is quite
of the pug cast, we might stile her a com-
pleat black beauty; her _toute ensemble_
is very agreeable, and her blandishments
make her a desirable companion, as she
dresses in the height of the _ton_, sports an
elegant _rattler_, and at present figures a-
way in the first line. She has got a smat-
tering of the French and Italian (from
which last place she is lately come over,)
where we are told a prince of the blood
took particular notice of her, and learnt
her musick and dancing; it is about ten
months since we have been able to pre-
sent her to our readers, and if you sleep
a night with her, not less than half the
number of guineas will satisfy.

Mrs. W---d, No 3, _Lisle-street, Leicester
              Fields_.

   Oh! that deceit should steal such gentle shapes,
   And with a virtuous vizard hide deep vice.

   Mens palates are as various as their
faces, and like a good ordinary we would
offer up a dish for every palate. In the
time of the ancient Romans we are told
that the fat paps of the sow where held a
great dainty. For those that have a re-
lish for such a repast we recommend
Mrs. Wood, and can assure them, such
paps as she possesses are seldom to be met
with. She keeps the house, and is wife
to 'squire P--'s coachman, late of the sta-
bles, Bolton street; her front is well bra-
zen'd; her face is continually upon the
full grin, and as for talking bawdy, swea-
ring, or bare fac'd indecency, she could
vie with the ancient _Meselina_ of Rome;
she dispenses her favours for any sum to
one whose arms are sufficiently long to
embrace her, and may do now, but in
the dog days must be intolerable.

                               Miss

               ( 101 )

Miss J--nes, No. 75, _Newman-Street,
            Oxford-Street_.

   ------------Oh she's all softness,
   All melting mild, and calm as a rock'd infant;
   Nor can you wake her into cries, by heaven!
   She's the child of love, and she was born in
        smiles.

   Oh may the giddy rake, whose head
overpowered by the effects of the grape,
whose every thought, whose every idea
lies centered in the gratification of a
sensual appetite; whole impetuosity in-
discriminately rushes him on the first
object that presents herself, may he, at
this his most unguarded hour, rest in the
arms of this enchanting girl whose good
nature, care, and attention, might make
him reflect with pleasure  on the past
folly.	In her he'll meet with every
pleasing accomplishment the heart of
man could wish; her natural disposition
as yet remains unvitiated by the knowledge
of the world, or corrupted by the hand
of time. She is now in her eighteenth
year, with every amorous feeling nature
at this youthful period can furnish her
with; nor is she desirous of keeping
those feelings a secret. Look in those
                                   fine

               ( 1O2 )

fine black eyes, there read the perfect
language of her soul, for never was
_silent language_ so fully seen and felt; she
has a fine open handsome countenance,
tall of stature, and if her man is pleased
with a good song, he won't be didappoint-
ed by putting the request to our sweet
J--nes, whose good nature is such she
never refuses,

   Or should he wish to join the merry dance,
   Where the brisk couplets artfully advance.

Here likewise with our charmer as a
partner would he be equally delighted;
here she displays such a leg and foot, and
with so much activity, sprightliness, and
judgment, that none can see but admire,
admire but love; with all these qualifi-
cations, say you, she cannot be a bad
bedfellow; she has equal merits in bed,
and pleases there with equal certainty.
She is neither covetous, nor will she
sink below what her real merits deserve;
if after this, and our readers recollecting
she is but lately arrived from the lewd
mountains of Wales, he thinks two
guineas to much, he had better steer some
other course.

Miss Charlotte C--sd--l, No. 25,
 _Titchfield-Street, Oxford-Street_.

  'Till haply wandering in the fields of air,
   Some fiend had whisper'd C--sd--l, thou art
      fair.

We cannot help thinking but this was
the case with our charmer in question;
who, as we have heard, felt her first
desire for the sport from meer inclination;
she is tall and genteely framed, a pretty
innocent looking face, and a pair of
tempting breasts, that nineteen blooming
autumns have brought to full maturity;
a lively blue eye and flaxen hair; a
pretty reserved manner, (excepting when
exhilirated by the chearful glass) which
adds a particular grace to every feature,
and makes her doubly pleasing, fully
verifying Dr. Armstrong,

   The coyley yielded kiss charms most,
   And gives the most sincere delight;
   Cheapness offends.

Her temper is sweet, her manners affable,
and her dispofition good. She is remark-
ably fond of dancing, and on that
account frequents most of the public
hops; where she generally picks up her
spark, which is no longer a spark for her,
                                        if

               ( 104 )

if he is obliged to change the last guinea
to pay for coach hire.

   Give me a nymph with all her charms,
   A full grown nymph to fill my arms;
   And leave to them that cannot feel,
   The insipid things they call genteel.

Strange it is, but not less strange than
true, that Englishmen in general have a
great itch for variety; and according to
our promissary note in the preface, we
here present them with one of the finest,
fattest figures as fully finished for fun
and frolick as fertile fancy ever formed;
fraught with every melting charm that
can be found in the field of Venus, for-
tunate for the true lovers of fat, should
fate throw them into the possession of
such full grown. beauties. Can you
conceive the lightest tints of an Italian
sky? Such then her melting eye; can
you figure to your imagination the swel-
ling ripeness of two tempting cherries?
                                   such

               ( 105 )

such then her lips; though some might
be led to imagine if they were a size less,
they would be full as tempting. Can you
place before your eyes, two beds of down
for Cupids to sport on? Such then her
breasts. Would you wish for an _ambush_,
for some of their more wanton brothers
to play at _hide_ and _seek_ in? Show them
her Cyprian mounts. Have you a desire
to roll in the loose luscious lap of lip-
inviting luxury? _Spend_ an hour in her
arms; that is, if Mr. C--tt--n should
not be there first; he being so great a
favourite, she is always denied when in
his company. If not at home, she is to
be found at any of the public hops, and
in general with her favourite man, who
we are told, won her first by virtue of his
fiddle-stick, and has, since her first attach-
ment, kept her in very good tune; if any
of our readers wishes to try a tune with
her, _he_ must pay for it; but she is not at
all exorbitant in her demands, seldom
wishing to turn money away.

Miss Nancy D--v--s, No. 31, _Wells-
              street_.

   Well pleas'd at the _frolic_, she laugh'd at the
      pain,
   And wish'd with more ardour, to try it again;
   Which, when _handled_ and _dandled_, and made
      fit for use,
   She push'd with less pain, as the parts grew
       more loose;
   Then _upping_ and _downing_, kind nature told
      how,
   She cry'd over-raptur'd, it does not hurt now.

   This was her confession to her dear Mr.
Wh--te, had she less partiality for him,
her friends in general would have a greater
partiality for her; she has a tolerable pretty
mouth, we wish we could pay her teeth
the same compliment; that mouth she
thinks serves as an index to its _cousin be-
low_; to be sure she has learned the wrig-
ling part of pleasing, and would willing-
lY make her gentlemen believe, when in
the _heat_ of the engagement,' that he is
giving her pain; but however large the
_premises_ may be, she certainly has attained
a very pleasing method of _contracting them_,
never meeting with one she could not per-
fectly well accommodate, from an infant
                                   shoe

               ( 107 )

shoe to a _jack_ boot. She is of the mid-
dling size, with dark hair and eyes; re-
tains a good complexion without the
assistance of rouge or pearl powder; is
very lively and chearful, and as a conver-
sation piece only, would make the time
pass away agreeable enough, being chear-
ful and good humoured, with a pleasant
smile upon her countenance; will drink
a chearful glass to George the third with
pleasure, and whilst she has the glass in
one hand, has no objection to see his
picture in the other; but sooner than her
dear man should want, she would retail her
charms at five shillings an hour all day
long.

                Miss K--lp--n.

   Those formal lovers be for ever curst,
   Who fetter'd free-born love with honour first;
   Who through fantastic laws, are virtue's fools,
   And against nature, will be slaves to rules.

    We cannot pretend to say where this
curious oddity lives, that being a cir-
cumstance she carefully conceals; and
what is more extraordinary, she never
can be prevailed on to go into taverns or
other houses with a gentleman. To
                             what
               ( 108)

what purpose then (some reader may say)
is she inserted here, if she will not go
into a house to dispense her favors, nor
is it known where she is to be found? A
little patience, good sir, and you will be
informed where she is to be found, and
how to procure her favours. If you
walk on the right hand side of the way,
from the corner of Cheapside along St.
Paul's Church-Yard, and thence to the
bottom of Ludgate-Hill, just after sun-
set, and meet with a beautiful woman
about twenty, tall and finely shaped,
with fine black eyes, and hair of the same
hue, that floats in curls down her back,
and worn without powder, and a be-
witching dimple in each cheek, you may
give a shrewd guess you have found Miss
K--lp--n. Her dress is in general silk,
sometimes a pale blue, but oftener a
black, and a large white sattin cloak,
trimmed and lined with rich brown fur;
her head is in general bedecked with a
blue beaver, with a profusion of white
feathers; and if on accosting her, you
are as much dazzled with her wit, her
smart repartees, and her delicate agree-
able raillery, as with her person and
dress, you may be then absolutely certain
it is the lady.----But you may say, when
                                  found,

                ( 109 )

found, of what service is it, when she
will neither take you home with her,
nor go into any house With you? A little
more patience, sir, if you plase, though
she refuses to go into any _house_ with you,
are there not hackney coaches on every
stand? we have not said she will deny
entering one of them with you; that is
if she likes your person and conversation.
And here let us add, no frothy coxcomb,
no male adonis, conceited of his own
dear person, no shoe stringed effeminate
puppy, no insipid empty chatterer, can
hope to succeed with her.

  If, reader, thou art neither of these,
and should meet with, and please Miss
K--p--n, she will take as length'ned
a ride with you as you please; and if
you have the prudence to draw up
the blinds, she Will be as free as you please,
and you may enjoy her charms, _Jehu_ like,
as long as you can. She is framed for
love, and will melt like a snow ball in the
sun. She will embrace you with un-
feigned rapture, open _all_ her charms to
receive your manly tribute, and perhaps
appoint another meeting.

   We have rather enlarged on this lady,
on account of the singularity of her dis-
position; and what will add to your won-
                                     der

               ( 110 )

der is, that she never will receive any
money, but take the offer as an affront.
These circumstances make us conclude
that K--lp--n, the name she has assumed
sometimes, is not her real name, and
that she is not a woman of the town, but
some married city lady, who takes this
method of getting home deficiencies sup-
plied abroad, and, as she is cautious of
her character, uses these precautions.
By not going to any house, she avoids
detection; by chusing none but those
whose conversation is congenial to her
own, she obliges none but men of sense
and honour; and by he constantly re-
fusing money, she demonstrates that love
for love is her motto; that her love of
the sport is her motive; perhaps she
may have another reason for chusing a
leathern conveniency as the scene of her
delights. We have been told that the
undulating motion of the coach, with
the pretty little occasional jolts, con-
tribute greatly to enhance the pleasure
of the critical moment, if all matters are
rightly placed. This she may have ex-
perienced, and therefore as pleasure is
her search, no wonder she prefers every
delicate addition to the gross sum.

        The critical minute,
   Ensure as fast as you can.

A young tit of Mother Gr--y's own
procuring, and that our reader should
not mistake the old abbess, we will give
a short description of her. If you chance
to visit her in the morning, the smell of
yellow usquebaugh will salute your nos-
trils, of which she takes copious draughts
before breakfast. In all her actions she
shews the lewdness of a monkey, and
the letchery of a goat; she has lately
been _fired_ by P----, the French fri-
zeur, but knowing the use of murcury,
she applied it in such a manner that she
procured an effectual salivation, and
enabled her to take into her house the
fame squinting gentleman that present
acts as her _fine man_; she boasts of her
knowledge of great men, and there is
scarce a lord or duke in the land that
has not been her _cull_.
                                  We

               ( 112 )

   We can but pity our little girl in
question for being so unhappily situated;
she is a charming sprightly lass, and so
fond of kissing, and so perfect a mistress
in the art, that she will frequently force
nature to a dissolving pitch, before the
_right parts_ come in proper contract; her
liveliness of disposition, and activity in
the sports of Venus, make her so desi-
rable a bed-fellow, that her magic _ring_
is as much sought after as the philoso-
pher's stone; has good hair and teeth, a
plump round, firm breast, and confined
merely as an object to sensual desire, pos-
sesses every qualification a sensualift can
desire. She is to be met with every
night at Sterling's, and being newly come
on to the town, and possessing too much
innocence, as well as ignorance, to fight
the world as she ought, she is frequently
bilked; but this there is no doubt she
will soon get the better off, particularly
if she follows the precepts and advice of
the old lady she lives with.

               ( 113 )

Miss Phoebe B--rn, No. 5, _Eagle-
     street, Red Lion Square_.

   Behold her round the vine, in loose attire,
   Her panting bosom thrills with soft desire,
   Which white and firm invites the amorous hand,
   And never fails to make the member stand;
   Then to her couch she'll lead the conquered
      boy,
   Who in her feels a tickling pinching joy.

   Bishopsgate-street is the place that gave
birth to this volatile charmer; her father
moved in the sphere of a hackney-coach-
man, and reared this daughter of Venus
with no small care, till she attained her
sixteenth year, at which period, a young
man about twenty wooed her, and she did
not repulse him; but found his embraces
so agreeable, that she soon wished for
food more substantial than kisses; but
then the thought of sacrificing her cha-
racter to her pleasure was a bar not easily
surmounted, but nature called so loud
for its favorite _choak pear_, that she resolved
to throw herself into the arms of the
vigorous youth, and for the first time
                                  suck

               ( 114 )

suck the juice of the enchanting fruit;
a few promises and vows of his, fully
preponderated all her maiden niceties,
and she soon yielded to the giddy im-
pulse of her passion;

   She did not stay for marriage, that stale
     trick,
   But lost her reputation for a----;

but the cruel laceration that this first
attack was productive of, obliged her to
confine herself to her bed two days, and
led her parents to the discovery of their
daughter's shame, which so highly in-
censed them, that they abandoned her to
the world at large; and from this aera
we may date her entrance into life. The
_Kite_, in _Catherine-street_, first _swooped_ upon
her, and carried her to the _nest_ as a fine
prey, and she was not mistaken; she
proved such, and for six months never
was in want of _culls_; at the end of this
time ihe deserted the mother abbess,
took apartments in Glanville-street, and
traded on her own _bottom_, where she
figured away with tolerable grace for
three months, and then removed to her
prefent situation. She is diminitive in
                                  size,

               ( 115 )

size, with fine black eyes, large firm, and
full breasts, a handsome mouth, pretty
curling brown ringlets, and delicate lit-
tle hands; a very pretty leg and foot,
which is at all times ready to divide and
_house_ its old friend, at the very low price
of one ounce of silver.

   ----------The self same cates
   Still offer'd, soon the appetite offend;
   The most delicious soonest.

How happy would it be for the author
of this anniversary publication, could he
procure a friend to new christen the fea-
tures, that the reader might with less fa-
tigue go through this heap of tautology,
but as that end is not yet accomplished,
we must steer according to the old line,

An eye must still be an eye, and a tooth a tooth;

both of which our young Venus, who has
just reached her seventeenth year, pos-
sesses in a superlative degree. She strong-
ly points to your imagination a casket of
                                   orient

               ( 116 )

orient pearls, the former of two living dia-
monds, whose language so forcibly invite
thq blind boy to the happy cloyster, that
there is seldom many fleeting moments
before an almost involuntary attack must
be made. Her heaving breasts foretell
the _Coming_ joy; the _liquid eye_ declares it
nearer still; the _interrupted sigh_, the sud-
den _gush_, if premature and _involuntary twist_
of the limbs speaks a _flowing_ of the _tide_,
and the critical oh! bids the silly pen
defiance to express. She is of a good size,
and well form'd, of a lively and sweet
disposition, has been but a short time in
life, and has beautiful dark hair;

   Her eye brows arch'd, and rather full than
         thin,
   To shade the dazzling light that dwells within.

She has met with many admirers but
showing lately too great a partiality for
the gentleman whose name she assumes,
( a horse jockey) she has lately sunk a
little in the world; his late inconstancy,
however, has wrought so powerfully upon
her, that she is now soliciting the fa-
vours and support of her old friends; she
is of a good size, and well made, of a
lively and sweet disposition, loves a glass
of Madeira, but never takes a glass in
                                   one

               ( 117 )

one hand without having prudence in
the other, and is particularly careful that
the effects of Bacchus shall not prevent
the more sensible joys, of Venus. Two
pounds two shillings is her price to stran-
gers, but if a very old and good, acquain-
tance, she will not refuse half the sum.

   If any wench Venus's girdle wears,

   Roses and lilys will quickly appear,
      And her face look wond'rous smugly.

   In some respeCt Miss C---- verifies
this remark of Mr. Gay, for very little
else than her wearing Venus's girdle can
invite any to admire so plain a counte-
nance;  she is tall and lusty, with dark
hair and eyes, a very indifferent set of
teeth, and a very flat face; she is now
twenty-five, has followed the trade some
years, and never refuses any sum scarce
that is offered her.

   Nature for meat and drink provides a place,
   And when receiv'd they fill their certain space;
   Hence _thirst_ and _hunger_ may be satisfy'd,
   But this repletion is to love deny'd.

   This pretty piece of animation wants
not the aid of art to make  her shine one
of the most conspicuous in the list of tra-
ding nymphs; altho' she cannot be called
very handsome, still she is a fine girl,
and nature has sufficiently furnish'd her
with those beauties the nicest hand of
art would only deface. Her want of
pride (which is in this age a very rare
perfection) sets off to superior advantage
every feature; her goodness of temper
and disposition acts as a security to her
most valuable acquaintance, and her just-
ness of principle gains her the esteem of
all who have the happiness of knowing
her. She is the daughter of a gentleman
who holds a considerable place under
government, has had a genteel education,
and seems quite untainted with the vices
of the town; her great attachment to Mr.
J----n, of the theatre, is a bar to her see-
ing much company; with them that has
the good fortune to sleep with her, will find
                                          she

               ( 119 )

she still enjoys the pleasure without the
least satiety; no licenc'd fair during the
honey moon can charm with more rapture,
or feel the poignant bliss with more ex-
tacy; every inviting motion is us'd, every
limb employ'd, to make the dying tran-
sports meet. Her own home is the place
where she in general sees her company, and
every visitor that passes the night in her
arms, she expects will make her two
guineas richer.

   Fancy itself, e'en in enjoyment, is

   Mrs. W--bst--r is the daughter of a
gentleman, deceased, has received a good
education, which she improves by an
excellent natural understanding; her age
is twenty-one, her figure tall, and every
limb elegantly proportioned; she pos-
sesses an agreeable face, but we will not
flatter her by calling it a pretty one, be-
ing too thinly formed to constitute beau-
ty, and too much pitted with the small
pox to be stiled handsome; still she
                         commands

               ( 120 )

commands a beautiful pair of dark eyes,
which give a most pleasing, amorous
expression to her whole countenance, and
makes her, tho' not a pretty, still a very
desirable girl; she possesses a lively and
entertaining manner, with an affable dis-
position, and refined, delicate sentiments,
which has lately been much been abused
by the brutality of her late keeper, Mr.
K--d, well known at Garraway's cof-
fee house, for the lowness of his birth,
and still greater meanness of his senti-
ments. He was some time since a corn-
factor, but has now relinquished that,
and nOw all his business, delight, and
employment, seems to be that of perse-
cuting Mrs. W----. In the course of
last summer he arrested her for the pal-
try sum a of twenty-five pounds, which,
from the natural consequences of not
paying immediately, amounted to sixty
pounds, and upwards. Indeed, could
the Whole conduct of this old r--l be
summed up, it would be impossible to
describe his cruelty to Mrs. W. which
proceeds merely from his resolution not
to live with a wretch, whose cruelty,
and her own disposition, obliges her to
despise. It is from such kind of usage
as this that has taught Mrs. W. prudence
                                     and

               [ 121 ]

and discretion in all her engagements
with the men, nor will she ever admit a
visitor to take any liberties, without first
knowing the value he fits on her com-
pany; and from the appearance which
her present keeper enables her to make,
she expects to be something consider-
able.

   Panting she lay, and fetch'd long double sighs,
   Whilst with thick mists pleasure had dimmed
      her eyes.

   Some girls have been debauched by
delusive arts, and under promises of mar-
riage, and others have commenced har-
lots through want, but neither of these
motives actuated this lady's principles;
it was mere lewdness that overpowered
all nature's works, and stamped the princi-
ples of conjunction and copulation at a
very early period: Ere twelve summers
had warmed her constitution, she learned
the use of different machines, and felt
the effects of friction as soon as she had
any genial fluid within her. Who first
stamped her virgin mould, we are at a
loss to tell, but from the luxuriance of
                                     the

               ( 123 )

the present soil, guess it was broke open
at an early period. She is a very luscious
looking piece, with dark eyes and hair, a
very good complexion, tall, and genteely
formed, with a charming slender leg, and
a pretty foot, which she never troubles
the gentlemen to stoop very low to have
a perfect view of. She is very good na-
tured, sings a good song, and is in bed a
charming companion, particularly at this
season of the year; for she is desirous of
having every part in contact the whole
night. In regard to price, she has one
fixed rule; she always measures a gentle-
man's _may-pole_ by a standard of _nine
inches_, and expects a guinea for every
inch it is short of full measure.

   She thrust among the bushes her fair hand,
   To draw the plant; and every plant she drew,
   She shook the stalk, and brushed away the dew.

   This lady's character answers exceed-
ingly well to her name, being exquisitely
well skilled in the art of _raising_ plants in
a _hot-bed_; this she practices on her own
                                   _bottom_,

concerned in the business. Her person is
pleasing, she has the roses in her cheeks,
encircled with beds of never fading lilys;
is as strait as a pine of two years growth,
though not quite so tall; her locks shine
like black maiden hair, and she is as full
of juice as a _ripe amber goose-berry_; she
takes a guinea to be _engrafted_ upon, and
is a very agreeable sprig of _hare-hound_.
She is much esteemed by the lovers of
_planting_, for having a beautiful show of
_navel-wort_, and her fondness for _rampions_
and _amber vitae_, she despises _fool-stones_,
_cuckow pintle_, _Jews ears_, or _birch_; but
particularly likes _Adam's Apple-tree_, _sensi-
tive plant_, _stich-wort_, _nutmegs_, and such
valuable productions. To all such she is
free, for her _lips_ opens her _lady's mantle_,
encloses them in her _convolvulus_, pours
down a whole volley of _seed_, and never
quits them whilst they have a _drop_ of _sap_.

the breasts fully speak her inward feel-

for her immoderate fondness for sugar

induced, her to take the famous little
Jemmy B--tl--r into her train, the
_upper mouth_ he keeps constantly supplied
with its favourite food; but we fear
_Jemmy_ has not parts sufficient to supply
the _lower_ with a tenth part of _its_ neces-

favours of the good natured public for
the necessary supplies to that inchanting
spot. She is of a good size, and every
limb well proportioned. Knowing the
beauty of her hand and arm, she takes
particular care they shall not pass un-
noticed for want of being seen; convinced
of the delicate proportion of her leg and
foot, she is very careful their covering
shall not discredit them, and has a
pleasing knack of keeping them con-
stantly exposed to sight; and being
taught by the eyes of her admirers the
influence her neck and breasts command,
she covers them with so thin a veil, that
the smallest blue branch is easily
covered; her eyes she cannot hide, nor
does she wish it; they are plain indications

   ---------What woman, when
   Her blood boils up, and wantons in her veins,
   When her hot panting pulse beats to the joy;
   What woman then would quench her generous
      flame
   in an inactive tedious husband's arms,
   That fires and jades our expectation
   In the first stretch of love; then duly falls
   To his old trot, and drudges out the course?

   Altho' we cannot assert that this lady
is actually married, we can with truth
venture to affirm there are many that
have entered the matrimonial circle,
that does not possess the same degree of
constancy for their husbands, as this
lady does for her generous keeper. He
is to be sure an Hibernian gentleman
and a captain, two powerful inducements,
or rather compellers, to her keeping
                              within

               ( 127 )

within bounds; the first being generally
passionate and cruel when irritated, and
the profession of the latter is, we must
imagine, a powerful bar. But still she is
not impregnable, and where a gentle-
man (for that he must be) possesses the
proper means, there is not much doubt
of his success; flattery is a bait that few
females can withstand, let every word
and action be well cloathed in her
richest garb; this incense must be of-
fer'd at the shrine with pains, perseverance,
honour, secrecy, and liberality join-
ed with it, and when she is thoroughly
convinced that you possess all these re-
quisites, she will unfold her _haven_ of
delight, and put you in possession of
such charms that would not disgrace a
monarch's couch; her tell-tale lascivious
eye acts as a charming index to that un-
quenchable flame that fills the whole
frame, and swallows up the other senses;
she is rather short, but admirably well
made, and when once convinced of the
_honour_ and parts of her paramour, gives
such a loose to her unbounded appetite,
that very few of the Cyprian choir can
match her.

Miss H--ll--n, No. 2, _Glanville-street_.

   Oh she is all the heart would wish, or eye admire,
   The purest child of love by beauty fir'd;
   Whom but to love, need only but to see,
   To see, admire, such heaven born symmetry;
   To touch, to feel, ah, there's the potent hold
   That chains the will, and molds the snowy heart
   To love's delightful glow; the milky hills
   Half rising, half suppress'd, with glowing ardor
   Ask corporeal pressure, and invite
   The _carnal weapon_ to its burning sheath.

   This lady, in consequence of a trivial
fall out with her parents, (which by the
bye she had long sought for)left her home,
and flushed with all the fire of youth
impetuous; burning with every desire
the young hand of lust could create, and
still a stranger, except in idea, to the
grand _subduer_ of their fires, she sought
this expanded field of delight, nor sought
in vain; her youth and person soon
attracted the eye of an old male veteran
in our band, and her innocence and
simplicity were soon overpowered, her
maiden honours plucked, and all her
virgin claims at once lie dead. The
lively girl in question is now entering
her sixteenth year, has only been four
                                months

               ( 129 )

months on the town, the thinly _covered_
grot below has therefore not yet suffi-
ciently felt the general influence of its
much sought for _acquaintance_, to be
very thickly covered, still she thinks it
proof against any attack, nor fears to
meet the most vigorous, tho' destitute
of every other weapon. She is rather
darkly complexioned, with fine hazel eyes,
is short, and inclinable to be lusty, and
as pretty a leg and foot as man would
wish to divide, which any good natured
man, with two guineas in his pocket
that he has no objection to spare, may
lie between the whole livelong night,
and taste all the raptures he can possibly
expect to meet with, in one as yet so
untutored in the art.

      Le tresor le plus charmant,
   je vous en donnerois en gage,
      Et mon coeur pour un present.

   It is only six months that this lady has
left her native country, and at present
                                 speaks

               ( 130 )

speaks very little English. She is young
and lively, (but still does not seem to
possess so much vivacity as the majority
of her countrywomen;) she loves to
revenge her countrymen's cause on the
English, by doing what the most valor-
ous Frenchman would never effect, that
is, to bring Britons on their knees; she
is now about twenty two, rather short
and fat, with a plump face, and such a
roguish lear in her eye, that cannot be
resisted. Several of our brave officers
have spent some of their _best blood_ in her
service, and regretted they had no more
to _shed_. Her lovely dark hair seems like
a net to catch lovers, and her lower tend-
rils, which sport on her alabaster mount
of Venus, are formed to give delight. She
has one qualification which many English
girls want, which is a certain cleanliness
in the Netherlands. They are contented
to wash their faces, necks, and hands;
but Mademoiselle, like many of her
countrywomen, thinks that not enough;
she performs constant ablutions on the
gulph of pleasure, and keeps it constantly
fresh, cool, and clean, never putting
a morsel into that mouth, till she has
fully absterged every possible remnant of
the last meal. She constantly mounts
                                 her

               ( 131 )

her _bidet_, and with a large sponge laves
the whole extent of the parish of the
mother of all saints. Some may, perhaps,
think her a female spy, or a smuggler;
but surely a girl, who so freely discloses
her own secrets, can have no improper
aim at those of government; and her
commodity cannot be pronounced as
contraband when it hath so often been
duly entered.

She dresses quite in the French stile
and taste, lays on a profusion of rouge
and pearl powder, and is not particularly
partial to money, but will condescend to
take a couple of guineas, _not as payment,
but solely as 'une gage d'amour_.

Miss Emma Ell--tt, No. 8, _Action-
      street, Gray's-Inn-Lane_.

   Our souls their former joys renew,
    We raise new sport, and wanten jesting;
   Our eyes each others charms review,
    In every form of love contesting.
   At last, our body's warm'd with mutual
     fire,
   To prove each others aid to join in one
    conspire.

   This truly lovely woman is about
twenty, and, whilst she remains in a
                                state

               ( 132 )

state of silence, commands every attract-
ing charm the heart of man can wish;
she speaks French tolerably well, and
sings inimitably; she has now trod the
path of love four years, during which,
time pretty Emma has experienced every
vicissitude the cruel hand of fortune could
possibly inflict. At present Mr. B. a
merchant, in Castle-Court, is the gen-
tleman from whom she derives her prin-
cipal support; she has fine blue melting
eyes, with an aquiline nose, and a very
pretty mouth, when her tongue is in-
active, but when once she gives a loose
to that unruly member, she pours forth
such a torrent of blackguardism that shall
destroy every attracting feature, and
spoil one of the most desirable looking
girls in the _Cyprian market_. Our damsel
is therefore the most agreeable looking
girl when asleep; in bed she is truly
amorous, and a charming sportswoman,
and when one strain is finished, cries, _da
capo_, with a good grace, for which she
expeas five guineas.


                                   Miss

               ( 133 )


Miss T--f--n, No. 2, _Glanville-Street_.

   Had love's fair goddess been so strong in charms,
   Rash Diomede had dropt his vent'rous arms;
   No shameful victory the Greek had won,
   But had a thousand wounds receiv'd instead of
         giving one.

   This tit bit is not above sixteen, ra-
ther short; but pretty, having an excel-
lent complexion, with fine blue eyes,
light hair, and a very white, and regular
set of teeth. Altho' she has not been six
months upon the _Pave de Londres_, (hav-
ing received a complete education, has
learnt to dance, speak French, and play
upon the guittar; and has likewise been
initiated into all the mysteries of the
Cyprian school; having read _les Bejoux
Indiscrets_; the _Woman of Pleasure_; Ro-
chester's Poems;) she is _au fait de tout_.
Add to this, she has often viewed with
rapture all _Aretin's_ postures, and longed
for the practice, as well as the theory.
No wonder then that she should be in-
clined to give delight in every possible
attitude, and has no kind of objection to
yield, with becoming modesty, to take
a _coup_ a la _levrette_. She is at present in
keeping by a citizen, who has suffered
                                   her

               ( 134 )

her to assume his name, but is always
pleased when Mr. T. is not with her, to
accommodate any gentleman in her _pret-
ty apartment_ a whole night, for which
she expects two guineas.

Miss Harriet B--r--n, No. 8, _Tavi-
             stock-row_.

   In framing thee, heav'n took unusual care,
   And stampt thee fairest of the _Cretan_ fair.

   There is something so very engaging
in the person of this lady, that those gen-
tlemen, who once visit her, seldom or
ever fail repeating it. In her deportment
she is free and open, without the least
tinge of affectation, in size rather below
mediocrity, fine dark hair, and bewitch-
ing black eyes; a complexion between
the fair and brunette: her features are
remarkably delicate, and, conjunctively
taken, fully verifies the Poet.

   None can observe her features but approve,
   There's grace with beauty, dignity with love.

Her breasts are finely proportioned, and
delicately moulded for love's tender attack,
and swell and recede the melting lan-
                                guage


               ( 135 )

guage of the heart; the _grove beneath_,
delicately shaded by a _sable thicket_, is
fraught with all its proper sensibility,
and, well knowing the value of her charms,
she is not one that can be sported with,
not will she suffer any liberty beyond the
strictest bounds of decency to take place,
without the payment of one piece before
hand.

Miss W--ll--ms, No. 3, _Glanville-
             street_.

   Firm breasts, white belly, and such thighs,
   Gaze ghastly envy, and forget her size.

   This lady's affable temper, and en-
gaging disposition, fully compensates
for her size, which is rather diminutive,
and the innumerable beauties of	her face,
when put in competition with this defi-
ciency, ought entirely to efface the small-
est idea of it. From her youth we might
be led to imagine her deficient in the
practice of love, but we can assure our
readers he will meet but few in the _cy-
prian field_ that will shew better sport;
her hair is a beautiful glossy dark brown;
her eye brows finely arc'd, and of the
                                  same

               ( 136 )

same hue, which, contrasted by a pair of
beautiful cerulean eyes, and cheeks of
living roses and lilies, places her in the
rank of first rate beauties,

   Her rising breasts two hillocks are of snow,
   On which two little fragrant rose buds grow;

below which descends the smooth track
of a belly, which conveys to the mind an
idea of animated ivory, at the bottom
of which is display'd a lovely chesnut
fringe, terminated by a pouting _slash hole_,
which is far from being insensible to the
raptures of its _grisly antagonist_, and with
pleasure _opens_ its _mouth_ to receive his well
erected crest, who _enters_ with his accus-
tomed pride, but soon returns with _fal-
len head_, as if conscious of its presumption;
but the _mistress_ of this formidable _enemy_
is well acquainted with the means of re-
storing life to the _vanquished memmber_, but
only to make it more sensible of its ina-
bility. Mercenary views are far from
what she aims at; she can give and
receive a _luscious_ share of pleasures
of _copulation_; but beginning to know the
accustom'd ways of the baser sort of
men, and not being always confident of
the honour of her _paramour_, if he is a
                               stranger,

               ( 137 )

stranger, she must receive her compli-
ment of half a guinea, or a guinea, ac-
cording to the length of the intended
visit, before she proceeds to any kind of
business.

Miss Fanny H--nl--y, No 14, _King-

   Her every thought, and wishes, and desires,
   Agree with yours, and burn with mutual fires.

   This merry, little lively tit appears to
be about sixteen, and is never to be met
without a smile upon her countenance,
and a frisky song at her tongue's end;
she is very short, a brunette in com-
plexion, with a lustfully sparkling eye,
and jetty ringlets down her back. The sis-
ter hills, with their bewitching coral
pinnacles, are irresistibly firm, and speak
their silent language very forcibly to the
heart. The grove beneath, shading the
font of life, is drest in sable, and se-
cures the _internal mansion_ from any sud-
den _attack_. She is generally very expe-
ditious in dying, therefore we would ad-
vise her antagonist to push the warm con-
                                     test

               ( 138 )

est with agility, or it will not be a _dead_
heat; she is a very willing and amorous
bedfellow, never against repetition, and
such a good natured, and good tem-
per'd creature, that she seems to say to
every one,

   With thee secur'd,--I'd smile at fortune's
        frowns,
   And all her threats defy,--nor court her
        smiles.

   You gaulky steeple, you stalking stag,
   Your husband must come from Brobdignag.

   It is a pity that so noble a piece could
not be preserved solely for the use of his
Majesty's Grenadiers; she is more than
six foot; she is now about twenty-five,
possesses an elegance in her person, (we
wish we could pay the same compliment
to her actions) light hair and eyes, which
are continually lighted up by the all pow-
erful brandy bottle; as she excells in the
height of stature so is she the height of
good nature, for she never refuses any
                             gentleman

               ( 139 )

gentleman her favors, that has any mo-
ney in his pocket; she is surely too the
height of vulgarity, for she will come
her _eyes and limbs_, with any lady from
Billingsgate, or Jack tar from Wapping;
but her greatest fault, and what makes
more disgusting her other imperfections,
is her violent attachment to drinking;
she generally contrives to pin her basket
completely by nine o'clock; then she
swears most abominably, and is as great
a proficient in barefaced indecency, as
Messalina of antient Rome. We there-
fore set her up as a beacon; in spite of
all, when she pleases, she can be a good
companion, and speaks the English lan-
guage remarkably well; she is never de-
nied to any one, except Mr. G. a watch-
maker, in the city, should be engaged
with her, he being her particular friend.

in the eyes of all her friends; Mr.

is now rather in the wane, having seen
at least twenty-eight summers, tall, and
very well proportioned; her complexion
is but indifferent, but, being a native of
Germany, is not to be wondered at; she
speaks French also, but we cannot get
her to confess she has been ten years on
the town, unless you pay her a _guinea fee_
for confessing.

Mrs. Gr--ff--n , _near Union-Stairs,

This is a comely woman, about forty,
and boasts she can give more pleasure
than a dozen raw girls. Indeed she has
acquired great experience, in the course
of twenty years study, in _natural philpsophy_,
in the university of Portsmouth, where
she was long the ornament of the back
of the point. She is perfectly mistress
                                     of

               [ 142 ]

of all her actions, and can proceed re-
gularly from the dart of her tongue, and
the soft tickle of her hand, to the exta-
tic squeeze of her thighs; the enchanting
twine of her legs; the elaborate suction
of her lower lips, and the melting flood
of delight, with which she constantly
bedews the _mossy root_ of the tree of _life_,
and washes the testimonies of man-
hood; tho' past her meridian, she is
still agreeable; her eyes are black as
well as her hair, of which she has an
abundance both above and below, her
breasts are large but not flabby, and her
skin is fair.	Five shillings is her price,
and she earns it with great industry: but
if her lover seems capable of prolonging
the _delicious banquet_, and is remarkably
well provided, she will abate _weight_ for
_inches_. Her chief and best customers
are sea officers, whom she particularly
likes, as they do not stay long at home,
and always return fraught with love and
presents.

   It voit un trou, le joli precipice;
   Ce n'etact point le trou de saint Patrice.

   This lady has lately been a teacher in a
French boarding fchool, but taking a li-
king to a young Clergyman in the neigh-
bourhood, she made a conjunction of
calvanism with the established church,
and he propagated the gospel in her _fo-
reign parts_ with great assiduity; but her
immoderate love of the sport, after
having once tasted the power of the _Bri-
tish constitution_, speedily brought her to
our market, here to her great discredit
and loss she has form'd a connection
with a boy by the name of N--wb--y,
brother to the noted attorney well known
as a flash man among the ladies, and one
whose principles will not bear the strictest
scrutiny. She is a tall, genteel looking
                                 figure,

               ( 144 )

figure, speaks English pretty well, fine
dark eyes and hair, a tolerable complex-
ion, thanks to Mr. Warren, who oc-
casionally fills up those indentions the
small pox has been busy in making, and
makes her a desirable piece enough.
Her low countries are said to be of am-
ple dimensions, and she is so publick spir-
ited, that she makes no distinction of
persons or nations; but will say, _je vous
remercie_, to any man for the smallest
piece of gold.

   This is a fine girl, lately come from
Cambridge, and just dancing into her
twentieth year, we have known her but
a very little time, but from her com-

                         brunette,

brunette; her lively hazel eyes, and
the lovely pouting orbs of nature, we can
venture to affirm her no bad sportswoman;
the _grove beneath_ is beautifully border'd
by a _sable fringe_, the _ruby portals_ of
which when unfolded, display the _coral

excuse that disagreeable tautology, which,
for want of other words, we are necessi-

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
