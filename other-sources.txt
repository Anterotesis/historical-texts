Significant sources of pre-1800 English texts.

This is a list of significant, sizeable and freely available collections of pre-1800 British texts. They have varying amounts of post-1800 material, are of various languages, different standards of OCR and mark-up, etc. Some are derived from manuscript sources rather than print. Because I'm interested in 'distant reading', I've generally noted the ease (or not) of downloading texts in bulk.

Listing here does not preclude or imply incorporation into the main Historical Texts project. If there are suitable repositories I have missed, please open an issue on the github tracker.

British Library
https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Commons:British_Library/Mechanical_Curator_collection/Full_list_of_books_1
British Library books digitized by Microsoft, with images, used for the Mechanical Curator project. I beleive that there are many other digitized volumes, but am uncertain of their details.
